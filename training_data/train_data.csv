"The Ministry of Education has been publishing the results of the Graduate Employment Survey (GES) for Autonomous Universities (AUs) since 2008. The GES provides  (a) Prospective students with timely and comparable data to assist them in making informed course decisions; and (b) Stakeholders such as the AUs, governmental agencies and employers with information to assess the industry demand for the AUs’ graduates. The GES findings have helped our AUs to track their graduates’ employment outcomes. MOE factually presents data, such as starting salaries and employment rates, based on the course of study. While the starting salaries of graduates from the various courses are a point of reference, they should not be the main or sole criterion for students in deciding what to study. Students should choose their desired courses holistically based on their interests, abilities and aspirations, aside from the immediate employment outcomes from the various courses of study."
"Mr Chairman, I would like to post a question to Minister Chan. We all know Singapore is now a mature economy in transition, and also our economy is still facing the impact of the global pandemic crisis. I hope we will all not be laud into this false notion that sectors and businesses are all doing well and the economy will be back to the pre-COVID-19 situation. I think Minister Chan mentioned about this earlier on, I just wanted to reiterate a point. But, there are opportunities to capture value going forward. MTI spoke at at length about the many different strategies to help our economy recover and emerge stronger. These are good but multifaceted. So, among these, Minister Chan, can you help tell us or explain to us how Singapore can be different from others to beat the competition? I think this is very important and very key. Your elucidation will help us all focus on the key areas and most importantly, stay positive for the future."
"We recognise that there is heritage value in the Bukit Brown municipal cemetery. This is why government agencies, including the National Heritage Board (NHB), have been working with experts and stakeholders on various efforts to document and commemorate the memories of Bukit Brown for future generations. The NHB is also studying how the heritage of Bukit Brown can be preserved, taking into account future development plans for the area. Not all sites with local heritage value will qualify as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The standards required by UNESCO are very stringent, especially to meet the criteria of ""outstanding universal value"". This was why when the Ministry first explored the possibility of a UNESCO listing, it had engaged a technical expert to do a thorough and in-depth assessment to determine the site with the best chance of meeting the UNESCO criteria. As part of this process, we had done a consultation on possible sites that could be put up for the UNESCO bid. At that time, none of our stakeholders had surfaced the Bukit Brown cemetery as a candidate for consideration. As I had mentioned previously in Parliament, having worked through an extensive process of identifying the Singapore Botanic Gardens as our first nomination for the UNESCO World Heritage Site, our efforts are now focussed on this bid. This will also give us an opportunity to better understand UNESCO’s requirements and processes, before exploring other possibilities in the future."
"Thank you, Mr Chairman. Still on this subject of retirement age. I agree with Minister Lim that the statutory retirement age works towards protecting the workers, giving them the right and peace of mind and confidence to work. My clarification is on the other end of it. Although the statutory retirement age in Singapore now is 62, there are companies in Singapore today, for example, companies under the ComfortDelgro group who have done their own calculations and have implemented company policy to retire or offer retirement age above the statutory retirement age, that is, 65 or 67, and there are other companies in Singapore doing the same. That also then fits the company's own realities or industry's own realities, and it offers the employees added assurance as well. So, my question to the Minister is, whether the Ministry would consider that this is an area where the tripartite partners can work together on, to widen their awareness of this possibility, so that all companies can look at their situation and avail themselves and their workers of this option and possibility?"
"I am really heartened by Minister's sharing of that particular hiring scheme. I think it is one of the best kept secrets, and I want to honour the Minister for promoting that. But looking at the outcomes, which is about 300 out of more than 100,000 staff in the Public Service, I think that even the scheme must have been facing some obstacles or barriers to achieve the kind of results that we would like to see. I would like to ask the Minister to consider actually setting a target and really also honoring and recognising those agencies, leaders and peers who actually adopt inclusive employment practices, to their peers. Even if the Public Service starts by saying, ""It might end up as tokenism"", there will be some who feel like they might as well make it worthwhile if they were doing it anyway. So, I would seek Minister's favourable consideration to at least set a soft target."
"Mr Speaker, outages and disruptions can happen to any digital service, including those hosted on cloud services. The recent service degradation at a Microsoft data centre had limited impact on Government services. Nonetheless, GovTech has been working with Microsoft to fully restore affected services and prevent similar occurrences in future. In general, cloud service providers offer improved availability, scalability and cost efficiency. These advantages were most evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, when we could quickly deploy services to support national efforts, such as contact tracing, proximity tracking and distribution of face masks. To qualify for Government procurement, cloud services providers must meet our criteria for availability, resilience and security. The same criteria apply regardless of the service provider’s ownership and location of data centres. The services are regularly monitored to ensure compliance with agreed service levels and stringent security standards. Prior to this incident, cloud service providers had been able to meet our requirement to be available at least 99.9% of the time."
"Chairman, Singapore has had a long and cordial relationship with China. We have been cooperating in many areas, including investment and trading, and have deep and robust ties through our joint entities and our people. Since 2013, China has been Singapore’s largest trading partner, and Singapore has been China’s largest foreign investor. Quite a number of Singaporeans and Chinese also share family ties. Both countries are committed to the many growing areas of cooperation and it can be seen in how both established a fast lane in early June 2020 to facilitate essential business and official travel. This is significant because the fast lane was China’s first with a Southeast Asian country. Singapore has enjoyed good relations with Japan and South Korea as well. Many Japanese and Korean companies have made investments and set up offices in Singapore. Singaporeans are very familiar with Japanese and South Korean products, entertainment and cultural influence. Japan and South Korea have been two of the most popular travel destinations among Singaporeans. There are many Japanese and Korean families living and working here as well. What steps have we taken to broaden our bilateral ties and strengthen our cooperation with China, Japan and the Republic of Korea amidst the pandemic? How will these ties translate into cooperation in technological and business development on the ground for the benefit of all parties?"
"The Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) was launched in 2001 to provide direct lift access to flats and enhance convenience for residents, especially the elderly and the less mobile. At the start of the programme, there were more than 5,300 HDB blocks without 100% lift access. Among them, more than 1,000 blocks were initially found to be unfeasible for LUP due to prohibitive cost or technical constraints. Over the years, HDB has adopted innovative technical solutions such as lifts that do not have a machine room at the top of the shafts (i.e. machine room-less lifts) and the use of smaller ""home lifts"" to help such blocks to have direct lift access. Through these efforts, the vast majority of the 5,300 blocks are now able to benefit from LUP. There remains only about 150 blocks where it is still not possible to implement LUP due to prohibitive cost, or existing technical or site constraints. On a flat basis, less than 1% of our sold flats do not have direct lift access. Residents who are in urgent need of direct lift access due to medical conditions or disability may approach HDB for housing and financing assistance. They have to submit relevant documents, such as the doctor's certification of their medical condition. Over the past five years, HDB has received 23 such appeals, and has acceded to 22% of them. HDB will continue to assess such requests on a case-by-case basis, and see how best to render help. The Member also asked whether blocks with lifts approaching 28 years of age could be granted LUP. I would like to clarify that LUP is not intended to assist Town Councils with their statutory duty to carry out renewal or replacement of common property such as lifts. We have already introduced initiatives such as the Lift Replacement Fund and Lift Maintenance Grants for this purpose."
"Over the last three years, MOM and TAFEP received 65 complaints or feedback regarding the hiring of foreigners in financial institutions. In most cases, the complainants did not provide specific information for follow up action. Of those that did, MOM and TAFEP investigated thoroughly and took appropriate actions, including withholding of work pass privileges. Locals hold more than four out of five jobs paying $3,600 or more (the minimum qualifying salary for Employment Pass) in the financial sector. This ratio has held steady over the last three years, even as the workforce in the sector grew. While most financial institutions and hiring managers understand the need to hire based on merit, there is a minority of employers that seek to circumvent our fair hiring requirements. MOM does not tolerate any form of workplace discrimination, and has recently raised penalties across the board for all forms of discrimination. Beyond the employers, MOM will also take individual employees to task if they were involved in any unfair hiring practices. Beyond complaints, MOM has enhanced our detection of unfair hiring behaviour through data analytics. We urge members of the public to report to MOM or TAFEP if they come across workplace discrimination, and provide specific information so that we can take action. The identity of whistleblowers will be kept confidential."
"The Workfare Income Supplement Scheme provides cash supplements and CPF top-ups that encourages eligible lower-income workers to work regularly and build up their CPF savings.  Workfare boosts the incomes of these workers by up to 30 per cent. Payouts are generally higher for older workers. Persons with disabilities below age 35 can also receive Workfare. From 2017 to 2019, an annual average of about 400,000 employees and self-employed persons received Workfare. About 45,000 were aged 35 to 44, 85,000 were aged 45 to 54, 70,000 were aged 55 to 59 and 195,000 were aged 60 and above. Another 3,000 persons with disabilities below age 35 received Workfare. Workfare has been regularly reviewed since its launch in 2007. The qualifying income ceiling and payouts have been raised on four occasions. In fact, the maximum Workfare payout was just increased by up to 14 per cent starting from January this year. We will continue to review Workfare regularly to ensure the target groups are supported."
"Thank you, Madam. Two clarifications for the Senior Minister of State on her response to my cuts. The first is regarding the disclosure regime and whether other statutes, for example, the PCA, would be brought under it. The Senior Minister of State seemed to suggest that it is something discretionary and may or may not happen. But my question is  should we not proceed on the basis of whether there is any good reason why it should not be brought under that regime? After all, is it not desired to have uniformity in these pre-trial disclosures, especially for cases heard by the District Court? The second clarification is concerning the issue of video recording. The Senior Minister of State appeared, in the gist of her remarks, to say that this issue is actually an MHA issue. Perhaps, she would like to clarify because, historically, MinLaw has taken ownership of this issue of video recording, both in the CPC review in 2010 as well as certain statements made to the media about this issue. I would like to ask  does MinLaw not have an interest in the standards of evidence brought before the Court? And how Court time is used? In fact, Mr Kumar also alluded to the fact that much Court time is being used now to refute such allegations which I think video recording could somewhat mitigate. In other countries, it has been shown that prosecutors are pushing for this because they have found the value in video recording in the handling of trials. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State what is actually MinLaw's ownership of this issue or whether it is just something which they think MHA should take the lead on from now on?"
"Thank you, Madam. I would like to seek two clarifications from the Second Minister. First is that I do not think I got a reply to my query as to the update of how the clean energy industry is developing against the stated target of $1.7 billion in contribution to GDP and employment of 7,000 by 2015, which is just two years away. The second clarification is that the Second Minister reiterated that the Government does not subsidise energy use. The Government has, however, found it necessary sometimes to support some industries. For example, in the high-speed broadband industry, it subsidies infrastructure which, in a way, is bringing down the cost to consumers. Germany may have scaled down the FIT support, but it had used FIT to jump start the solar industry to become the leader in the world today in this industry. So I urge the Government to look beyond R&D support to have schemes to kick-start large scale pilot use of renewable energy in the private sector and not just focus on R&D."
"Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I think what I have just experienced in this House reinforces the point I would like to make, which is to clarify that — Thank you, first of all, Deputy Prime Minister, for addressing the point that I and Ms Nadia Samdin made about slowing down. I would like to clarify that the proposal that I made is not to make a slowdown so that we will not have growth in our economy, but that perhaps slowing down is the approach to help us achieve better growth in our economy. I think many in this House and also many of our Singaporeans can attest that when we are all overworked, spending too many hours in too many meetings, what happens is our brains – and science supports this – our brains go into what we call 钻牛角尖 mode. 分明讲的清清楚楚听起来糊里糊涂. In the end, we end up in very unproductive, unconstructive meetings – like this very, very protracted housing debate, for example. So, I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister to consider and invite him in his already very stretched bandwidth, whether in this tripartism that we have, that is such a beautiful and unique way of managing Singapore, whether we can approach productivity in a slightly different way with a commitment and a focus on our people's wellness. I think if we just slow down a little bit, we may be able to harness more clarity, more creativity in our people when we are less stressed. So, that is only thing I am asking. Can we consider the possibility that taking a slowdown can actually help us to boost the creative potential that we have as a people?"
"Madam, MOE and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHL) will play an increasingly important role in enabling Singaporeans to engage in life-long learning. We must continue to enlarge the pathways and accessibility to education in Singapore. The credit scheme introduced by the Government will certainly spark off a lot of interest for working adults to keep on acquiring or learning new skills. Through continuous self-improvement even well into working life, they will achieve mastery in whatever jobs they do. I am confident this will allow them to develop new skills, should they wish to switch to new industries or whatever new things they want to do when the economy continues to restructure. In other words, they will be futurised, like what Mr Lim Swee Sway said, to thrive in a competitive and rapidly changing global economy. I hope our IHL and training centres will be able to meet the thirst of Singaporeans who want to acquire knowledge. But we need to ensure that there are enough places for our students and our workers, and also to ensure that it is accessible to all our students at every level of our education system. I would like to know what is the Ministry doing to oversee the quality of such courses and to ensure that all the time, energy and investment spent by our students and our workers will follow through to a good matching to a good paying employment and career."
"Mr Chairman, in Malay, please. (In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.]   Many of our young people have achieved success in their professions and made their mark in their careers and contributions to society. Some have even received international accolades. Their stories of perseverance have been featured in mainstream media and social media. Their peers and others in our community are proud of their achievements and see them as sources of inspiration. I am pleased that there are also a good number of them that care for others and have a strong desire to give back to the community. We should tap on their energy and life experiences as well as empower them with opportunities and platforms to continue their good work and encourage others. How can we mobilise these individuals to contribute towards the development of our nation and community?"
"Sir, in Malay, please. (In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] 	Our asatizahs are integral figures in guiding and shaping the beliefs of the Muslim community and, thus far, they have done well in their work. Asatizahs can and should use their influence to reach out and contribute towards other communities’ needs. Outside of the traditional religious institutions, there are areas where their experience and knowledge will come in useful, such as counselling, rehabilitation of ex-offenders and other forms of social work. However, professional skills and qualifications are requirements in social work. Hence, asatizahs who are thinking of exploring other opportunities to serve the community will also need to work towards achieving the relevant professional skillsets for such roles. How will MUIS support asatizahs in these endeavours? What other professional development award schemes that asatizahs can tap on or use to develop their capabilities?"
"Climate change is an existential challenge for Singapore and we take it very seriously. We have continually reviewed and enhanced our climate targets and preparations. Last year, we submitted our enhanced 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution, or NDC, and our Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy, or LEDS. This year, we launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030, which sets out a roadmap towards sustainable development and net-zero emissions. Our goal is to peak emissions around 2030 and halve our emissions by 2050. We have put in place a broad-based carbon tax so that companies internalise the cost of carbon, and we will be reviewing the tax trajectory and level, post-2023, to reflect the increased urgency for climate action. We aim for our energy and chemicals sector to be amongst the best-in-class in energy and carbon efficiency globally. We have introduced an enhanced set of Industry Energy Efficiency schemes to give a stronger push for industrial facilities, including those of small and medium-sized enterprises, to be more energy-efficient. In the long term, to achieve our mitigation aspirations, we will pursue three key strategies. First, we will transform our industry, economy and society to adopt more renewable energy, be more energy-efficient and reduce energy consumption. Second, we will invest in and draw on low-carbon technologies, such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage and low-carbon hydrogen. Third, we will foster international collaboration in areas, such as well-functioning carbon markets and regional electricity grids. We will continue to raise our ambitions over time, despite our constraints as a small city-state with limited alternative energy resources. How soon we can achieve net-zero emissions will depend on factors, such as global advancement in low-carbon technologies. We are strengthening international partnerships to expand our options to reduce emissions."
"Sir, I thank Ms Poh for her supplementary questions. First, to clarify, AMAP is currently still doing its review. It has not come to any landing point at this moment. It is studying carefully the different options and trade-offs. What I shared earlier in my main reply was to highlight some of the practices in overseas jurisdictions where they do not license cyclists or bicycles, but they have other ways of improving road safety. So, we do need to look at these carefully. I believe where Ms Poh and some members of the public are coming from is that licensing may seem like an attractive idea to improve road safety, but, in practice, and based on the experiences in other countries, whether that is, indeed, an effective way or are there other more effective ways, that is something AMAP is carefully studying. Sir, I agree with Ms Poh that while we look at how to expand our cycling paths, our Park Connectors, in the meantime, there are also other ways to improve the infrastructure, to improve road safety in our towns for all users. Just to give an example, in Toa Payoh, where I am looking after the town, we are working together with LTA, PUB and also the other agencies to cover up some of the open drains and convert them into wider footpaths. And in doing so, as Ms Poh pointed out, there will be more space for different groups of road users  pedestrians, cyclists. This is an important effort that must be complemented by users putting safety as a priority. The footpaths may be wider, but you must still ride safely and you must still look out for bicycles, other devices and other pedestrians when you are walking along these footpaths. At the end of the day, I think what is most important is a combination of good infrastructure but also safety consciousness, placing priority on safety for all users."
"The Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) licenses and registers all food importers and is able to impose import requirements on them. In addition to requiring each food consignment from Japan to be accompanied by a certificate of origin, stating which prefecture the food originates from, the food packaging also needs to be labelled with information, such as country of origin of food and contact information of the local importer. This is to ensure that the food products in the market are correctly labelled. To date, AVA’s active surveillance has not detected any case of Fukushima food products being mislabelled or repackaged and sold under other local brand names in Singapore. AVA continues to test foods from Japan. Since January 2013, AVA has not detected any radioactive contamination in food samples from Japan. Hence it is not necessary to carry out a research on the health effects of Fukushima food products on local consumers. Singapore does not tolerate any radioactive contaminants in food."
"We have about 12,800 nursing home beds as at end-December 2016. Of these, about 11,000 beds are subsidised. Between 2012 and 2016, the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) received an average of 3,400 applications for subsidised nursing home beds per year. The waiting time depends on several factors such as care needs of patients, family preferences and available capacity. On average, successful applicants wait about four months for a subsidised nursing home bed. Very few nursing home residents are ambulant. This is because in assessing the needs of applicants, AIC generally prioritises nursing home placements for patients who require help and supervision in three or more activities of daily living such as feeding and toileting, and have weak family support. For seniors who are ambulant and can be supported in the community, AIC refers them for home-based and community services instead. We are strengthening these services to enable more seniors to age in place, rather than be cared for in a nursing home. In 2016, more than 6,000 seniors were placed in home care and/or day care."
"The Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) was launched in 2001 to provide direct lift access to flats and enhance convenience for residents, especially the elderly and the less mobile. At the start of the programme, there were more than 5,300 HDB blocks without 100% lift access. Over the years, HDB has adopted innovative technical solutions, such as lifts that do not have a machine room at the top of the shafts, and small capacity lifts, to help such blocks to have direct lift access. Through these efforts, the vast majority of the 5,300 blocks are now able to benefit from LUP. There now remain about 150 blocks where it is still not possible to implement LUP due to high cost, or existing technical or site constraints. With regard to the suggestion to create sky bridges to connect flats without direct lift access to the nearest lift, we will need to study this carefully. Such sky bridges will require extensive structural works, which is likely to be very expensive. Meanwhile, we continue to look for cost effective technical solutions for flats without direct lift access. Residents who are in urgent need of direct lift access due to medical conditions or disability may approach HDB for assistance. HDB will look into the specific circumstances of each case, and see how best to render help."
"The Agri-food Cluster Transformation Fund provides co-funding support for capital investments by our local farms to improve productivity, sustainability and resource efficiency. Investments by farms for commonly-consumed food items are co-funded at 70%, while those for other food items are co-funded at 50%. Since its launch on 30 April 2021, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has received a total of 23 applications as of 31 December 2021. Eight applications have been approved with grant amounts ranging between $10,000 and $700,000 while the remaining applications are being evaluated by SFA."
"The Police Licensing and Regulatory Department requires any person who provides CCTV installation or maintenance as a service to have a Security Service Provider licence under the Private Security Industry Act. These licensees must undergo security screening to ensure they are fit and proper persons to provide security services. In addition, under the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), organisations are required to notify individuals of the purpose and obtain their consent to collect, use or disclose their personal data, including those captured by CCTV recordings. Also, organisations are required to protect personal data in their possession or control by making reasonable security arrangements. The Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) has issued advisory guidelines to help organisations deploying CCTVs comply with the PDPA. The advisory guidelines provide examples of good practices, such as placing notices at points of entry to a building or prominent locations in a venue, where individuals are able to read the notices prior to the collection of their personal data by CCTVs. Organisations that install CCTVs but fail to notify or obtain consent from an individual for the collection of his/her personal data, or fail to protect such personal data, are liable for breaching the PDPA. The PDPC will investigate and take enforcement action for breaches, which include issuing directions and imposing financial penalties."
"It is unsettling to see acts of terror still happening all over the world. Although the incidents have happened in other countries, Singaporeans are acutely aware that the same tragedy can happen on our soil. It is worrying when we also hear reports of the arrests and detention of radicalised Singaporeans who could have potentially caused harm at home. In this regard, I would like to ask the Ministry to give an update on the current level of threat. What is the current level of threat of terrorism on the international, regional and domestic fronts? I trust the Ministry and the Home Team are taking all efforts to ensure that our country is prepared to deflect and respond to any potential attacks. I believe it would be good to assure Singaporeans of the counter-terrorism efforts in place to protect Singaporeans. Could the Ministry provide an update on what has been done to build the Home Team's capabilities? Aside from the Home Team, it is important that the community stays vigilant and is also equipped with the necessary preparedness. To this end, SGSecure has been an excellent effort in creating awareness and building the skills of members of the community in response to a terror attack. I would like to seek an update on the efforts of implementing SGSecure on the ground. Are there means to measure the level of awareness and preparedness of the community? What more can be done to equip our community with the necessary skills and protect them against any attacks?"
"Mr Speaker, the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) was set up in April 2017, slightly under a year ago, and its purpose was to help employees and employers manage and resolve employment disputes. This includes both salary and non-salary-related disputes. A large majority of the disputes received by TADM are salary-related disputes which are governed under the Employment Claims Act (ECA), where mediation is compulsory. For non-salary disputes, voluntary mediation is offered. Between April and December 2017, TADM concluded mediation for 6,000 salary-related claims under the ECA. About 95% of these claims were filed by employees, and the remaining by employers for notice pay. Seventy-nine percent of these 6,000 claims were settled amicably through mediation. Twelve percent were not settled as parties were unable to work out a settlement. These cases were then referred to the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT) for adjudication. The remaining 9% were claims involving non-attendance at mediation. In other words, someone did not show up. One-third of the non-attendance cases were closed as the claimants themselves did not show up. For the remaining two-thirds, when respondents did not attend mediation, claimants could have their claims heard and adjudicated by the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT), even if respondents do not turn up for the hearing. Where there are good grounds, the ECT can and will make a payment order in favour of claimants, for the full claimed amount. As a consequence of non-attendance, the ECT may also order the respondents to pay costs to the claimants. To date, TADM and the tribunal have helped about 92% of employees with valid salary claims recover their salaries in full. Most of the remaining employees received some form of partial payment."
"Our schools provide a range of CCA, that is, clubs and societies, physical sports, uniformed groups, and visual and performing arts, to provide holistic education and cater to diverse student interests. Beyond school teams, students keen to participate in Physical Sports CCA may join recreational or development teams. Most students are allocated one of their CCA choices. Some popular CCA may not be able to accommodate all interested students due to constraints with facilities, coaches or scheduling. To support interested students beyond CCA, schools also offer Sports Education Programmes where students can take up sports programme as an enrichment."
"The Singapore Citizenship Journey (SCJ) is a mandatory programme that helps new citizens learn about Singapore's multi-cultural society, values and norms; facilitates their involvement in the community; and welcomes them into the Singaporean family. The SCJ consists of an online module, an experiential learning programme that brings participants to significant historical landmarks and national institutions and a Community Sharing Session. The SCJ covers Singapore's history and policies, key institutions such as our parliamentary system and rule of law, and highlights the responsibilities of citizenship. Through the Community Sharing Session, local community leaders share with new citizens their experiences of living in a multi-racial and multi-religious society and encourage them to be involved in the community. The content of the SCJ is determined by two main criteria. First, does the content help new citizens to better understand and adapt to the Singaporean way of life? Second, does the content help them relate better to fellow citizens? Hence, the SCJ focuses on Singapore's history and institutions, social norms and community relations as the foundational content. We are continuously updating and fine-tuning the SCJ content to ensure that it achieves its objectives."
"Sir, I would like to point out that the Workers' Party opposed the Public Order Act and with respect to Mr Xie's specific points on part E of the Public Order Act, yes, it is. But the Public Order Act does not have clause 7F – to prevent any foreign interference directed towards a political end in Singapore. Clause 7F leads on into clause 8, where it defines the political end in Singapore. So, I think it is important for us to understand that we want to scope down the Bill to make sure that we focus on the acts that actually cause harm to Singapore, not provide a catch-all phrase inside the Bill for the Minister, if he cannot find anything else to use, to use that as a tool against harm. There are specific qualifications for what qualifies as harm against public interest, against public health and so on. I have given examples on how, let us say, if there is a threat to public health, the Minister can take action on that. There is nothing preventing him in this Bill from taking action and the Bill has many other strong clauses to give the Minister the power to be able to take action. So, nothing is preventing him from doing that just because (f) and (g) are removed."
"Mr Speaker, I wish to thank Minister Ong for the very detailed answer to our colleagues' questions and my questions as well. I have three clarifications that I wish to seek from Minister. First of all, I do understand the recovery and risk trade-off that Minister mentioned. I think we all mindful of it, especially with the incidence risk that comes along with opening up the country. My first question is, the Minister mentioned about the testing technology improving and there are plans for Air Travel Bubbles, ATBs. My first question is regarding bilateral and regional arrangements with ASEAN, for example. Can the Minister share with us how are the deliberations in the plans going ahead or the task force's deliberations with ASEAN for example, in opening up our regional air travel between ASEAN countries going forward, as testing technology improves? The second question, Minister mentioned about the logistics and cargo volume that has improved two times – I think if I am not mistaken, I heard two times, it has ramped up two times. My question is in the interim, as we see more Scoot planes on the tarmac, as we drive past Changi, PIE and towards the end, we see Scoot planes there – is there is a possibility of ramping up our logistics and cargo volume even further, in the interim. Particularly, because you probably might want to get the core capabilities of our aviation sector built up in the interim, as we as we wait for some of these technologies to improve or for ATBs or arrangements with other countries. My third question is in relation to my Parliamentary Question, in post-COVID, what are our plans for the medium and longer terms. Whether the Minister can share with us any infrastructure, strategies or plans to put us in a good stead post-COVID – I am not sure whether COVID-19 will end next year – beyond one year, two years or three, four, five years. How Singapore can take this opportunity to put us in a better stead beyond one year ahead?"
"Mdm Chair, two new hawker centres were completed since the Government resumed the building of hawker centres. They were Hougang Ci Yuan Hawker Centre operated by Fei Siong Food Management and Bukit Panjang Hawker Centre run by NTUC Foodfare. These two hawker centres were run under the new ""not-for-profit"" model. Can the Minister update how has the experience been and whether there are good learning points to apply for the next 18 new hawker centres. Building the hawker centres are the relatively easy part. The more difficult challenge is to find sufficient enterprising hawkers, especially the young hawkers. It is important that we groom a new generation of hawkers so that our hawker culture and the good food can carry on. Would NEA consider further lowering the barrier to entry for young would-be hawkers and have a new hawker assistance scheme or programme to help first-time hawkers. To keep our hawker centres vibrant and lively, would NEA consider studying overseas models and experiences such as those at the Taipei night markets and Hong Kong street markets to see if there are any good ideas that can be replicated in Singapore?"
"The 25% debt service ratio formula expressed in our manifesto in 2020 is a maximum cap. It is a maximum cap. It is not an expression of a target for the average. It is a maximum cap. Our formulation also has other elements in it, which differ from typical transactions right now – a 20-year loan tenure, 10% downpayment and additional subsidies for 2- and 3-room flats to lower the eventual BTO selling price even more. So, yes, it applies to all flats – that position in the manifesto, but it is a maximum cap."
"Singapore adopts a whole-of-society, multi-pronged approach to address the complex nature of suicide. The Government and community partners work together to promote upstream prevention, encourage individuals to seek help, provide support to at-risk groups, and offer crisis support. Many of these efforts need to take place in person to be effective, while some are complemented by online efforts. For example, the Institute of Mental Health (IMH)'s Community Health Assessment Team (CHAT) has a drop-in centre at *SCAPE Youth Park and an online WebCHAT service for young persons in need of mental health support. The National Council of Social Service (NCSS) is running a multi-year public education campaign on mental health issues, called 'Beyond the Label'. Apart from making available information on where to seek help, a Facebook community page has also been set up as a safe space for the online community to share experiences and provide support to those in recovery. A key community partner is the Samaritans of Singapore or SOS, which provides programmes to train professionals and the public on how to identify suicide warning signs, which may be observed on social media, and on how to support the individual. The evidence for ""suicide watch"" interventions, which depend on the robustness of the computer algorithms, is currently unclear. There may also be concerns about data privacy and civil liberties, as automated actions may kick in once warning signs are picked up, regardless of whether the distress is real or inaccurately diagnosed. We will continue to review how we enhance our suicide prevention efforts in both physical and online spaces."
"MCCY leads an inter-agency committee that regularly reviews the Community Dispute Management Framework or CDMF that Mr Yip has referred to, to update and improve measures, such as the referral protocol amongst frontline agencies, mediation and, of course, also legislative recourse. Our guiding principles continue to be to strengthen neighbourliness to minimise disputes upstream as far as possible; encourage mediation between neighbours to mend relations as far as possible; and, finally, as a measure of last resort, legal recourse for cases which may be intransigent. Mr Yip and other Members are welcome to share their views and feedback with us and the inter-agency committee on how this framework can be strengthened."
"Mdm Chair, many studies have suggested that young children of school-going age ought to get adequate rest every day. To do so, they should not have to wake up very early in the morning and then make their way to school which may be 30-45 mins away from home. Our current Primary school registration system does not give priority purely based on proximity to schools. Several other factors are considered like whether the sibling is at the same school, whether the parent is a former student or alumni from that school or whether the parents are linked to the school through a religious order, clan association or community leader. I acknowledge the importance of each factor in wanting schools to have links to former students and to develop a school culture. These are important factors. However, whatever reason a parent has for wanting a child to attend a particular Primary school, it simply does not make sense for young six or seven year old students to have to travel more than 20 mins to attend their school. I urge MOE to review the current Primary school priority system. We should discourage parents living more than 5 km away from the school from sending their child to the school and give greater priority to students living near the school. This way, the students benefit from having more time to sleep and not having to wake up at some unearthly hour."
"Sir, on the first point about creativity in a container, I just want to clarify one point. I think in his speech, Mr Kok gave the impression that with co-classification, it will stifle creativity. Actually, that is not the intent. It is really to allow some distributors to co-classify. But it means that you can also make a film for any of the classification rating that is available out there. The example that I gave and the example that Mr Ganesh Rajaram gave are good examples to demonstrate that film makers can actually make a film from R21 all the way downwards to G, if they want to do so. It is, basically, their choice. So, I do not think this co-classification scheme that we will introduce after the Act is amended will stifle the creativity of film makers. If anything, from the distributors' point of view, it is a lot more efficient for them to bring their films to the market. But I agree with the hon Member that creativity is important because we want to continue to build our films industry to be dynamic. On the Member's second point, as mentioned in my reply, the process that we will adopt will follow all other Ministerial appeal processes. Most of the processes, if not all, we will basically deal with the agencies and for the agencies who are involved to give us their submissions. So, I think we will retain that for the moment and we allow it to work out and see how it works and then we will evolve from there and learn from the experience."
"Currently, Singapore does not allow entry of short-term visitors from the United States of America (USA) unless they are (a) immediate family members or relatives of a Singapore Citizen or a Singapore Permanent Resident (PR), (b) spouses-to-be of a Singapore Citizen or Singapore PR, or (c) non-residents who have extenuating or compassionate reasons to enter Singapore. Travellers from the USA who are entering Singapore must serve a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at SHN Dedicated Facilities. Like all travellers who serve SHN, they are required to undertake a COVID-19 swab test before the end of the SHN period. The prevailing advisory is for Singaporeans to defer all non-essential travel to the USA. As of now, we have yet to begin negotiations of a green lane or special travel arrangements with the USA."
"The Reserve Price for sites sold under the Government Land Sales (GLS) and Industrial GLS programmes is pegged to 85% of the estimated market value of each site, as assessed by the Chief Valuer’s Office (CVO), taking into account proposed land use and site-specific conditions, relevant land sale transactions as well as rental and sale transactions of completed buildings. The Reserve Price serves as an internal guide to assess if tender bids are reflective of the fair market value of the land being put up for sale. Bids below the Reserve Price are not automatically ruled out; whether a site is awarded depends on the prevailing market conditions, number of independent bids received and the specific circumstances of each site. Of the 133 sites launched for tender between 2016 and 2021, 17 were not awarded as the highest bids were deemed not reflective of the fair market value of the land. Of the sites that were awarded, the majority were within 15% of CVO’s estimated market value."
"Flats under the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS) have various site expiry dates. Out of the current stock of 1,430 PPHS flats  a) 900 (63%) are HDB flats such as unsold flats and public rental flats, which generally have longer and more flexible tenures of more than three years and can be used for PPHS as long as they are not required for more urgent uses; and b)	450 (31%) are vacated Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) flats and 80 (6%) are polytechnic apartments, which generally have shorter tenures of around two to three years, and must be returned when the sites are needed for redevelopment or when the leases are up. The breakdown of PPHS flats from various sources in each of the past five years is shown in Table 1."
"Mr Chairman, over the past one year, many of us have seen our screen-time increase by leaps and bounds. My friends in the stockbroking industry tell me that after years of decline, their commissions have gone up. Data has shown that there have been more trades done, although in small amounts. And we all know that shopping online is prevalent these days. Life has indeed changed and the digital world is occupying more of our waking hours. How has digitalisation allowed us to ease into the new reality of life during COVID-19? I would like to also ask what investments the Government is making in terms of infrastructure, not just to enable the expansion of our digital universe but to keep it safe from scams and fair from all points of view."
"Student Care Centres (SCCs) provide before- and after-school care for children aged 7 to 14 years. SCCs that administer the Student Care Fees Assistance are registered with the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF). Today, there are 409 SCCs registered with MSF, of which 329 operate outside of school premises. The number of such centres ranged from 307 to 373 over the last five years. MSF does not have the breakdown of the reasons behind centres’ decisions not to re-register to administer the Student Care Fees Assistance."
"Monies collected from the Skills Development Levy (SDL) are placed into the Skills Development Fund (SDF). Funds from the SDF are used to support workforce upgrading and to provide training grants to employers when they send their employees for training. In the latest financial year FY2012, approximately $210 million in SDL was collected. A total of $171 million was committed for both training subsidies and CET infrastructure development. Of the $171 million, $67 million was given directly to employers in the form of course fee subsidies and absentee payroll, with 43% ($29 million) received by SMEs. Of the $29 million, $7 million went to sponsoring SMEs with 10 employees or fewer. SMEs form the backbone of our economy. As we restructure our economy to achieve productivity driven growth, we are also investing heavily in helping SMEs to upgrade the skills of their workforce. Since 2012, we have increased the funding for SMEs, providing 90% course fee subsidies and higher absentee payroll to encourage SMEs to send their employees for training. This was based on feedback from SMEs and industry associations who identified training and upgrading as a key area where they hoped to receive more Government support. As we continue to enhance our CET offerings, we would like to take this opportunity to encourage all enterprises to actively tap on our CET programmes to improve the skills and productivity of their workforce."
"Madam, as I have mentioned in my reply, the public can come to the Archives and make a request for the materials that they would like to see. As the Member mentioned, after 25 years, they will become public archives and that is why they are open to the public. No archive in the world gives you free access to every material that they have, even if they are unclassified. After we have looked through the materials and if the materials are really non-sensitive, then we can release them. At the same time, every material that is being requested will have to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis because there are concerns – national security, national defence. These concerns are not only shared by our Archives, but with the archives around the world, including in the US. Let us not pretend that when we have such an Act, everything can be released because there are concerns which every nation has to preserve, whether it relates to defence, security and even about diplomatic relations. We have to preserve that. As we ensure that we can meet those requirements that I have mentioned, we will release the materials as much as possible, depending on the needs of the public. At the same time, where the materials are non-sensitive, we have released them online and made them available. The materials that have been used by our broadcasters to produce PSB programmes, for example, the public can go to the Archives and make a request. We will make them available because, if they have been used for the broadcasts, they must be made available to the public because the materials are non-sensitive."
"Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) is a common childhood illness that is usually mild. Most children recover from HFMD on their own without treatment. As HFMD infections are not reportable and the majority are mild, MOH does not track the number or percentage of children who have contracted HFMD at least once during their life. The key to controlling the spread of HFMD is to maintain high standards of personal and environmental hygiene, and to seek medical treatment early when the child is unwell. MOH works closely with the Ministry of Education (MOE), Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) and People's Association (PA) to ensure that educational institutions, including childcare centres, remain vigilant and take measures to minimise the spread of infectious diseases. Parents should also ensure that their children with HFMD remain at home for the duration of the illness as advised by the doctors, to prevent spread to others."
"Thank you, Mr Chairman. Earlier in my speech, I asked whether there are assessments by HDB for applicants of Joint Singles Scheme (JSS) to ensure that they are free from mental illnesses and medical conditions before compelling them to stay together. May I ask Minister Wong whether he will look into the JSS for those who have no family members to share with. Because I also noticed that HDB always gives applicants a list of names for them to call themselves to choose their own tenants to share with. And that is really very difficult. So, as Minister Wong earlier said, we have been improving our HDB policies to facilitate Singaporeans in their housing needs. JSS has been around for the last 30 years. So, why can we not tweak this to facilitate just the most vulnerable group in our society? Would he consider?"
"Mr Speaker, I should clarify. I think Mr Louis Ng is mistaken. We do have surveys of income other than work in the household expenditure survey. It is not part of the Gini coefficient computation. So, that income is covered in the household expenditure survey which is done once every five years. As I have said just now, collecting data on income other than work is always fraught with issues, not just for us but for other countries as well. But we are continuing to see how the data can be better captured."
"Inmates in the prison or drug rehabilitation centre, generally, have at least an hour of recreational time per day on weekdays. They can use this recreational time for physical exercise and ball games in the recreational yard, or other activities, such as watching television and playing board games. In the cells, inmates are allowed to do stretching exercises, but not vigorous exercise. And that is not allowed for the following reasons. First, to prevent tension and conflict among cellmates. The majority of prison cells are designed to house up to four or eight inmates each, and there is insufficient space for inmates to carry out vigorous exercise without affecting the safety of cellmates, inconveniencing them, or intruding into their personal space. Doing so could lead to conflict among the cellmates. To ensure equal treatment, we do not allow vigorous in-cell exercise even if the cell is occupied by only one inmate. Second, to maintain good order and discipline in prison. Some inmates may claim to be exercising in their cell when shadow-boxing or sparring, or giving tips and teaching others how to fight and attack opponents. This would pose challenges to maintaining good order and discipline in prison."
"NParks adopts a science-based approach to manage the population of wildlife in Singapore, including wild boars and monkeys. This includes conducting population studies and research to better understand the distribution of these species. For example, NParks carries out tracking studies to monitor changes in the wild boar population and to identify hotspots. Based on its findings, the wild boar population in our nature reserves has remained relatively constant. NParks is also conducting a study to analyse the population trends of long-tailed macaques. NParks' studies inform its measures to manage the population of wild boars and monkeys. For example, to reduce the availability of food sources at wild boar hotspots, NParks carries out habitat modification, such as removing oil palms. NParks also works with public agencies and developers to erect hoardings to prevent wildlife like wild boars from straying into nearby residential areas. To safeguard public safety, NParks carries out population control measures where needed. NParks also works closely with stakeholders on public education and outreach, to promote human-wildlife co-existence. A key area is to discourage the feeding of wildlife. Intentional feeding or irresponsibly discarding food waste can alter the natural foraging behaviour of wildlife and lead them to rely on humans for food. NParks also works closely with other public agencies, grassroots organisations and Town Councils to engage the community on proper refuse management and to deter illegal wildlife feeding. In addition, NParks works with these stakeholders to develop educational resources and to advise the community on how to respond to wildlife sightings. All of us need to play our part to live in harmony with wildlife. We can do this by not feeding wildlife, keeping our residential areas clean and appreciating wildlife from a safe distance."
"I want to assure Ms Nadia Samdin that it is not because there is a sudden, urgent need to have lawyers qualify quickly and therefore, we deferred the programme, which is from a six-month training period to a one-year training period. The reason for that is, as I explained in my speech, we have had COVID-19 for the past two and a half years or so. I think as we begin to open up, the firm processes for working from home and arrangements with the supervision of their trainees have been re-adjusted. So, we thought, given feedback from the firms, that it is better to let these practices settle because the way in which trainees work in the firms, how they interact with their seniors, with their mentors, with the senior lawyers, is going to be a key part of that training and a key part of that expansion of the one year. We wanted to let these new post-COVID-19 work processes settle before we implement the changes. As to when it will come onstream, it will be shortly – certainly, ahead of time and in good time for the trainees to be kept informed of the timeline and the arrangements. But really, there is no change in the regime at all. It is what the Committee for the Professional Training of Lawyers (CPTL) had recommended in terms of why one year and what that one year ought to comprise. It is just that the process will now kickstart in 2024 instead of 2023."
"The Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme was introduced in 2007 to supplement the wages and CPF savings of low-income workers, as well as to encourage them to work regularly. Employees receive WIS in cash and in their CPF accounts in the ratio of 1 2.5. Self-employed persons receive WIS entirely in their CPF Medisave account. The number of WIS recipients and the total amount of WIS due to them for work done from 2007 to 2011   WIS targets full-time income earners in the bottom 20% but benefits are extended (at reducing rates) to cover earners up to around the 30th percentile. In 2010, WIS was enhanced, with both its payout quantum and income cap increased. In 2012, the payment frequency to employees was increased from twice to four times a year. MOM will review WIS in 2013. In reviewing WIS, we will take into account changes in income levels and inflation, bearing in mind that the level of assistance should be meaningful yet continue to encourage individual effort and responsibility. It is also important to continue striking an appropriate balance between giving recipients cash to help with their immediate needs and CPF to help with their retirement adequacy. WIS is a permanent social transfer mechanism. Ensuring it is structured to be effective while fiscally sustainable, and targeted at those who need it most are, therefore, also important considerations. In helping low-income workers, a holistic approach is adopted. WIS is an important component but only one of several schemes aimed at helping the individuals and their families. ComCare and Medifund, for example, play critical roles in supporting this group of Singaporeans as well."
"Seniors Go Digital was launched in May last year to help our seniors build digital capabilities. At the parliamentary debate last June, I stated my support for it, but was concerned about seniors who might not be able to make the digital leap. The Minister clarified that the idea was to encourage the adoption of digital solutions, but to keep open the option of using non-digital solutions because there would be some who would still prefer them, or are uncomfortable with the digital part. He also highlighted that cybersecurity was something that would continue to be emphasised in the training programmes with seniors. Since then, this programme has gained momentum. It was reported that the programme aimed to reach out to 100,000 seniors by this month. There had been roll-outs of low cost mobile phone plans for seniors through a scheme called Mobile Access for Seniors, aimed at the low-income. To understand the impact of these schemes, could the Ministry clarify the following three aspects? First, what is the kind of reach that IMDA wants to achieve with the targeted 100,000 seniors? Is the KPI geared at the numbers who attend the courses? Or must a certain level of competency be demonstrated? Second, what is the expected number to benefit from the Mobile Access for Seniors scheme? And third, given the escalation of online scams, will the crime prevention aspects of the training be amplified?"
"I thank the Minister for the answer. Just two supplementary questions. Firstly, from my knowledge of the CSP, I think there is still quite a number of SMEs as well as HR and employers in those SMEs who are not aware of the CSP. Just two suggestions. Firstly, can MOM strengthen its outreach, particularly for all SMEs in Singapore, through various collaterals where MOM or other public agencies interface with these SMEs? Secondly, will the Ministry consider, instead of having the employers tap on the CSP prior to hiring the person or before they are allowed to claim the funding, whether it can be made automatic, in the sense that you can detect whether they do hire people who are earning $3,600 and above, and who are above or under 40, and who are unemployed and retrenched?"
"Thank you very much. Thank you very much for accepting that you have full respect for the AGO's professional work. I have similar respect for my AGO's work. And if that is so, then we take the AGO report as what it is. And I would like to repeat this  there is a material difference to what it means by a set of qualified accounts and what it means not to have that qualification. I think we are very clear in our mind whether the PA accounts were qualified or not. You can check that. I suggest you invite Mr Chen Show Mao, who is sitting beside you, who is well versed in this, to clarify what is the difference between a set of qualified accounts and otherwise."
"In terms of the number of day-care places, I think the Member asked earlier about wait-time and ratios. For day-care places, the estimated wait-time was about 20 days in 2014. This is a significant improvement from 2013, which was about 30-odd days. As I have said in my speech, we are ramping up capacity very rapidly. Over the last four years, we have increased the number of day-care places by 1,000 and we are on track to increase the number of day-care places to 6,200 by 2020. Whilst they are waiting for day-care places, the hospitals could assist in terms of referring them for interim caregiver service or transitional care service. In order to further ramp up capacity, as I have said, we are also ramping up homecare. So, an alternative really would be homecare services. With regards to palliative care, actually, Minister Gan did announce about MOH's plan last year to develop the palliative care sector in a holistic and comprehensive manner and it is in four areas. In terms of quality, there is a palliative care guideline which we are finalising and it will be used as a developmental guideline and to improve and enhance service. And also in terms of capacity, we are expanding capacity both in home palliative care as well as inpatient palliative care beds. In terms of affordability, we further expanded the use of Medisave for palliative care to reduce the patients' cash payment upfront. So, withdrawal limits have been increased and lifetime limits for terminal cancer or end-stage organ failure have been removed for home palliative care. Where it is the family members who pay, the life time limit has been increased. Of course, we are also looking into increasing public awareness in terms of helping the public to understand end of life issues, advanced care planning, palliative care and so on."
"Depending on the facts of the case, scammers can be charged for one of the cheating-related offences under Sections 417 to 420 of the Penal Code, which carry maximum imprisonment terms of between 3 and 10 years. MHA’s assessment is that the penalties are adequate. The main challenge in combating scams is that most of the scammers are based overseas. We have been actively collaborating with foreign law enforcement agencies. MHA has also stepped up efforts on scam prevention through education and public awareness. We have also enhanced collaboration with industry partners such as telcos, online marketplaces, banks and remittance companies, to detect and stop scams before they happen."
"I thank the Member for the supplementary question. As the Member has rightly noted, social egg freezing is currently disallowed in Singapore and there are various reasons for this. Whilst the medical risks can be addressed through regulation as well as enhanced public education and counselling of potential users, there are social and ethical implications that have to be considered carefully. Couples may delay marriage and parenthood thinking that egg freezing would assure them that they can have a child later on in life when they wish to conceive. Age-related fertility issues actually affect both men and women. The best way to ensure having a healthy child, really, is when couples are relatively young and healthy. Nonetheless, we note the feedback that we have received. We are currently carefully considering the implications of allowing social egg freezing. We are monitoring international developments in the field of social egg freezing. We will review our position, taking into account the experiences of countries that have implemented this, as well as of course the proper safeguards that we need − the regulatory framework, for instance − to ensure or safeguard patients' safety should social egg freezing be allowed, as well as social and medical implications, and the prevailing societal norms and culture."
"MOE regularly reviews the number of primary and secondary schools nationally and by residential areas to ensure that there are sufficient school places There are five primary schools within one kilometre and another 11 primary schools within one to two kilometres of Fernvale. Posting of secondary school students is based on merit, and MOE plans for secondary schools at a broader, regional level. There are currently more than 20 secondary schools in the north-eastern part of Singapore where Fernvale is. In our planning for building of new schools, whether for primary or secondary schools, we will need to do a careful study of the medium to longer-term demand for places and our plans for existing schools in the area. When we have made a firm decision to build a new school, we will provide sufficient advance notice to the public on the likely timeline for the opening of the new school."
"With the implementation of MediShield Life for all Singaporeans, we have streamlined our processes so that Singapore Citizens who choose Class B2 or C wards will not need to pay deposits. There is an exception of a small number of patients, who will need to pay a deposit if they choose Class B2 against financial counselling advice so as to encourage them to choose the class they can better afford. The public hospitals will also advise patients who need help with their healthcare bills and discuss with them options for assistance. For private patients who choose private hospitals or Class A or B1 wards in the public hospitals, their bills are much higher as they do not enjoy the heavy subsidy for B2/C wards. Thus, hospitals may require them to make upfront payment, such as a deposit pre-admission, to cover their estimated hospitalisation cost. Once the bill and the insurance payout is finalised, they will be reimbursed for any excess payments. Even if the patient has private insurance, hospitals have no certainty over the patient’s insurance payout, given the range of private insurance policies with different coverage, terms and exclusions for pre-existing conditions. Therefore, they may collect a deposit. However, hospitals may waive or reduce the deposit if the patient’s insurer issues an upfront Letter of Guarantee to cover all or part of the estimated bill. Today, all the six Integrated Shield Plan insurers issue Letters of Guarantee usually with coverage of up to $10,000, if the patient meets their criteria."
"MOM will define a core set of insurance terms and conditions to prevent unfair exclusion. Since we are encouraging older workers to remain employable, will MOM ensure that the insurance companies will provide coverage for all workers, regardless of age, as long as they are manual or non-manual employees earning up to $2,600? I think there should be no exclusion clauses, especially in fine print, to deny any age group because it will affect their employability. Can I have that assurance that all age groups will be covered?"
"Police investigations into the case have concluded. A 47-year-old man was found to have thrown a small Pride flag in the direction of staff of the SMOL restaurant at Lau Pa Sat and shouted at them for their display of the flag. Police did not recommend prosecution in consideration that no injuries were caused, the man had a medical history of mental disorder which may explain in part his actions in the case and the incident was not protracted. With the concurrence of the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC), Police have issued a 24-month conditional warning to the man for an offence of intentionally causing harassment, alarm or distress under section 3(2) of the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA). The Government’s position is clear  harassment and abuse of any person for any reason is not condoned. The law protects LGBTQ individuals the same as everyone else. For instance, POHA contains a range of both civil and criminal measures to protect all victims against offences involving harassment and abuse. Acts involving hurt or incitement of violence are criminalised under legislation such as the Penal Code. Amendments were also made to the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act (MRHA) in 2019 to make it an offence to urge violence on the grounds of religion or religious belief, against any person or group."
"Let me try to categorise Mr Gerald Giam's questions. I think to his first point in terms of whether COMPASS was from the FCF. COMPASS has actually taken into consideration the many months of data analytics, in terms of the hiring patterns, based on diversity, based on qualifications, salaries and also the concentration of PMETs within the firm, to come up with a fairly nuanced framework. The fact that the vast majority of the companies actually passed when we put them through the COMPASS framework is actually a testimony to the fact that many companies for the past many years have been very progressive, very responsive and very nimble to the needs of our economy. As far as the diversity itself is concerned, it is a function also of the ability of the company to access the skill sets based on the individual sector. So, let me put it across in a perhaps, in a more illustrative way. For those that are in IT, particularly when you deal with a lot of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and very advanced deep machine learning, even with deep-tech itself, depending on the sources where this group of skill sets are developed, you are not able to completely assume that you are able to get these skill sets from all around the world. Hence, we designed it to be such that in those areas that we have shortage of, and the fact that when we decided to pivot into the Industry 4.0 roadmap, we therefore needed to complement these gaps. So, when we took all these into account, we felt that this is what is needed for our economy to get to the next step. The exact details, going into the granularity of why we want to do the cut-off at the various benchmarks, I think I have already explained it before in my speech. I hope that sort of gives the Member some insights into the thinking behind it. What was your third point?"
"Sir, the importance to our country and to our economy of regional cooperation and trade; and the importance to our people and our enterprises of internationalisation and regionalisation have been much rehearsed in these COS proceedings for other Ministries. Could we complement these efforts and facilitate these outcomes with an increased focus on regional language proficiency in our school curricula? There are other good reasons, in many ways more important reasons, for doing so. First, education. Research has found several benefits of multi-lingual education in children, including cognitive and intellectual skills. UNESCO has consistently championed multi-lingual education in schools. Second, to protect and preserve our own multi-culturalism. We should promote the learning of our own national language and our other official languages. It promotes national integration, and it is our good fortune that our national language and other official languages happen to be among the most widely spoken in Asia and the world. We currently have third language programmes at the Secondary school level like MSP for learning Malay and CSP for Chinese; and we have conversational third language programmes for Malay and Chinese at the Primary school level as enrichment, but not as part of the regular curriculum. As learning languages is best done when young, could the Ministry look into making the conversational third language programme part of the syllabus to deepen the conversational language skills of our Primary school students, and we do this starting with our national language and our official languages, perhaps, included as part of the regular curriculum for every student, that is compulsory and during school hours, but without the pressure of examinations?"
"I have two supplementary questions for the Minister. The first is, I would like her to clarify whether the scheme target group remains the same. In other words, is it still targeted at the bottom 20% of elderly, with some support for those between 20% and 30%? Because lately, some of the collaterals, including replies that we have received from the agency, do not seem to mention this second group of those between the bottom 20% and 30%. So, I would like the Minister to clarify whether this group between the bottom 20% and 30% is still within the target of the scheme."
"Mr Speaker, I thank the Minister for the reply. It is very heartening to hear what Minister said, specifically that no Singaporean student will be displaced from a position in our AUs because of an international student. I just have two supplementary questions, Mr Speaker. First is a question to the Minister that when we decide on the international students to admit into our AUs, do we consider or look at a ratio or a good balance of which countries these international students come from? And if we do, is this ratio periodically reviewed? The second thing is when we determine which areas or field of study that we offer these international students places in our AUs for, would we also consider not only the needs of Singaporeans but whether or not the respective industries that these students could be graduating into are able to absorb these students into the workforce?"
"As our population ages, healthcare needs will increase and become more complex. We agree with the Member that we should continue to up-skill ENs and support care staff to perform a wider scope of patient care. ENs and support care staff can undergo in-house training provided by our public healthcare institutions. They can also attend courses offered by training providers, such as the SingHealth Alice Lee Institute of Advanced Nursing Studies and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC)'s Learning Institute. ENs can also up-skill to be RNs through the Diploma in Nursing course offered by Nanyang Polytechnic and Ngee Ann Polytechnic. As part of the recommendations by the National Nursing Taskforce in 2014, more ENs can progress to become RNs by undertaking the Certificate in Bridging Studies for ENs course, and subsequently the Diploma in Nursing course, if they have at least three years of post-enrolment work experience and an employer's testimonial. The MOH has also increased funding for our public healthcare institutions to support the upgrading of ENs to RNs. With these changes, the number of ENs enrolling in the Diploma in Nursing course increased by 7% from 237 in 2014, to 253 in 2016. We will continue to study ways to enhance the roles, professional growth and career pathways for our ENs and support care staff, so that we can continue to deliver good quality care for Singaporeans."
"Chairman, I have four supplementary questions. The first one on the Orchard Youth Belt which I believe Senior Minister of State Sim Ann said that Senior Parliamentary Secretary would mention. I am not so sure I caught that part of the answer. Will there be delays because of the current economic situation and what are the broad plans forward? In relation to sports, again to the Senior Parliamentary Secretary, yesterday there was quite a stark commentary on the state of sports in The New Paper, written by Leonard Thomas. I echo some of his concerns. I would like to ask what are the plans that SportSG and the Ministry have to increase attendance at sports events, especially for competitive sports, and to raise the support level overall, especially for our traditional sports? I also heard the Senior Parliamentary Secretary say earlier that Ministry and the SportSG does not interfere in the running of the NSAs. Leonard also mentioned in his article that, and I quote, ""I can't help but feel some undercurrent of distrust between NSAs and SportSG."" So, I would like to ask what is the type of oversight that SportSG has over the NSAs, especially over drafting of their constitutions, rules and regulations on elections and renewal of their management committees."
"Since the implementation of the Fair Consideration Framework, I wish to ask the Ministry of Manpower how successful have we been in the drive towards hiring and developing a strong Singaporean Core. Can MOM provide an update on their additional scrutiny efforts, engagement with ""double weak"" and ""triple weak"" companies and punitive actions on those on the ""red lane""? In particular, can MOM share whether ICT, Financial Sector and Professional services continue to be among the top few industries where most of the watch-list companies are and whether we will impose even more punitive sanctions against those recalcitrant companies? I also urge MOM to pay attention to employment agencies as anecdotally, I hear from fellow PMETs that they are culprits of ""hiring of their own kind"" practices."
"Both public and private housing prices have increased for three consecutive quarters since 2Q2020. Public housing prices rose by 5.0% in 2020, following the 0.1% increase in 2019. This could be due to the stronger demand for resale HDB flats, as seen by the 4% increase in the resale transaction volume in 2020, as compared with 2019. Private housing prices rose by 2.2% in 2020, following the 2.7% increase in 2019. The price increase for private housing in 2020 was observed for both landed and non-landed properties. This similarly reflected healthy demand for private housing amongst Singaporeans. Overall, the demand for housing was likely to have been supported by the current low interest rate environment. However, prospective homebuyers should carefully consider their ability to service their mortgage obligations over many years, and not be attracted by low interest rates in the short term. Given the negative impact on global economies and continuing labour market uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, prospective buyers should remain prudent in their property purchase and financing decisions. The Government will continue to monitor economic and property market conditions very closely, and will adjust its policies as necessary to maintain a stable and sustainable property market."
"It is not practical for MDA to extend its regulatory ambit to all public places which play songs as background music, such as retail outlets and shopping malls. Doing so would be burdensome and disproportionate to the risk involved. Even if rules were created to regulate such businesses, it would preferably be based on a co-regulatory model, which would still require businesses to exercise their own judgment based on a set of guidelines drawn up by MDA. Therefore, I would encourage retailers, shops and malls which play music within their premises to exercise common sense and social responsibility in their selection of music, and ensure that the songs played in their premises will not cause offence to their customers. In a recent case, a customer had noticed inappropriate music being played in fashion retail store, and spoken up against it. I am glad to note that, according to news reports, the retailer has acknowledged the mistake and apologised. This incident shows that the common sense and civic-mindedness of the public is important in highlighting such issues for their satisfactory resolution. We can all play a part in catching and preventing prejudice in our society. Public education and awareness have a larger role to play in such instances, than does regulation."
"Eligible employers can renew the work permits of foreign construction workers from around the last 56 days or eight weeks of a work permit’s validity. Upon receipt of a renewal notice by MOM, the employer can renew the work permit at any time before its expiry. If the work permit is not renewed, the employer is responsible to repatriate the worker when the permit is cancelled or expires. Foreign construction workers can transfer to a new employer any time during employment provided the current employer agrees. Between the 40th day and 21st day from expiry or the last 3 to 5 and a half weeks of the work permit, if the current employer has not already renewed, the worker can transfer to a new employer without the current employer’s agreement. This allows the worker to find new employment without having to leave Singapore. From the 20th day before expiry or the final three weeks of the work permit, as the current employer would already be making preparations to repatriate the worker and would have incurred additional costs, it would not be fair to allow for last-minute transfers without the current employer’s consent. Of the 168,900 work permits from the construction sector expiring between July and December 2020, 105,900 (63%) were renewed by the employers, with 96,200 renewed in the last 40 days of the work permit. This is mainly due to workers being unable to leave their dormitories during the lockdown last year to complete the renewal process. Another 34,500 (20%) were issued with a new work permit under another employer. Of the remaining, 28,500 (17%) were neither renewed nor re-issued with work permits, 7,900 (less than 5%) were cancelled in the last eight weeks of the work permit, while 5,100 (3%) expired. The others were mostly cancelled before the last eight weeks of the work permit."
"In 2020, Tencent announced plans to set up its regional hub for Southeast Asia in Singapore, while Alibaba and Bytedance took on additional commercial space to support their expansion. These recent investments were not awarded incentives by our economic agencies. These recent investments are projected to create at least 1,000 new PMET jobs over the next five years. Many of these jobs will be in both new and established roles Singaporeans are equipped for such as data science, data analysis and business development."
"Mr Speaker, the Government will continue to monitor a range of macroeconomic indicators. We look at our economic growth, for example. We look at inflation. We look at the impact of inflation on different groups. We look at real incomes, for example. And on real incomes, I think it is important to highlight it is not possible for the Government to fix nominal wages, to guarantee that real incomes will always be positive. We do not determine wages. But what we can do is continue to work hard on all the things we are doing to restructure, transform the economy, uplift productivity. Those efforts will pay off and will help us year by year to ensure that incomes rise and, hopefully, continue to rise faster than inflation. That must be our economic strategy. You cannot make this happen by fiat. You cannot dictate wages, but you can continue to press ahead with restructuring and transformation, which is what we are doing across all our economic agencies. On the point of how high should inflation have to be before we see more help, I think that is what Dr Lim Wee Kiak is asking. I am not able to give a specific trigger point now. As I have said, we will monitor a range of indicators. Not just the headline of economic growth, inflation, for that matter, unemployment, but also how it impacts different groups and different income groups, different occupations. And then, what is the impact of our current package of measures which has not been implemented? We need to see that properly implemented and feed through the economy as well. So, there are all these different considerations and that is why we cannot so simply distil it to just one key parameter. But the assurance that we continue to give is, we will monitor this very closely and, should there be a worsening of the situation externally and within Singapore, we will, certainly, stand ready to do more."
"Thank you, Chairman, two clarifications for Dr Koh. One, I am happy to hear of the exciting vision to ensure food security. Dr Koh mentioned a review on the land lease for agricultural land, would the Minister of State be able to share when this information will be made available and whether any criteria will be put in place for any longer leases? Secondly, for financial assistance, I mentioned in my speech, whether previous economic downturns have provided us with any lessons? I wonder if the schemes that Dr Koh had mentioned earlier are sufficient to prepare us for any future major downturns."
"Mdm Chair, one of the challenges faced by SMEs is finding local talent. It is common knowledge that companies need high quality staff to extend their businesses. Many SMEs want to employ local talents, but some locals prefer to work for MNCs, whether for prestige or better HR benefits. I would like to propose two ways to help our SMEs. Institutes of Higher Learning and Trade Associations have to work closely together to meet market needs. For example, many locals stay away from construction-related work. However, there are areas that pay well and need local talent. For example, quantity surveyors with three or more years of experience earn from $3,000 to $6,000. But our Polytechnics no longer conduct QS courses. The Building Construction Authority (BCA) conducts QS diploma courses with few local takers. One, can our ITEs fill this gap? Enhancing the skills and expertise of our local talent will allow us to rely on a larger and more stable workforce compared to a foreign, transient workforce. Two, can we also help with the marketing of SMEs by sectors, such as furniture, food, and construction industries? Help them with the brand imaging to make the industries more appealing. Poster boys and girls, inspirational stories, pride and mastery of skills, passion in doing a meaningful job − all these can help to build up the image of our important industries like construction and tourism."
"None Our choice is clear. By nature, we are hardworking people and that is a virtue. We will continue to work hard, we will do what is right for students, support as many of them as possible to do what they like and, love and be the best they can be. We also provide broad access to tertiary education. Today, seven in 10 of each Primary 1 cohort progress to publicly-funded degree or diploma programmes. Amongst students who live in 1-, 2- or 3-room HDB flats, more than half moved up to diploma or degree programmes. Our home ownership policies played a major part in social mobility too. HDB provides significant housing grants to help Singaporeans buy their homes – with the lower income getting more help than the higher income. So, in my constituency, we have many new BTOs. When I do my home visits, I meet many families who have moved out from their rental flats into a flat that they now own with great pride and often with the help of additional housing subsidies. With schemes such as Fresh Start and the Tenants’ Priority Scheme, I am sure more will follow the path of the 3,700 public rental households who have become homeowners in the last five years. But the success of our policies have led to a new set of issues. Families who did well are able to pass down the privileges to their children, through better coaching, enrichment classes and exposure to the world. Their children have a head start."
"As of March 2017, SPRING has approved eight LEAD+ projects, at up to $8.1 million in total funding. These projects are spearheaded by the Federation of Merchants' Associations, Singapore (FMAS), Singapore Food Manufacturers' Association (SFMA), Singapore Infocomm Technology Federation (SiTF), Singapore Logistics Association (SLA), Singapore Manufacturing Federation (SMF), Singapore Precision Engineering and Technology Association (SPETA), Singapore Furniture Industries Council (SFIC) and Restaurant Association of Singapore (RAS). We expect more TACs to be coming on board over the next few years. Under LEAD+, support is available for the secondment of public officers to TACs to help strengthen their management and processes as well as drive industry transformation. Efforts to second public officers to TACs are not new. Over the past five years, SPRING has been active in seconding officers to TACs on a project basis, to drive implementation of key programmes such as the SME Talent Programme and SMEs Centres. Under this arrangement, 13 officers have been seconded since 2013. Since the launch of LEAD+ in 2016, two more officers have confirmed their secondment with TACs. For example, one officer from SPRING has been seconded to SFMA to assist them in strengthening their internal management capabilities. This includes developing a succession plan for leadership renewal, putting in place systems to better engage and manage members, and enhancing the existing governance framework. We will continue to facilitate more of such win-win secondment arrangements for interested TACs."
"Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I have three questions for the Acting Minister. Earlier in his answer, he mentioned that the MAS is closely supervising SGX's efforts to build IT resilience. I would like to ask him a little bit more about what MAS is doing in that respect, and what are the options or levers open to MAS in its dealings with SGX, to either incentivise or to give some pressure to SGX to resolve this IT problem. My second question is, notwithstanding what the Acting Minister said about falling trading volumes worldwide, it was reported that from 2011 to 2015, the value of shares traded per day on SGX had fallen by a third over these last four years. I would like to ask the Acting Minister whether he thinks that is a cause for concern. My third question is I understand that some Singapore companies are choosing not to list themselves locally but are going to regional bourses to list. Has SGX or even the Government looked into the reasons why they do not find listing in Singapore attractive?"
"There have been a total of four complaints lodged this year at TAFEP against the property management firm of Hillview Heights. They relate to clauses in tender documents that discriminate against the age and language of security officers. For the first three complaints, TAFEP engaged the firm, which then took steps to rectify. Following the third complaint, TAFEP assessed that the occurrences were not isolated, and advised the firm to review their system. The fourth complaint, which arose from the tender for Hillview Heights, indicated that TAFEP’s advice had not been followed. TAFEP thus referred the case to MOM for further investigation which is ongoing. We would like to assure Ms Cheng Li Hui and also Mr Edward Chia, who has filed a similar question stemming from this incident, that MOM and TAFEP take a serious view of workplace discrimination, including the use of age as a selection criteria. Other than requiring employers to attend corrective workshops conducted by TAFEP, MOM will not hesitate to take enforcement actions against discriminatory employers, such as curtailing their work pass privileges. While we have not observed an increase in the number of workplace discrimination complaints received arising from this episode, we urge workers who face any form of workplace discrimination to approach TAFEP or MOM for assistance."
"Mr Speaker, Sir, let me deal with the supplementary questions in order. First, the scaling up of the education. The more interdisciplinary approach to the education system will not be just confined to the 500 students in the New College. Some of the best elements that we have been able to learn from these two traditions is that we will be able to scale this even to students beyond those that are going to be at the New College. So, yes, for a start, I think the Planning Committee is looking at 500 or a bit more for the New College, but there are elements of this that will actually percolate to the rest of the NUS ecosystem. That is the first one. Second, today, YNC takes in about 40% of its cohort from the international student community; NUS takes in about 10%. Going forward, for the initial planning parameters of the 500, what is the balance between the international and the local students will still have to be decided by the Planning Committee. I would look forward to NUS coming back to us on this. On the third issue about the admission policies for the next batch, yes, indeed, NUS is now making clear the offerings for the subsequent batch as early as possible so that they have the maximum time before they sign up for the different courses – for the next batch which will matriculate next year. On the fourth question, yes, NUS will definitely provide assistance to staff and faculty, as I have mentioned, for those who want to make alternative plans."
"Madam, cyber crimes and online scams have been on the rise and it is not surprising with majority of Singaporeans accessing the Internet every day across different platforms. According to the ""Annual Survey on Infocomm Usage in Households and by Individuals 2014"", 54% of our children aged between seven and 14 and 92% of our young aged 15 to 24 use portable infocomm equipment to connect to the Internet wirelessly. While they are tech savvy, they may or may not be Internet savvy. They are comfortable navigating the Internet, and may forget there are real dangers lurking in cyber space which they have to guard and protect themselves against. Cyber bullying, online predators and online scams are just some of the dangers youths face. Some people believe that it is the parents' duty to protect their children from online threats. While this may be true, it is difficult for parents to monitor and control the online behaviour of their children. Parents are often less tech savvy then their children. We have to equip our children and youths with the skills to navigate the Internet safely and to differentiate between fact and fiction, outdated news and incorrect sources. Hence, may I ask the Ministry for an update on the Cyber Wellness programs in our schools and whether it also includes Institutes of Higher Learning? Would the Ministry also share what other initiatives will be implemented to promote cyber safety?"
"I would like to thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the reply. I would like to ask, since we know that once the policy is changed and companies can drop the drug price by as much as 60%, is this not proof of profiteering? What actions are taken against this company for profiteering? My second supplementary question is on patients who have rare cancers and are requiring those drugs which are not on the list currently. Is there a mechanism for them to appeal for them to be added on to the ad hoc list? And what is the timeframe for that?"
"Mr Chairman, the fact that Singaporeans of various races live and interact with one another in harmony differentiates us from many other countries. Similar to three other Members who have shared on the EIP, the unintended economic consequences of EIP have been repeated frequently, including in this House. Minorities sometimes face or perceive difficulties in selling their HDB flats at their desired price, especially where they are prevented from selling to Chinese buyers who make up a large proportion of the market. I have also heard the same from my Malay and Indian residents. Is there room for us to refine EIP so that we do not economically disadvantage our minority residents while ensuring that we do not form significant ethnic enclaves? As we move to unite larger neighbourhoods with community hubs like Our Tampines Hub and Kampung Admiralty, is it possible to loosen the block-by-block quota and enforce a second-level ""cluster"" or ""district"" quota, while still maintaining the broad principles in EIP?"
"The Minimum Occupation Period (MOP) helps to ensure that flat owners purchase HDB flats with the intent of living in the flats themselves, instead of quickly reselling the flats for profit. That said, for households facing extenuating circumstances, HDB can consider their appeals to sell their flat within their MOP on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the specific situation of the flat owners and their families. A waiver of the MOP can be granted on exceptional grounds, such as financial hardship, divorce, or the demise of the owner. In such cases, the flat owners may already be subject to the Seller's Stamp Duty, depending on when they purchased their flat and how long they have owned it. Imposing an additional gains tax may impose an unnecessary burden on these households and aggravate their difficulties. For households that do not face extenuating circumstances, allowing them to sell their flat within their MOP, even with a tiered gains tax, would compromise the intent of the MOP to encourage owner-occupation. It would also favour wealthier households who can afford the gains tax, and may not sufficiently deter the speculative purchase of HDB flats, by buyers who are willing to accept the post-tax profits from quickly reselling their bought flats."

"Mr Chairman, on behalf of all Members who filed cuts, I would like to thank Minister Desmond Lim, Minister of State Sam Tan and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim for their considered responses, which I found very assuring. I cannot help but notice that I have been filing cuts to MSF and the former MCYS for the last 14 Committees of Supply. The number of cuts has been progressively coming down. It is a good sign. I think it shows that the Government has been resolving more issues even as new ones cropped up. It leaves me now to thank all the men and women at MSF and all those in the social service sector for their good work, their consistent work all these years in our on-going journey to make Singapore more caring, more compassionate and a more inclusive society.

"MOE reviews its Sexuality Education curriculum regularly, guided by research, specialist expertise and stakeholder feedback. As matters relating to sexuality are sensitive and need careful handling, Sexuality Education teachers are specially nominated by their school leaders to be trained by MOE. Like all educators, Sexuality Education teachers have to exercise professionalism and not impose their personal views and beliefs on their students, or advance the interest of any advocacy, political or religious group in school. The MOE Sexuality Education is secular in nature, taught in the context of values that reflect Singapore’s mainstream society, and focuses on equipping students with age-appropriate knowledge and skills. Students are taught to treat everyone with respect and empathy. Sexuality Education teachers also guide students to understand, evaluate and respect multiple perspectives, without discrimination or stigmatisation. Our schools are committed to provide a caring, respectful and enabling environment for all students through fostering empathy and building positive relationships."
"None 16 To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the Ministry will consider increasing the value of the $150 Climate-Friendly Households Programme e-voucher for energy-efficient refrigerators given the significantly higher cost of a three-tick refrigerator; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider covering more aspects of residents’ emission-emitting activities, such as through offering vouchers for bicycles. asked the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in view of the low take-up rate of the Climate-Friendly Households Programme, whether the Ministry has surveyed eligible households and conducted outreach to better understand the reasons for the low take-up rate."
"The Land Transport Authority (LTA) maintains more than 100 km of expressways, more than 700 km of arterial roads, and more than 2,000 km of minor roads in Singapore. LTA conducts inspections regularly to ensure their serviceability, looking out for not only potholes, but also defects in lane markings, signs, kerbs, et cetera. The frequency of the inspections ranges from once a week for expressways to once every two weeks for major roads to once every eight weeks for minor roads. Defects such as potholes are typically repaired within 24 hours upon discovery. Members of the public who wish to provide feedback on road matters can do so by calling the LTA Hotline. LTA also takes additional measures to reduce the frequency of the occurrence of potholes, ranging from patching of localised road sections to resurfacing of entire stretches of roads. LTA is also studying the feasibility of using asphalt preserver and asphalt mix additives to prevent the formations of potholes."
"Over the past three years, the National Environment Agency (NEA) issued more than 11,000 tickets for smoking along common corridors and void decks of HDB estates. This makes up about 15% of the total number of tickets issued for smoking in prohibited places during that period. I urge smokers to be mindful of the health of others and not light up in smoking-prohibited places. Families and friends, and even members of the public, can help remind smokers to reinforce the right social norms. Over the same period, NEA took more than 2,200 enforcement actions against high-rise littering from HDB flats involving cigarette litter. This makes up about 76% of the total enforcement actions taken for high-rise littering during that period. High-rise littering is an anti-social act which affects safety as well as environmental hygiene. I urge everyone to play his or her part to keep our common spaces clean and ensure that Singapore remains a clean, green and sustainable home for all of us."
"On the first point that the Member mentioned, I would like to clarify that we actually do not prosecute Singaporean sex workers for sex offences, for providing sexual services, because it is not an offence. But for the foreign sex workers, they have committed an immigration offence and that is why they have to be deported. On the second point about transiting out of sex work, I mentioned that we have various policies in place and this is something that the Government will also look into actively to help Singaporean sex workers transit out of the sex trade. On the last point on a dialogue, I think that the Police, when they do come into contact with the sex workers, they do interact with them. But if he feels that there is a way for us to work even closer with VWOs to engage the sex workers, we will be happy to work with the Member further on this. [(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

"Mdm Speaker, for the bus drivers concerned who participated in the illegal strike, let us be clear. They violated the laws and what we did was to take action to deal with the particular circumstances. In this instance, the PRC drivers, the 29 who were repatriated, were interviewed and given the opportunity to air their grievances and we registered them and took action accordingly. In the investigation process, we assessed as to the culpability of the different bus drivers who were involved. There were many more bus drivers involved, but we were able to differentiate the level of involvement and the degree of responsibility each of the different bus drivers had in participating in the particular incident. So, in our case, I would say that what we needed to do was to deal with the particular situation. Bus drivers violated the laws and we have to deal with it. In this case, for the 29 to be repatriated and made sure that investigations had taken place. We interviewed all the different bus drivers involved to make sure that they had the opportunity to register and air their concerns before we dealt with them. Obviously, there were also other bus drivers who, we felt, warranted much more serious action, and those actions are in the process of unfolding as we speak."
"Mr Chairman, I thank Dr Neo for the suggestion. In fact, it has been tweaked, it has been evolving. JSS today is different from what it used to be, because now we have partitions, we provide more privacy, we give flexibility and anyone that comes with medical conditions with a reason that they need to stay alone, we are prepared to consider, we are prepared to be flexible and allow them to stay on their own. So, it is not a blanket no. We do provide flexibility for those with medical conditions and with exceptional circumstances to stay on their own. The reason why we cannot depart from this and say, ""Everyone live on their own now"", is the real constraint which I mentioned earlier. If we are going to double, triple the number of rental units that we have in order to accommodate them, because every JSS tenant wants to split up, we do not have land. That is a real constraint. So, there is no land available to build more. We have got to build new flats, we have got to build new rental flats. I hope Members understand. We are not trying to be hard-hearted about this. There is just not enough space to build so many more new housing units. We try to optimise where we can and as the Senior Parliamentary Secretary said just now, when we did a survey of JSS tenants, the majority of them do get along and are okay. We are dealing with a minority and we can manage that if they do not get along, if there are medical conditions. If they do not get along in the first instance, let us try to find ways to pair you up with somebody else. If you have medical conditions, then we will look at your case, and we will consider allowing you to stay on your own, if there is a need to."
"I thank the Minister for the answer. I am glad to hear her So, it is the post COVID environment that I am concerned about, whether we could be proactive in taking these steps ahead of this situation arising. The fresh graduates would rather wait it out if they can rely on their parents, leading to months of post-graduation unemployment. My concern is whether some of the salary or payslip practices by employers will actually lead to further negative externalities in the future, thus exacerbating unemployment numbers."
"Student safety is paramount for all our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). In planning for overseas programmes, including those under the Global Education Programme, the IHLs take into account MFA's and other international travel advisories, and feedback from their industry and other partners. Should IHLs assess that the planned overseas destination is unsafe or no longer suitable for other reasons, they will make alternative plans, such as changing the destination or postponing the programme until the situation in the host country stabilises. Where necessary, the IHL will cancel the programme. For example, ITE recently cancelled programmes to Hong Kong due to on-going street protests which turned violent. All IHL students bound for overseas programmes are also required to attend pre-trip briefings on safety precautions and what to expect during their visits. The briefing covers important aspects such as mandatory e-registration with MFA, travel insurance coverage, and various emergency assistance hotlines. Should an overseas emergency occur, all IHLs have crisis management plans that will kick into place to protect students as much as possible and keep parents updated of the situation. If necessary, IHLs also engage international service providers to provide emergency medical assistance and evacuation."
"Mr Speaker, may I request that Question Number 35 be redirected from the Minister for National Development to me as the Minister for Finance, please. The Government has a total of about 37,700 tenants who will benefit from the rental waivers. We recognise that there may also be sub-tenancies under some of these main or master tenants. This is why the Government requires all master tenants to sign a written undertaking to pass on at least 80% of the rental waiver granted by the Government to eligible sub-tenants, including coffeeshop stallholders. The requirement to pass on at least 80% of the rental waiver took into account that master tenants may have to incur costs for the space, such as maintenance and cleaning. The written undertaking is legally enforceable and agencies can withhold the rental waiver or even take tenancy action as a last resort if the rental waivers are not passed on to the sub-tenants. If Members of this House encounter any sub-tenant who did not receive Government rental waivers passed down from their master tenants, please direct them to notify the landlord agency who will assist to enforce the rental waiver pass-through."
"Chairman, in 2019, MSF announced that it will be setting up four social service hubs, to be named ComLink, at Jalan Kukoh, Marsiling, Kembangan-Chai Chee and Boon Lay over the next two years. These clusters were selected due to the sizeable number of families and children living in rental flats in those areas. According to MSF, this pilot project announced at Committee Of Supply 2019 provides proactive and integrated support to an estimated 1,000 families living in rental flats to help them achieve sustained stability and social mobility."" This includes supporting families with the potential for homeownership. Minister Desmond Lee mentioned in Parliament that, ""Most importantly, ComLink will develop a sense of community and mutual help, with neighbours supporting one another in their journeys."" Since its inception, has the pilot succeeded in meeting its intended outcomes? Moreover, are there any learning points to be taken away from this pilot project? Also, are there any plans to extend this programme to leverage local community partnerships to support the needs of the families? If so, how will this programme be scalable on a national level in the coming future?"
"Mdm Deputy Speaker, international research shows that paid parental leave, which includes paternity leave, benefits employers in terms of talent attraction, employee retention and productivity. Paternity leave is also associated with stronger relationships between fathers and their children, as well as with their wives. The Government has progressively enhanced parental leave schemes to better support parents and, particularly fathers, in playing a bigger role in raising their children. In 2017, we made the second week of Paternity Leave mandatory and increased Shared Parental Leave from one to four weeks. Fathers can now take up to eight weeks of leave in total in their child's first year, to bond with their newborns and care for their wives. However, supporting the caregiving needs of parents must be balanced with the manpower and operational needs of employers, as I had explained in my Committee of Supply (COS) speech last week. A more sustainable approach is for companies to develop a family-friendly culture. We are heartened that some companies in Singapore are leaning forward to offer additional paternity leave, on top of legislated provisions. There are also other ways to provide more flexible leave options for staff; many companies have signed up to the Tripartite Standards on Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs. We welcome these progressive companies to share their experiences and best practices with other companies. As the needs of companies vary, employers, in partnership with their employees, are best placed to assess and implement the family-friendly arrangements suited to the company's context. We will continue to work with tripartite partners to review the scope for more parental leave provisions and build a Singapore that is Made For Families."
"Sir, we have recently heard cases of NSmen, NSF and regulars going beyond the call of duty, at times even risking their own lives. I believe it is only right that those who are willing to give their lives should have their lives well taken care of. For a start, our NSF should have free universal health insurance coverage. As I understand, NSF has to opt in to purchase insurance coverage at about $16 if they want additional coverage. We need to take into considerations lower ranking NSF from low-income family. Another issue concerns compensation for death or injury of servicemen. MINDEF pegs this to compensation paid out under the Workmen's Compensation Act. I understand they also payout discretionary sums above the benchmark amount. But there is no recourse for a civil suit, if there is a good case for an affected serviceman to pursue higher compensation. Could the Minister spell out the clearer framewok of compensation in such cases, rather than rely on discretionary case-by-case basis of compensation? Training and Development"
"MHA has, indeed, observed an increase in illegal football betting during major international football tournaments, including the World Cup. In anticipation of this, the Police have stepped up enforcement efforts during this World Cup 2022 period. The Police are also working with various stakeholders to disable telephone lines that are reported to be used for advertising illegal gambling activities, block access to illegal gambling content and websites, as well as close bank accounts involved with illegal gambling activities. The National Crime Prevention Council has launched a campaign to warn the public about the risks of betting with illegal operators. In addition, the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) has launched a new campaign to caution the public on excessive football betting. The NCPG video is screened before and during football matches on television. There will also be advertisements on radio, newspaper and social media platforms. Ultimately, however, individuals must exercise personal responsibility. Family members and friends should also look out for people close to them who may be affected by problem gambling and encourage them to seek help by calling the NCPG Helpline (1800-6-668-668) or Webchat (www.ncpg.org.sg)."
"Divorcees with shared care and control of children have an equal right to list their children in their flat application. At the same time, any individual is only allowed to be listed in one HDB flat application. We therefore require divorced parents to come to an agreement before either party lists their child in a flat application. This ensures fairness to all parties, as HDB is not in a position to determine which parent should exercise the right to do so. For cases where the ex-spouse has bought a private property or HDB flat after the divorce, they may still wish to list the child in a future flat application. As such, HDB will have to consider the circumstances of each case individually and will not be able to waive the mutual agreement requirement as a blanket policy. We understand that is not always possible for divorced parties to reach an agreement on who can list the child in a flat application, especially if the divorce was acrimonious. Those who are unable to reach an agreement with their ex-spouse can approach HDB to discuss their options. HDB will review each case and is prepared to exercise flexibility to ensure that both parties have options to provide housing for themselves and their children."
"Any employer wishing to pilot a four-day work week with their staff can do so, as there is no legal impediment to implementing such a scheme. We have noted reports of such small-scale pilots in some countries and their initial results. Given the current economic situation in Singapore, the Ministry is prioritising core issues such as uplifting low-wage workers, job creation, developing the Singaporean Core and enhancing the effectiveness of fair employment rules. We also continue to promote work-life harmony by supporting initiatives such as flexible work arrangements and the Alliance for Action on Work Life Harmony that was launched earlier this year. Having said that, we welcome research or studies by others that can contribute to the development of policies that are pro-worker and pro-business."
