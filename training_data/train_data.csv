"There have been three cases in the past five years where air-conditioners became dislodged and fell. As homeowners are responsible for the maintenance of their air-conditioning units and their accompanying installations, the homeowners in these cases were issued composition fines under the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (BMSMA). Under the BMSMA, BCA can issue a Notice to homeowners to carry out improvement works to their air-conditioning units, should there be evidence of disrepair. This includes installations like the metal brackets holding the air-conditioning units in place. The Act also allows for errant homeowners to be issued composition fines or prosecuted. To reduce the risk of incidents, new buildings are designed with concrete ledges or steel casings to hold the air-conditioning units. In addition, the installation of air-conditioning units on the building exterior can only be performed by trained installers. This is to ensure that the work complies with safety requirements and that it is carried out in the manner stipulated under the Building Control Regulations. MND also worked with Town Councils to disseminate flyers informing residents of their responsibilities for maintaining their air-conditioning units. While the occurrence of falling air-conditioning units is rare, we cannot be complacent. The government will continue to engage homeowners and remind them of the role that they play in creating a safe living environment. Homeowners should also carry out checks every six months to ensure that there are no loosened or corroded parts in their air-conditioning units, as well as in the installations that hold these units in place."
"On 22 August 2021, a decorative feature on the rooftop of 3013 Bedok Industrial Park E dislodged and fell. Following the incident, BCA directed the building owner, JTC, to appoint a Professional Engineer (PE) to carry out a detailed investigation of the incident and to recommend rectification measures to be taken. As a safety precaution, the PE will also inspect adjacent buildings with similar features. Investigations are currently ongoing and are expected to be completed by end September 2021. The Periodic Façade Inspection (PFI) regime will apply to buildings that are above 20 years old and 13 metres in height (or roughly four storeys). Façade inspections must be conducted by trained personnel every seven years. The PFI regime will take effect from early next year, and BCA will regularly review the corresponding requirements to ensure public safety."
"I thank Mr Pritam Singh for the question. What we have started is an increase in terms of the surveillance with regard to the Fair Consideration Framework. Where we have started is, first and foremost, the Fair Consideration Framework or FCF where we are monitoring all these companies that have problems in terms of over-concentration. On top of that, we also work with these companies, with the HR directors, to see where the problem is. Sometimes, it could be, for instance, concentration in one particular sector industry. In other instances, it could be because of the skillsets, whether they are lacking or whether it could be the fact that Singaporeans do not want those jobs. That is the kind of engagement that I was alluding to. So, suffice to say, today, we have stepped up, we are all working very hard to make sure that the companies work with the relevant authorities to ensure that this fair hiring, non-discriminatory type of practices is more prevalent across all the companies in Singapore."
"Thank you, Chairman. I just have two points of clarification. First point I believe would be to Minister. It is very heartening to hear Minister talk about the tripartite, or should I say, the quartripartite because it involves four parties task force. Can Minister, perhaps, share more regarding when we can expect more details on this task force in terms of, perhaps, a budget and opportunities and would there also be opportunities for mid-career professionals in terms of this task force's framework that is due to be set up to allow them, perhaps, to do a professional conversion programme as it were. Another point of clarification is for Senior Parliamentary Secretary Faishal. The Centre Management System (CMS) would certainly help many parents to register for early childhood and so. Would it be compulsory for all early childhood centres to come onto this CMS programme? And when can we expect the CMS to be rolled out into the sector?"
"Mdm Chair, the Government recently announced the new plans for our $19 billion RIE2020 effort. It is vital that we maximise our returns from our R&D spend, a critical investment that takes a significant share of our budget expenditure even as our fiscal position gets tighter. I support the Government's sharpened focus on growing our capabilities in research translation, innovation, and facilitating start-ups, so that research and innovation can be applied to our economic and social needs. Germany has a robust system of applying R&D to drive innovations in their businesses. One factor that facilitates this is the practice where Professors at German universities often hold concurrent appointments overseeing R&D at industry groups, allowing for seamless testing and implementation for research initiatives. I would like to ask the Minister how our future approach to R&D will differ from those of the past. How will the Government support linkages across R&D value chain to bring technology inventions from the labs into our industries and grow strong industry clusters. Madam, I am heartened to read in The Business Times that SMEs' 2014 R&D expenditure surged 38% to $800 million. I would like to ask the Minister what percentage of $800 million is a function of Government support, and whether such expenditure translates to increase in competitiveness and productivity? I would also like to ask the Minister for his insights on the performance of R&D in the various sectors and how such insights will help guide future Government funding support, including how SMEs can tap the RIE2020 to drive innovation and scale their businesses."
"The Government supports online commercial activities that use personal data for legitimate purposes. However, there must be accountability and transparency to safeguard individuals’ interests. Organisations which collect, use and disclose personal data for serving relevant advertisements are required to notify individuals clearly and obtain their consent. Organisations cannot obtain this consent through misleading or deceptive practices and cannot require consent from individuals beyond what is reasonable to provide a service to them. The Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) has set out its position in advisory guidelines which highlight the data protection measures organisations need to put in place. These include obtaining individuals’ consent for the collection of personal data through cookies for targeting advertisements. The PDPC is monitoring international regulatory developments, as well as recent developments in the advertising technology industry such as the advent of privacy preserving means for targeted advertising. The PDPC will put in place additional measures, where relevant, to strengthen accountability of organisations and to ensure that the terms of consent are communicated clearly. Consumers can also do their part. They may wish to withhold consent if they consider the request to be excessive, or suspect the legitimacy of the organisation and the manner in which consent was sought."
"Based on data as at end 2016, there were about 120 ComCare beneficiaries who were HDB flat owners aged 65 and above, and were living without other co-owners, registered occupants or tenants. As at end 2020, this figure increased to 560. This may be due to an increase in the number of elderly living alone in our ageing population, and greater accessibility to ComCare through the set-up of MSF’s Social Services Offices island-wide. In addition, the Silver Generation Office has outreach efforts to provide our elderly with information on available support schemes. These ComCare beneficiaries receive a package of assistance which may include cash assistance for their daily living expenses and assistance with their household and medical bills. If they have other needs, such as being at risk of social isolation, MSF’s Social Service Offices will link them up with relevant services such as befriending support. They can also take part in active ageing programmes offered by the People’s Association and Senior Activity Centres."
"Residents facing emotional distress can be assisted by various touchpoints in the community, such as the Family Service Centres (FSC), counselling centres, and healthcare institutions. Typically, these agencies operate during office hours (some have extended hours on selected days), and residents can either walk in or contact them to schedule an appointment. After office hours, a resident who is emotionally distressed may call the National Care Hotline (Tel  1800-202-6868, 8am to 12 midnight) or 24-hour crisis hotlines like Samaritans of Singapore (SOS – Tel  1800-221-444) and the Institute of Mental Health’s (IMH) Mental Health Helpline (Tel  6389-2222). Members of the public may call the Police when they come across an emotionally distressed resident who is posing a risk to the safety of self or others. Based on the facts and circumstances of the case, Police will provide the necessary assistance which may include referring the resident for social assistance and psychiatric examination."
"Chairman, in Malay. (In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] Since last August, Saudi Arabia has welcomed international vaccinated Umrah pilgrims, after a gap of one and a half years due to COVID-19. In fact, many Singaporeans performed their Umrah during this pandemic. As Umrah for international pilgrims has resumed since last August, could we expect the Haj to resume for Singapore pilgrims for this year, too? In last August too, I asked a Parliamentary Question during the tensions in Palestine. Minister for Foreign Affairs explained how the Government has, through the Enhanced Technical Assistance Programme (ETAP), trained over 500 Palestinian officials in public administration, economic and urban development. Singapore also sponsored Palestinian students to pursue post-graduate degrees in our local Universities. Many thanks to our MFA officers. Can the Minister for Foreign Affairs update us on efforts to support capacity building in the Palestinian Authority?"
"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have two clarifications. On the point of what the Senior Minister has said, the focus is to get the expanded agreement in force. So, I guess the question is what is being done now to ensure that those agreements will come into force? How do we get these three agreements into force? On another question  the Minister for Transport had indicated that these agreements, like the FIR, will benefit Changi Airport and Singapore. But could the Minister provide more information and details on how these would benefit both Changi Airport as well as Singapore?"
"Chairman, Sir, the pace of change had taken speed like no other in the past decade and even more so, in recent years. This is not only a result of globalisation but also technological disruptions, adaptability to changes and dynamics in geopolitical situations. The world today is interconnected in many ways. The recent COVID-19 has shown just how one key aspect, the disruption of supply chain, can have global impact on trade. Despite the intense connectivity between countries on many fronts, there are signs of bifurcation and turbulence constantly seen globally. Amidst growing uncertainties in our region, it is important that we keep our engagement with key regional and strategic partners outside our immediate neighbourhood and forge closer links with countries that share similar strategic perspective as us and will offer economic and other opportunities for cooperation. As Singapore continues to be heavily dependent on trade and partnerships, we need to renew our efforts in maintaining relationships and explore new areas of cooperation with different countries. For instance, Singapore shares close people-to-people ties and multifaceted cooperation with Japan and the Republic of Korea. With Australia, we also share similar views on the importance of an open rules-based and inclusive multilateral system. Further, there are opportunities for cooperation with India, which is also a growing market in Asia with tremendous economic potential and promising democratic dividends. In this regard, I would like to ask how MFA intends to strengthen our engagement with such key partners in the region to ensure that Singapore remains a relevant stakeholder."
"When we look at outcomes, we look at a variety of things. Obviously, we want to look at efficiency, we want to make sure, depending on the project, reliability. If the question is  will we look solely at one factor, for example, ""Does this result in employment of a certain group?"", it cannot be seen in isolation. So, where we can, we try to encourage businesses to employ. But that is really done through the work of MOM and it cannot be a single type of factor driving the way that project requirements are structured, because then you might have all sorts of other unintended outcomes."
"Madam, it is critical that the Government extends its support for Continuing Education and Training (CET) to facilitate workers, especially older workers who are 45 years and above, to acquire the skill sets to remain as productive stakeholders in the restructured economy. With skills getting obsolete ever so quickly on the back of globalisation, providing continuing education must be emphasised just as much as pre-employment education. To this end, I welcome the Government's initiatives, such as Workfare Training Support and the $500 million topping up of the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund. However, I hope that the Government can do more. First, I hope that the Ministry can consider an annual spending target on CET equivalent to a certain percentage of GDP, similar to how MOE targets its spending on pre-employment education. Second, I hope CET can offer vocational courses with more rigour, for example, Diplomas in Mechanical or Aerospace Engineering via modular courses at our ITE or Polytechnics. Third, I hope enrolment to CET programmes will consider job experience and existing skills and not just be solely based on prior academic qualifications. Fourth, I hope MOE can work closely with MOM and industry associations to identify possible ways of collaboration and to bring about more awareness of these programmes."
"I thank the Minister for the clarifications. As rightly pointed out, I also personally received a lot of feedback. On the ground, people are commenting that the court let those who are rich go lightly and also those who can get off for religious reasons. The worst is they also commented that for this particular case, it was handled by a so-called lawyer who is also a Member of Parliament from PAP. So, may I know what is the Minister's stand on this and a clarification on his comments. Also, what can the Government do about all these comments and also how should we proceed from here?"
"Construction at all 89 ongoing HDB BTO projects has resumed following the Circuit Breaker period last year. However, project timelines have been affected due to the Circuit Breaker period, strict safe management measures put in place for work at construction sites to resume, and global supply chain disruptions and manpower shortages within the construction industry. About 85% of these ongoing BTO projects have been delayed by about six to nine months beyond the Estimated Completion Dates (ECDs) originally indicated to buyers during project launches. The extent of the delay varies by BTO project, and depends on site-specific factors such as manpower availability, the contractor’s performance and materials supply. HDB is closely monitoring the construction progress of all BTO projects and will work with contractors to meet the revised completion dates. HDB is also working with various agencies on mitigating measures to reduce the length of delays. This includes getting exemptions to allow less noisy construction activities to be carried out on Sundays and Public Holidays where possible. HDB is progressively updating affected flat buyers on the revised completion dates through letters and the My HDBPage as construction progresses. Those unable to find alternative housing arrangements in the interim with family members, relatives or on the open market may contact HDB for assistance. As at end February 2021, HDB has updated about 43,000 affected households on the delay, of which around 240 households were assisted with Interim Rental Housing (IRH) flats."
"I have two supplementary questions. The first is whether there are any plans to make any investigations into such complaints about sexual violence and sexual misconduct, whether to make them independent to give students better confidence? So, basically, independent in the sense that it is not undertaken by the Universities or the institutions themselves. My second question is, as Ms Carrie Tan mentioned earlier, the Minister of State has responded regarding Secondary school level, steps taken for these students to make sure that they are aware of sexuality and issues relating to consent, is the Ministry taking any proactive steps to making sure to examine whether this is also a problem at younger levels, and whether there is any studies being conducted at the Secondary school level to see whether there are any problems? So, just being proactive and find out whether it is an issue."
"In my earlier response, what NAC and NHB have full control or better control over are the artists that we contract directly. As for those who are through intermediaries or event organisers, we will definitely influence and encourage them to adopt such standards. Ultimately, we want our freelancers – they are all very hardworking, talented people – we would want them to have meaningful careers but also at the same time, financially viable careers. So, this is a first step we are doing. We hope to lead by example. And we hope that the society at large, all users, procurers of artistic talent and works, will also respect the freelancers' way of business as part of the overall gig economy that Singapore is experiencing together with the world. So that is something we will work on. I would like Mr Kok Heng Leun to repeat his question on the mid-career artists?"
"I thank the Member for her clarification. With the injection of new BTOs in the Dawson area, Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) has planned new centres, as well as extension of existing centres, to increase preschool places to address the increase in demand. I also want to make a general point that, for other New Towns or some of the older estates where there are new insertions of BTOs, ECDA On the Member's second question, currently, parents may register their interest in a preschool via the Preschool Search Portal, which is an online self-help portal. On this portal, parents can actually search by proximity, understand more about which are the centres that are available, what is the waitlist situation like."
"PUB was alerted to discoloured tap water at some parts of the Basic Military Training Centre, or BMTC, at Pulau Tekong at 7.30 am on 20 November 2019. PUB officers were activated immediately to investigate the cause of the incident and deployed water wagons to provide temporary water supply to the servicemen on Pulau Tekong. PUB also worked with BMTC to flush the water supply network on Pulau Tekong and carried out water sampling tests in the network to ensure that the water is safe for consumption and within the drinking water quality standards under the Environmental Public Health Regulations 2019 and the World Health Organization’s (WHO) guidelines. The water supply was fully restored at 9.30 pm on 21 November 2019. Naturally occurring minerals in the water will settle and accumulate in the water supply network over time. PUB investigated and found that these minerals in the pipes serving BMTC were churned up, thus affecting the appearance of the water. The tap water turned clear after flushing of the water supply network. As a preventive measure, PUB is working with BMTC to carry out cleaning of the water mains in Pulau Tekong during the first half of 2020, when there is a break in BMTC's training schedule."
"As of June 2014, there were 183,900 freelance workers, forming 8.7% of employed residents compared to 9.4% 10 years ago in 2004. Freelance workers are persons who operate their own business or trade. This means that they are their own employers. They decide which service contracts to enter into. There is no employer-employee relationship between them and their clients. For this reason, they are not covered by the Employment Act (EA). Freelance workers who are not paid by their clients can seek legal redress by commencing proceedings against their clients at the State Courts, which includes the Small Claims Tribunal, depending on the nature of the claim or disputed amount."
"In the latest breakdown of economically inactive persons in Labour Force Survey 2013, there were 8,600 discouraged workers. These are persons who are not actively looking for a job because they believe their job search will not yield results. There are others who want to work but cannot because of family responsibilities like childcare, care-giving to family and relatives, and housework. Almost half of the over 300,000 economically inactive women cited these reasons. There were also over 85,000 time-related underemployed residents. These are part-timers who were willing and available to work additional hours but are unable to find better work. Finally, there are underemployed workers who are doing work that they are overqualified for. Many older PMEs are in this group. May I ask the Minister  (1) What is MOM doing to help discouraged workers to find work? (2) How does MOM help the underemployed to increase their working hours or find jobs commensurate with their skills and experience? (3) And how is MOM working with companies and other agencies to remove structural impediments to employment, like lack of childcare, student care, eldercare or flexi-work arrangements? Can MOM publish a new aggregate measure of labour under-utilisation that factors in not only the unemployment rate, but also discouraged workers, the underemployed and economically inactive persons who want to return to the workforce? Tracking this measure will help focus minds on factors that lead to a lower labour force participation rate, which has a direct impact on economic growth and household incomes."
"Mdm Speaker, I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. He spoke about Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Planning, and there was quite a bit of stress in terms of infrastructure. Such things also involve typically process and ensuring that there is regular updating of these processes and performance of the tasks, like how you would do fire drills. What is IDA's framework with regard to this, and has SingTel been performing these exercises prior to the fire? Also, do the requirements involve the other operators? I also note that M1 and Starhub were also affected as they link back to the OpenNet infrastructure. The Minister also touched on IDA's new audit framework that is to be launched in the second half. Will that also mean that IDA will now practically audit service providers? The proactiveness is important. Is it also time to look at more stringent requirements because of our heavy dependence, compared to other developed countries, on the communications infrastructure today?"
"Between 2016 and 2021, about 120 each year or 7% of all Specialists who were not Warrant Officers left the SAF to pursue careers in other sectors, before the age of 50. Specialists retiring from the SAF, typically close to or at the age of 50, are provided with the career transition support which includes dedicated career coaching, as well as funds and time-off for courses, job interviews, and internships to transit into their next job role. Based on surveys conducted by our Career Transition Resource Centre, the majority of the retiring specialists who intend to continue working are able to secure jobs in roles such as training, security, operations and administration."
"Sir, I thank Mr Ang for his questions. I think we should view the IATA Travel Pass (ITP), and also other forms of such certificates, as a two-step process. The first step is how do we establish ways to verify the authenticity of these certificates? So, in other words, I need to make sure that when you say that you are tested and it is PCR negative, or when you say that you are vaccinated, I can trust that this information is accurate and there is a way to do this. So, I think that is the first step  establishing the checks to verify how authentic, how accurate is this information. The second step is, once you have this information, then what do you do with it. That is a separate discussion. Just because the individual comes from a particular country and has been tested negative or has been vaccinated, does not mean that we automatically do away with some of the restrictions. Because it really depends on, first of all, what is the rate of infection in that source country, how confident are we of the risk level of this individual, when he or she travels to Singapore. And that would then determine what kind of safeguards we put in place. So, I think to answer Mr Ang's questions, this is an on-going discussion with the countries that I mentioned earlier. But we should view this, really, as a two-stage process."
"Sorry, Mr Chairman, just a very quick response and not to belabour the matter. I understand that the Member may have put in the amendments earlier. All I am saying is that it actually would be helpful, even though the Standing Orders have a specific procedural requirement of time, that you can actually of your own volition also notify the Government ahead of time so that it would actually give us a little bit more time. So, that is all I am saying, in terms of just a matter of adequate time and preparation. In this case, we had taken a decision and looked at it, and decided not to put forward the recommendation. But I would just like to remind Members that one does not go to the President with less than 48 hours and say, ""Here it is, please make a decision."" If something was put forward, the President would have to consider it and it would take some time. But in this case, as the Government, having taken the decision, had made the decision not to put it forward for the reasons stated."
"The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) took enforcement action against 36 cases of unauthorised short-term subletting in private residential premises in 2014, 23 cases in 2015, and 44 cases in the first six months of 2016. Altogether, there were 103 such cases between 2014 and mid-2016. Once URA confirms a case of unauthorised short-term subletting, it sends an enforcement notice to the offender requiring the unauthorised use to cease. In the vast majority of cases, offenders have complied with URA’s notices and there has been no need to undertake further action against them. URA’s public consultation on short-term rentals concluded in April 2015. The review is still ongoing. The issue of allowing short-term rentals warrants careful and balanced review without a rush to conclusion. In particular, we must carefully consider the implications of doing so, given the potential impact and disamenity of such rentals on neighbouring residents. In the meantime, URA’s existing requirement for a minimum tenancy duration of six-month in private residential rentals continues to apply."
"Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his supplementary question. In fact, we are not depending on the WIS Scheme alone to help low-wage workers build up retirement adequacy. Aside from WIS, we have taken various steps to help low-wage workers. This includes higher interest rates of up to 6% on the first $30,000 of CPF balances for members age 55 and above. We have also liberalised our CPF transfer rules to enable members who have met their BRS to support their spouses and parents with lower balances through CPF transfers. So, in other words, if you are a WIS recipient, you can also get help from other members of the family.  In 2016, we introduced the Silver Support scheme to supplement the retirement incomes of the bottom 20% of the elderly who earned lower wages through life, and currently have little or no family support. Overall it is an approach that encourages individual effort, as well as family support, supplemented by Government top-ups and schemes which strengthen social protection. As to the Member’s concern about inflation, under the CPF LIFE Scheme, CPF members, not just those who do not meet the Basic Retirement Sum, can opt for the CPF LIFE Escalating Plan. What that would enable them to do is to accept a lower monthly pay-out when they start, but over time, to have the pay-outs increase to meet their spending needs. The CPF LIFE Escalating Plan started on 1 January 2018."
"As I have mentioned, there is a range of punishments and disciplinary actions that are possible. If a public servant is suspected of committing a crime, then that is fully investigated, the papers are referred to the Attorney-General's Chambers and charges will be put out against him, if the Attorney-General so decides. That is a trial in Court, and he is subject to the full weight of the law. So that is in those circumstances.  If, however, there has been no criminal offence but the public officer has still fallen short of what the Service expects of him, either in his supervisory capacity or in adherence to specific rules or the Codes of Conduct in the Public Service, but which does not amount to a criminal offence, then the Public Service will deal with him either departmentally through his Permanent Secretary or in more serious cases of this type, with the Public Service Commission. And the whole range is available, including warnings, reprimands, and so on. In deciding on what to do, his Permanent Secretary and the Public Service Commission will take into account all factors, including the severity and culpability of the officer in specific cases and also whether there are any mitigating circumstances, for example, the overall service record of the officer and also what other contributions he may have made, in this particular case. So, those are fully taken into account. And that separates criminal charges versus shortcomings in the officer's performance. In the case of a person who has been issued with a warning, this enters formally into his record and can have implications on his performance-based pay components, for example, his performance bonuses, his increments, and can have an effect on his progression."
"The Circuit Breaker and phased re-opening since April this year have caused delays to the completion of the Thomson-East Coast Line Stage 2 (TEL2). Notwithstanding, we will be able to make up for some lost time, so TEL2 will open by 1Q 2021, a three-month delay from the original schedule of opening by this year. However, unlike the TEL2 which is near completion and prioritised for resumption of work, we will only be able to better assess the length of delays on subsequent phases of TEL and other MRT projects when construction activities have more fully resumed. The Government remains committed to significantly expand the MRT network, from around 230km today to 360km by the early 2030s. This includes opening the remaining stages of the Thomson-East Coast Line, completing the circle with Circle Line Stage 6, as well as building the North East Line Extension, Jurong Region Line and Cross Island Line."
"Mr Chairman, transnational families form a significant proportion of our population today. Between 2009 and 2015, around 15,000 citizen children were born to non-resident foreign mothers. In 2018, one in four citizen marriages involved a non-resident. Such families often live with tremendous uncertainty because the foreign spouse must continuously apply for the right to stay in Singapore. ICA does not publicly disclose the exact criteria for granting or renewing a visit pass. Foreign spouses are placed in a vulnerable position within their marriage because of this uncertainty. Community organisations who work with abuse survivors or migrants have seen many cases of the citizen spouse threatening to cancel their pass as a way to abuse their foreign wives. Transnational families, particularly lower income ones, also have limited housing options. Citizens can purchase HDB flats but they are treated as singles for housing grants and foreign spouses cannot be co-owners. In cases of divorce or widowhood, the foreign spouse faces even more uncertainty. The Government has said it will help facilitate a renewable LTVP, as long as they have custody over young Singaporean children. This is very welcome but not a guarantee. The foreign spouse also has no right to occupy or inherit an HDB flat, causing great anxiety over housing. Can the Government allow citizens married to LTVP+ holders to qualify as a family for the Public Rental Scheme? Can the Government provide greater support and protection to these vulnerable families by granting the LTVP+ to all foreign spouses of citizens? Can the Government consider creating a clear, timed pathway for these foreign spouses to obtain Permanent Residence status?"
"Based on data from 2017 to 2021, approximately 1% – or 200 out of 19,000 – of women who had attempted Assisted Reproduction (AR) treatment had fully utilised all six co-funded ART cycles and did not achieve a successful live birth. Amongst those who have fully utilised all six co-funding cycles without a successful live birth, approximately 50% of them, or 100 women, have continued to seek ART treatments, that is, started a seventh cycle, without any co-funding in either public or private AR centres."
"Madam, we have made concrete progress in recent years in making public transport more accessible to disabled persons. There are two areas I wish to highlight for further review. First, the space available on buses for wheelchairs. The Minister previously confirmed that 92% of public buses today are wheelchair-accessible and the goal is to make this 100% by 2020. While certainly welcome, the fact is that the number of wheelchairs that a bus can accommodate is very limited. According to the operators' websites, SMRT buses can accommodate two wheelchairs, while some SBS Transit buses can only accommodate one. I have received feedback from disabled persons living in a charitable home about the difficulties posed when a few wheelchair-bound persons need to travel at the same time. Due to the limited space on board, they would need to board the buses in turn, and wait at their destinations for subsequent buses carrying their friends to arrive, greatly increasing their travelling time. Besides their personal situation, they also rightly point out that as the general population ages, we can expect that a few wheelchair-bound persons may need to be on board the same bus at the same time. Now with the Bus Contracting Model, where the Government owns all operating assets, I ask the Government to look into having buses with more wheelchair space. Secondly, while we may have made good infrastructural improvements and removed physical barriers, it is vital that our public transport emergency plans provide for the safety and safe evacuation of persons with disabilities. Should a contingency arise, say, in the MRT system that requires evacuation or diversion of passengers, do our emergency plans spell out how we will communicate and protect those who are physically or mentally impaired including the wheelchair-bound or those impaired in vision or hearing? To what extent have such plans been exercised?"
"In 2020, HDB received about 2,500 cases of feedback per month relating to noise from residents' activities, including renovation noise. Such feedback increased by about 25% in 2021 to 3,200 per month. The increase is likely due to work-from-home arrangements, coupled with the resumption of renovation activity in June 2020. Over the years, HDB has made improvements in the construction materials used for better sound insulation. For example, since the mid-1980s, the walls between two flats are made with 100-millimetre reinforced concrete, instead of the hollow blocks used in older flats. In addition, for flats built since 1995, the floor slabs are made of at least 150-millimetre thick bare concrete, which provide better impact noise insulation, compared to the 125-millimetre bare concrete used in older flats. More recently, since February 2017, buyers of Build-to-Order (BTO) flats can also choose to have vinyl strip flooring in their bedrooms, which further reduces sounds from impact. These improvements help to reduce noise transmission within and between HDB flats. HDB has also taken proactive design measures to minimise noise disturbances, such as situating or orientating HDB blocks away from noise sources and locating multi-storey car parks next to expressways to act as noise buffers. HDB will continue to explore practical solutions to mitigate noise. At the same time, it is important for residents to do their part by showing consideration for their neighbours, such as by keeping the noise level down when going about their daily activities, especially late at night, so as to provide a pleasant living environment for all."
"Sir, there will always be some trade-offs when we provide more support that it may inadvertently fuel demand and add to inflationary pressures. That is why we have to manage and calibrate this carefully. And that is why in rolling out or designing the package, we have not made it a broad-based support scheme. We have targeted the lower-income groups, we have given some to the middle-incomes as well. But based on the design of the package, we believe that the impact on inflation will be manageable."
"Patient safety and well-being is a top priority of our public healthcare institutions. We do not tolerate any inappropriate behaviour against patients and will take action where necessary, as with the recent IMH case. Within IMH, staff are trained to care professionally for mental health patients, and staff work in teams to support one another. Care and clinical protocols are also in place to manage challenging situations. Some patients who are well enough participate to improve ward safety through feedback and suggestions during weekly discussions with IMH’s nursing management. Internal nursing auditors carry out monthly audits of staff knowledge, documentation and the environment to ensure the safety of patients and staff. Any unexplained injuries and reported incidents will be thoroughly investigated. Working in the mental healthcare setting can be challenging. IMH looks after the mental well-being of its team by ensuring that staff are equipped with knowledge and skills to de-escalate difficult situations and by instituting peer support for daily work with a team-based work structure. Individualised assistance is also offered to staff who require emotional and psychological support after experiencing work-related challenges. Supervisors and staff are reminded to look out for their fellow colleagues who may be stressed or burnt out and extend support to them. The Ministry will continue to work with our public healthcare institutions to care for the well-being of our patients and healthcare workers."
"Sir, I thank Dr Wan Rizal for his questions. For the first question which is paternal and grandparent involvement, the answer is yes. We are looking at this from a mother and child view, with respect to the science, because that is really where we have the research in terms of pre-conception, what happens in pregnancy, early neo-natal period. But getting things done, the service delivery kind of programmes and activities are really from a family-centric point of view. And so, the whole family is indeed encouraged to join in, to be part of this and to come along the journey. I hope that the fathers out there do not need a special invitation with their name. We are asking the whole family to turn up. So, as the father, he is part of the family, please come and get involved in looking after the young child and the young child's mother, and helping to support them through the journey. The grandparents are naturally involved in very much part of the caregiving in our society. So, we take a family-centric view to involve the whole family. For the actual strategies around screening and interventions, these are still being studied and we have to look to see where we will implement programmes and activities. We will make the announcement in due course. But indeed, getting the right tools to make sure the interventions are effective are going to be important. We will be studying this."
"Understanding the public's needs and preferences is a central part of the Ministry of Finance's work so that we can better allocate public spending to serve the nation's needs. We do so through various methods, including surveys, various feedback channels and direct engagements with citizens. Every year, the Government holds a formal Budget feedback exercise to understand citizens' concerns as part of preparations for the annual Budget. For Budget 2019, REACH had Listening Points across Singapore from 3 December 2018 to 11 January 2019 to provide accessible, open booths for Singaporeans to give their views for Budget 2019. Feedback received during these consultations contribute to the formulation of the Budget and prioritisation of Government expenditures. For example, the increase in social spending in recent years reflects our collective aspirations to better care for one another and to do more for the vulnerable members of our society. At the same time, the Government must also devote appropriate resources to areas serving the collective good, like defence, law and order, and public infrastructure. We will continue to explore different ways to understand public preferences, and help the public better understand the link between government revenue and expenditure."
"As I mentioned earlier, we do not only just look at shortfall and work towards just filling up the shortfall. We are also having to look at the demands of the public and what are the needs. We do not necessarily find it valuable to make that distinction. As much as possible, we try and see what are the different avenues and channels for us to increase this intake and we are making efforts on that front. We have explained how we have worked with the clusters to see how we can see to the well-being of the nurses and improve the stature of their career, career paths as well as increasing the intake from the different schools. This is an aspect that we are doing and that will never be enough – to reach the 82,000 that we are looking for. Hence, we have to complement that with the efforts we are doing in recruitment of overseas nurses. This is the multi-pronged approach that we are taking and this is something that will, hopefully, increase and improve the situation in time to come."
"I would like to thank Mr Darryl David for that supplementary question. The short answer is, yes, we will see how we can use technology to strengthen our enforcement capabilities. In fact, in previous parliamentary sittings, I had already shared that LTA is currently piloting the use of CCTVs for that purpose. At the same time, we have also implemented MyTransport.SG where the public can snap a picture of the errant rider and, if possible, try to identify the errant rider; if not, at least it will provide some information on where the possible hotspots are."
"At the end of May 2022, more than eight in 10 Secondary schools and pre-University institutions have implemented Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) as part of regular Home-Based Learning (HBL) days. SIL is a component of HBL days where time is set aside for students to pursue their own interests and learn outside the curriculum. This is to encourage students to be more curious and self-directed in their learning. Schools have the flexibility to implement SIL in ways to better support their students’ interests and needs. For example, some schools have facilitated the grouping of students with similar interests so that they can explore their interests together. Some schools have provided students who needed more guidance with suggested activities or resources at the start and will reduce the scaffolds over time. Students have responded positively to SIL, pursuing interests, such as learning foreign languages, learning to play musical instruments, programming, cooking or serving the community. Preliminary feedback indicates that SIL is valued by schools and students. We will evaluate the outcomes when the initiative is fully implemented."
"Mdm Speaker, the CPF Education Scheme allows CPF members to use their CPF Ordinary Account (OA) savings to pay for their own, spouses' or children's tuition fees and this is restricted to full-time subsidised diploma and degree courses at Approved Educational Institutions. When members turn 55, a Retirement Account (RA) is created, and monies from the CPF OA and the Special Account (SA) are transferred to the RA up to the Full Retirement Sum. Members who own a property with sufficient charge or pledge on the property can withdraw their RA savings above the Basic Retirement Sum in cash for any purpose including education. Members who continue to work and make CPF contributions after age 55 will also have fresh OA savings that can be used under the CPF Education Scheme. CPF members with insufficient OA savings should consider other avenues to finance their tertiary education for their children. For example, savings in the Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA), student bursaries and loans offered by MOE and CDC/CCC, or the Tuition Fee Loan Scheme and Study Loan Scheme offered by the Government. There are also various financial assistance schemes offered by the tertiary institutions as well as other community organisations. We recognise that some CPF members may have tried but do not qualify for these financial assistance schemes. So, CPF Board has therefore exercised some flexibility by allowing them to use their savings in their RA that originated from their OA for the purpose of the CPF Education Scheme. However, CPF members must recognise that they are compromising on their retirement adequacy, especially if their children do not or are unable to repay the loan after graduation."
"Since 2017, the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) has received 46,600 complaints on unsolicited calls and text messages. Around 90% of these complaints relate to serious crimes such as unlicensed moneylending and illegal gambling, and are referred to the Singapore Police Force. Of the remainder, about 400 complaints are repeat cases involving the same complainants. The PDPC has taken action against more than 1,000 organisations since 2017. These actions range from issuing advisory notices and warnings, to prosecution. In determining the appropriate enforcement action, the PDPC takes into account factors such as the harm caused, the number of complaints against the organisation and recidivism. The PDPC keeps a close watch on organisations' compliance with the Do Not Call obligations and will not hesitate to take appropriate enforcement action against errant organisations."
"Sir, more universities around the world from the US to Australia and New Zealand are offering micro-credentials, which are like mini-degrees or certifications in a specific field. I am glad our Autonomous Universities are following suit to keep up with the demand. These bite-sized courses are good for our busy individuals who are keen to upgrade and upskill themselves but do not have the time or resources for full-time post-graduate courses. The prestige and reputation of the Autonomous Universities will give students further assurance of the effectiveness and legitimacy of the course materials and assessment methods. Nevertheless, while the main goal of these micro-credentials is to encourage and recognise the mastery of specific skills, many individuals still aspire to attain formal post-graduate qualification. Will the Ministry expand the scheme and allow employees to eventually attain full qualifications from various micro-courses? For example, students who achieve sufficient micro-credentials in business administration topics could convert them into full credits and transfer them into a Bachelor’s Degree in Business Administration. According to Converge, a digital magazine by the Center for Digital Education, which is a national research and advisory institute specialising in higher education technology trends, policy and funding, this are what universities in America are working on. We are gearing away from over-emphasis on academic accomplishments, but formal qualifications are still greatly valued and can be a powerful source of motivation for Singaporeans to pursue skills upgrading and lifelong learning."
"The number of applications made under the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122) (""GIA"") from 2015 to 2019 is as follows   These applications include those for guardianship and other types of applications relating to infants such as maintenance, custody, care, and control under the GIA. We do not track the cases where the guardian appointed under the GIA is not biologically related to the infant. Applications to appoint a guardian under the GIA must first fall within one of the applicable provisions of the GIA. Under section 6 of the GIA, the court may appoint a guardian where  (a) Either the infant's father or mother has passed on and no guardian had been appointed by that father or mother. The court may appoint a guardian to act jointly with the surviving parent. (b) The infant has no parent, no guardian, and no person having parental rights with respect to him. Under section 10, the court may remove and replace an infant's guardian. Testamentary guardians may be appointed by parents by deed or will under section 7. The appointment of the proposed guardian must also be in the best interest of the infant, as the welfare of the infant is the first and paramount consideration in such applications. There is no requirement for the proposed guardian to share a biological relationship with the infant."
"Traffic disruptions can be caused by accidents, road defects, or fallen trees. For accidents, the Traffic Police will respond as quickly as possible to the accident scene. The Singapore Civil Defence Force may also be activated if there are injuries. For road defects that affect traffic safety, LTA will carry out rectification works on an urgent basis. For fallen trees, NParks will deploy its Rapid Response Team as soon as possible. Traffic recovery procedures and response times differ depending on the nature of the incidents. Where there is significant traffic impact, officers will be deployed on the ground to manage the situation. LTA also notifies the public on the incident location and traffic situation via radio and online channels so that they avoid the affected areas."
"Mr Speaker, firstly, the Government has committed to set aside up to $180 million dollars annually over the next five years. And I want to emphasise this  up to $180 million dollars. What is actually going to be disbursed will depend on the specific investments that SMT makes, through their progress updates to MCI, whether we are satisfied that these are the right things to do and that they will produce or they have the likelihood of producing good results. So, it is up to $180 million annually and, therefore, up to $900 million over five years. I am actually not so surprised that Mr Pritam Singh put this question up. And if I may, Mr Pritam Singh's question, again asking about influence on editors, journalist, is too predictable, if I may put it this way. His question seems to suggest that he does not trust the journalists and our mainstream media to be objective in reporting, to apply their minds and to be discerning or to have a sense of responsibility to truthful reporting for the public. I hope I am wrong in thinking that this is what Mr Pritam Singh is suggesting, but that is what came to mind when he spoke those words. Regardless of what I say or what Mr Pritam Singh may suggest, the true test is whether the public trusts the media and how they exercise their choice on a day-to-day basis in consuming news media, when so many alternatives are available to them at zero cost. And, fortunately for us, for all of us, our local mainstream media are trusted by people and we have every reason to keep it so."
"Mr Chairman, patient data is often – and sometimes very – sensitive. It is personal as it may contain information relating to medical conditions and diseases that the patient may want to keep private. The release of this information could cause turmoil to the patient and his or her family – leading to serious stress in relationships. To ensure IT and cyber security specialists operating within the specialised sphere of medical information are trained well and that standards are kept high across health clusters and the many hospitals, would the MOH consider setting up a Medical Cybersecurity Academy to train a core group of medical cybersecurity specialists, share best practices between them and then steadily raise the industry standard such as to protect medical records and the related information contained in them?"
"I want to thank Dr Intan for her questions and I want to assure her that the PSEIs understand the value that the internship will bring to the students. It will better prepare them for work, like she has shared, and the students also understand and appreciate the value that the internship will bring to their CV, really allowing them to have a better appreciation of what they have learnt in school, bridging theory and practice, so that they will be well placed to adjust to the workforce. The example that Dr Intan has mentioned is aligned to why we started the SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme. The SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme is a work-learn initiative that allows the graduates from Polytechnic and ITE immediately upon their graduation, whether it is in ITE or Polytechnic, to join a host company between 12 to 18 months, even longer. It is necessary for them to spend between 12 to 18 months because we are trying to achieve two objectives  to allow them to have meaningful work experience that is aligned to what they have learnt in Polytechnic or ITE; at the same time, to build on that foundation such that they can even articulate to a specialist diploma if they were Polytechnic graduates, or maybe a technical diploma if they graduate from ITE. So, we do have a conduit to facilitate the intent that the Member has mentioned."
"The list of items that are considered to be essential is likely to vary across households in Singapore and different countries depending on their specific needs. I will highlight the price trends for food and healthcare to illustrate the difference in inflation rates across countries. Between the first half of 2019 and the first half of 2022, food prices rose at a faster rate in the US, Eurozone and South Korea - by 4.9%, 3.3% and 4.9% per annum respectively, compared to 2.3% per annum in Singapore. As for healthcare, prices increased by 3.1% per annum in the US, and 0.7% per annum in both the Eurozone and South Korea over this three-year period, which is faster than the 0.2% per annum increase in Singapore. The Government understands Singaporeans’ concerns over rising inflation and has provided targeted relief to lower-income households. We will continue to monitor prices closely."
"Based on salaries declared by employers at the point of initial employment of their foreign domestic workers (FDWs), the median basic monthly salary over the past three years is $560. FDWs who had prior work experience in Singapore receive about $20 more per month. We do not provide nationality-based data to avoid invidious comparisons. The data also does not capture the impact of salary adjustments for longer-serving FDWs. The basic monthly salaries of FDWs who were hired via the Eldercarer FDW Scheme vary from $400 to $1,000, with the median of about $570. The difference in median salaries should not be attributed solely to their Eldercarer training. It can also be a result of other factors, such as the type and length of training courses they have undergone, whether they had prior nursing training and experience, and the level of caregiving needs of the care recipients."
"Madam, I have three clarifications for the Acting Minister. The Acting Minister has said that there are some childcare centres that have innovative practices and ought to be retained. The fact remains that operationally, it has become impossible to operate at fees offered by anchor operators because of the huge set-up grants and operating grants they get. For example, I met this operator who is trained in special needs and wants to set up a centre in a neighbourhood centre but paying $45,000 monthly rent it is impossible for her to be near to the anchor operators' prices. And today in the newspaper, the YWCA director was quoted about the competition for staff from anchor operators, and that is one of the challenges that she faced. Question two is that in considering new anchor operators, I would like to request the Ministry to look at keeping the system open so that you can be bidding for clusters of sites when these clusters are available rather than to fix to two to three anchor operators at this time. The third clarification is that the Acting Minister showed some charts earlier and said that he wanted more mass market options. Now, to solve this problem, one possibility is for the Ministry to define the fee range for these sites and open it up for bidding so that you are actually in direct control of these fees because site availability and the high cost of rental is a huge problem for operators today."
"MOM and our Tripartite Partners take a practical approach towards supporting companies that are implementing remote work and other forms of flexible work arrangements. Specifically on remote work, employers are best placed to assess what types of work in the company are suitable for this form of flexible work arrangement, how best to implement it, retain their employees and motivate them, while ensuring the needs of the business are met. Mr Speaker, the Government should not overreach or be overly prescriptive. Otherwise, we stifle the spirit of free enterprise and entrepreneurship. Some employers may need financial support to implement the digital technologies to support remote work. The Government supports them through the Productivity Solutions Grant. The HR profession has also come together to share experiences and best practices. For example, the Institute for Human Resource Professionals developed a Playbook on Hybrid Workplaces. We will continue to consult closely with our Tripartite Partners to identify resources and tools to support companies in implementing remote work as well as other forms of flexible work arrangements. Employees who experience unfair treatment, including in performance assessment while on remote-work arrangements, can reach out to the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) for advice and assistance. The principles underlying the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices are clear. Remote work may be an emerging workplace practice, but the principle of fair and objective assessment remains unchanged."
"Mr Chairman, according to the Cyber Security Agency, there had been a spate of cyber attacks in Singapore over the past year. Investigations revealed that some attackers employed sophisticated anti-detection and infection techniques to access information through cyber backdoors. Some of these advanced persistent threats or APT had malware signatures that are unknown, even to the anti-malware databases. We have all heard from Defence Minister, Minister Ng Eng Hen, just earlier. He spoke about the threats that is posed by malware email. So these developments demonstrate that cyber threats to Singapore are becoming more sophisticated, making detection and forensic investigation more difficult. Notably, some of these sophisticated cyber attacks appeared to be targeted at public organisations in an effort to gain access to critical information and data. Not surprisingly, MINDEF was targeted by deliberate hacking attempt on its Internet-facing system early last year. Given our small population and geographical size, the SAF relies heavily on digitisation and networking on our capabilities to achieve a military edge against our potential adversaries. However, this military networks and systems and the sensitive information they contain make them an attractive target of cyber attacks. As part of the on-going efforts to strengthen its cyber defence capabilities, MINDEF recently announced the launch of a Cyber NSF Scheme to tap on cyber talent with the requisite aptitude and skills of the NSF pool. Can MINDEF provide and update on the recently announced Cyber NSF Scheme? How sustainable will the scheme be given the much talked about reduction in the population size thus a small number of NSFs available?"
"HDB takes a needs-based approach for households applying for rental flats. $1,500 is used as an indication of income, because first-timer households with this income are able to buy a new flat with the help of our generous housing grants, and we want to encourage them to own their own homes. But this income figure is a guideline, and not a hard cap. Households with income over $1,500 can still apply for rental flats. HDB will consider their individual circumstances to assess their housing budget and options. At the Committee of Supply earlier this year, MND shared that from 2016 to 2018, 590 households with incomes above $1,500 were assisted with public rental housing. Since then, from January to July 2019, about 170 more households have been assisted. HDB will continue to review the Public Rental Scheme regularly to ensure that it meets the housing needs of Singaporeans who are not able to purchase their own homes."
"Today, more than two in five CPF members have made a nomination. Among those aged 65 and above, three in four members have done so. The online nomination service was rolled out last year to make this process even more convenient for members. Since then, about half of nominations have been made online. CPF Board is notified by the Registry of Births & Deaths after the death of a member is registered, and typically distributes nominated CPF monies within a month of notification. For un-nominated CPF monies, CPF Board will pass the monies to the Public Trustee’s Office (PTO) within three weeks of notification of the member’s passing after accounting for transactions such as MediSave deductions for hospital bills. The PTO will trace and search for the eligible beneficiaries under the law and charges administrative fees for disbursement. Eligible beneficiaries may come forward at any time to make their claims. Upon the submission of the complete set of documents and information by the applicant, PTO usually disburses the un-nominated CPF monies within four weeks. To allow their CPF monies to be distributed to preferred beneficiaries faster and without incurring fees, we encourage all members to make their CPF nominations and update it as their life circumstances change. We will continue to regularly review our CPF policies to ensure they better meet members’ needs."
"Between FY2019 and FY2021, the Government collected about $1.3 billion of tobacco duties per year on average. The costs of smoking extend beyond the direct healthcare costs of smoking-related illnesses and also include indirect costs such as productivity losses for the economy. We take these costs into account in the setting of tobacco tax rates. Our aim is not so much to raise sufficient revenue to cover the costs of smoking, but to have an effective system of taxation that will reduce tobacco consumption and its accompanying negative effects. Taxes are also part of a broader multi-pronged approach to reduce the prevalence of tobacco use in Singapore, including through measures like public education, provision of smoking cessation support services, as well as the control of tobacco advertising and sales of cigarettes to minors. The Government regularly reviews the tobacco tax rate, including reviewing trends in smoking prevalence, to ensure its continued effectiveness in discouraging tobacco consumption."
"Mr Chairman, I know it is late now. It leaves me to thank the Minister Dr Ng Eng Hen as well as Senior Minister of State Mr Chan Chun Sing as well as Senior Parliamentary Secretary Dr Maliki for their very comprehensive replies to all the questions. I know that there are a lot more work that needs to be done to build up public confidence and the road ahead of us is still long. Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. The sum of $11,895,000,000 for Head J ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates. The sum of $440,000,000 for Head J ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates."
"MOE consciously ensures that we minimise loss of curriculum time and minimise inconvenience for parents without alternative caregiving arrangements. Aside from 12 weeks of school holidays per year, primary school students are notified in advance and do not report to school for another 12 days for PSLE marking, PSLE Oral and Listening Comprehension Examinations, school exam results processing and significant school events such as parent-teachers conference. Schools may dismiss students earlier on the eve of events such as National Day and Children’s Day. There are four such events in a year. For all these days, school-based student care centres remain open for students."
"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the items in the package are clear. I think we do not have to go through and reiterate those items. But we are not only enhancing or providing an additional support package in the areas that we had announced because we had also recently updated, some of our structural schemes, structural programmes that are helping the groups that Mr Edward Chia talked about. For example, we have recently enhanced our Home Caregiving Grant. Or for that matter, we have been continuing to update our subsidies and help for healthcare. Even as fees go up, healthcare costs go up, we continue to review and update these subsidies and programmes, including for the Pioneer Generation, for the Merdeka Generation. Even more recently, we had updated some of our structural schemes for Workfare and for ComCare assistance too. So, it is more than just what is in the package alone that is one off, providing targeted relief. We are also quite aware that there will be groups – the elderly, parents with special needs children – who will be finding it difficult to cope with higher prices. And for some of these groups, the way to go about helping them is not just a one-off relief, but to adjust our underlying funding for the various programmes to make sure that they keep pace with inflation and higher prices. This we will continue to do on a regular basis."
"Our public spaces are meant to be used and enjoyed by everyone. Apart from parks and park connector networks, we have progressively opened up reservoirs and waterways for sporting and recreational activities. Our parks are open to members of the public, including private outdoor education providers, as long as the activity does not deprive other public users of the space. Currently, for activities that are organised for more than 15 people, ticketed, or require structural set-up, members of the public can apply to use our parks through the online Park Usage Application System. NParks will allow activities that do not cause undue disruption to the public, or potential damage to flora and fauna in our parks. Users must also adhere to the rules and regulations stipulated in the Parks and Trees Act. Our reservoirs are restricted facilities. However, PUB will consider applications from private organisations to carry out water activities in our reservoirs on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the impact on PUB's operations, potential pollution to the water and surroundings, and safety of participants. We will continue to support the use of our public spaces by private outdoor adventure education providers, as long as the proposed activities do not compromise our agencies’ operations, and the impact to our environment and other members of the public is minimised."
"The Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) is the first point of contact for consumers who have disputes with retailers. CASE advises consumers on their rights and the possible courses of action that they may choose to take. The consumer can pursue the issue on his own or enlist CASE’s assistance. Consumers who want CASE to assist them can choose from a range of measures such as negotiation and mediation. CASE has a set of fees for its services, which is tiered depending on the extent of services provided and the value of the claims. The list of fees is published online on CASE’s website. Over the past five years, CASE has helped to clarify an average of about 15,500 consumer enquiries per year. In addition, CASE has assisted or counselled an average of about 8,600 consumer cases per year. Of these cases, about 20% obtain letters from CASE which set out the consumer’s rights, the case-specific concerns and resolution sought. The consumers use the letters to engage the retailers. Consumers pay CASE an administrative fee of $10.70 for this letter. Consumers may also choose to have CASE negotiate with the retailer on their behalf. As CASE is constituted as an association, it is only able to represent its members when dealing with the retailer. Consumers who become individual CASE members pay an annual membership fee of $26.75. Depending on the value of the claim, the consumer also pays an administrative fee which is tiered based on the value of the claim - ranging from $10.70 for claims of less than $5,000 to $53.50 for claims of up to $20,000; with an additional $53.50 for every $10,000 or part thereof above $20,000. CASE has not rejected any requests from consumers for assistance, except where the requests are beyond the ambit of consumer protection laws. These include business-to-business disputes, application for accident claims and investment contracts."
"Madam, just one supplementary question for the Senior Minister of State. Does the MOH currently benchmark the level of professional training, specifically for nursing home staff, such as ENs and nursing aides, with other countries that may have a best practice in this area, like Japan, for example, which I think is known for high standards for eldercare and care in nursing homes, to see if there is scope to further improve the level of training and the level of continuous training that nursing staff receive in Singapore nursing homes? I suspect the level of training is rather uneven at the present moment when we look at the nursing home space."
"Singapore is party to a number of major human rights treaties and conventions. For example, Singapore is party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, as well as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). More recently, Singapore ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in July 2013. On 19 November 2012, Singapore, together with other ASEAN Member States, affirmed our commitment to advance the promotion and protection of human rights in the region by adopting the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration. Singapore takes its treaty obligations seriously and prefers to become a party to Conventions when we are sure that we are able to comply fully with all of the obligations. Our focus is on the full and effective implementation of treaty obligations. We study international human rights instruments closely to understand the obligations that they impose on States party to them. If we accede to a treaty and yet make reservations that detract from the object and purpose of the treaty as a whole, it becomes an exercise in mere optics. That is not our approach. I should emphasise that even when Singapore is not a party to a particular treaty, it does not mean that, in practice, our policies are not already largely in compliance with the substance of its provisions."
"The National Environment Agency (NEA) commissioned a lifecycle assessment (LCA) study on carrier bags and food packaging in September 2016, in order to take an evidence-based approach to the issue of disposables in Singapore. It was conducted by Assoc Prof Kua Harn Wei from NUS School of Design and Environment (SDE) and his team of researchers from SDE and NUS Environmental Research Institute. NEA released a factsheet on the key findings in 2018. The key findings showed that every type of material, including bio-degradable and paper materials, imposed different environmental impacts, and that consumers can reduce their impact on the environment by opting to use reusable bags and food containers, instead of disposables. We therefore encourage the public to reduce the excessive consumption of all types of disposables and to use reusables where possible. NEA will work with NUS to release more information on the study, focusing on the methodologies and assumptions. This approach will enhance readability and ease of understanding by the general public. We will release the additional information when ready."
"I thank the Minister of State for his answer. In my interactions with my residents, I have come across residents who have recovered from a previous history of mental illness. They may have had a bout of depression when they were younger; they are now very well but, at the same time, they are afraid that if they declare this information to an employer, it may prejudice their employment prospects.  Likewise, I have also met residents who are on dialysis and worry that if the prospective employer becomes aware at an early stage, it may again prejudice their ability to have the job because of the time that needs to be taken out and the flexible work arrangements.  What plans does the Ministry have to continue building awareness of more enlightened Human Resource practices in the industry?"
"In the past three years, over 60% of drug abusers arrested are repeat offenders. This is a worrying trend. For repeat offenders, there is impact not only on the drug offenders, but also their family members who have already suffered previously. There is a tremendous emotional and financial strain on the spouse and the children of drug offenders. I have seen a few cases now in Nee Soon East, and some have been arrested and sent back to the Drug Rehabilitation Centres (DRCs) more than twice now. I fully appreciate that it is difficult to fight their addiction. However, with such high numbers of repeat offenders, are there any plans to improve the rehabilitation process at our DRCs and the employability of ex-drug offenders when they are released? Will additional resources be provided to the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE) to expand and increase their efforts?"
"The Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA) allows Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents (PR) to donate their kidneys, livers, hearts and corneas in the event of death, for the purpose of transplantation to save lives. In the situation where there are no suitable Singaporean or PR recipients, the organ will be offered to a foreign patient before the donated organs deteriorate. From 2004 to 2013, six foreign patients received HOTA corneas as there were no other suitable local recipients. The key objective of Singapore's National Blood Programme is to ensure that all patients in Singapore, regardless of nationality and residential status, have access to a safe and sufficient blood supply when they need it. Blood transfusions are given and prioritised based on clinical indications. The physician in charge decides whether a patient needs a blood transfusion and how much blood is required. The Health Sciences Authority and the Singapore Red Cross work in partnership to collect blood from altruistic donors on a voluntary, non-remunerated basis. Donors include Singaporeans, PRs and non-residents. This approach of altruistic donation and inclusive recruitment ensures that the transfusion needs of all patients in Singapore are adequately and safely met."
"I thank Dr Lim Wee Kiak for his questions. I think what Dr Lim is referring to is that there was a time where the prices of COEs between Category A and Category B were quite different. So, it was quite different in the past, and I hope that I can explain that a little bit further. But, over time, that gap has closed. So whether it is Category A or Category B, that gap has closed. One of the reasons why this has happened, as has been pointed out by many observers, is that increasingly you will find premium makes also in Category A. For example, in Category A you might find a Mercedes A class. And so there is a perception that there is some activity going on that is causing the premium makes to also push out cars. This is something actually very worth studying. One contributing factor is that worldwide, for environmental reasons, even premium makes are pushing out cars of smaller engine capacity. And this might have contributed to a closing of the gap between the Category A COE prices and the Category B COE prices. Dr Lim mentioned the example of a Lamborghini. I am afraid I really do not know what a Lamborghini costs, but I think the engine capacity of a Lamborghini would not put it in Category A."
"Thank you, Madam, and I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. Could I just ask whether there is a timeframe in terms of reviewing the effectiveness of the current surveillance cameras? I just did my home visits again and I still have the same feedback about the same debate that we had a few years ago, about how, when we put the surveillance camera there, it is good deterrence – people stopped littering or throwing out their cigarette butts. But the minute we remove the cameras, they start again. So, it is a cat-and-mouse game and it really is a waste of our current resources. Can NEA look into this; look into deploying smaller, more discreet cameras so that we can have more effective enforcement on the ground?"
"Mr Zainal Sapari asked for the top 10 courses, so here they are in descending order.  1) Use Basic Functions and Applications of a Computer;  2) Basic Computer Course in Chinese;  3) Use Primary Functions and Applications of a Tablet;  4) Private Hire Car Driver’s Vocational Licence;  5) Use Primary Functions and Applications of a Computer;  6) Follow Food and Beverage Safety and Hygiene Policies and Procedures;  7) Tablet Fundamentals;  8) Use Basic Functions and Applications of a Computer;  9) SkillsFuture@PA Chinese Restaurant Cooking (Elementary);  10) Beginner Workplace Literacy.  Members might have noticed some titles are the same because they are delivered by different training providers. A more meaningful way to look at it, is to cluster popular courses into certain sectors and look at the entire cluster. If we look from that perspective, the most popular area of training is still Information and Communications Technology (ICT) related courses.  Over the two-year period, about 62,000 claims were made by Singaporeans for these top 10 courses. Close to ninety percent of the participants are Singaporeans aged 40 and above.  However, it is difficult to ascertain if the training led to better jobs or new jobs. To drive those outcomes, we have specific schemes such as Professional Conversion Programmes (PCP), Place and Train, and Adapt and Grow where we monitor the progress of each and every trainee. Notwithstanding, one of the key objectives of the SkillsFuture Credit scheme in supporting the SkillsFuture Movement is to empower individuals to take ownership of their skills development, open up their minds to embrace a lifelong learning mindset and embark on the journey. Judging by the take-up and the types of courses most people enrolled in, we believe the scheme has achieved this objective."
"Mr Speaker, let me add a supplement to what the Member is asking. I think in adjudicating some of the compensation quantums, the Minister for Manpower will objectively look at the facts of the case because each case is different. There are cases in which employer may have to bear some responsibility and there are cases in which also the employee himself or herself has actually got to bear part of the responsibility for, perhaps, not communicating or not performing or not indicating his or her interest to further the re-employment contract. So, in that sense, we take into account a myriad of factors  performance of the employee, years of service and including other aspects of the job scope, what were the terms of re-employment that were being offered, whether it was a fair description of the job that a person can meaningfully carry on. The health status of the employee also has to be looked into because certain jobs will require a certain degree of medical fitness to continue. Therefore, it is not a one-size-fits-all type of calculation on the compensation amount. I hope that kind of gives the Member a sense of how we look at it in terms of the matrix. But the quantum would vary from case-to-case."
"Mr Speaker, as at end January 2023, there are 527 blocks 30 years and above eligible for the HIP but which are pending selection. Out of the 4,449 blocks selected for HIP since the programme’s inception in 2007, 102 blocks are below 30 years as at 2023. Generally, these blocks have been selected for HIP as they form a contiguous parcel with blocks that are 30 years and above. At the beginning of each Nomination Exercise to select blocks for the HIP, HDB will inform Town Councils (TCs) of the remaining precincts or blocks that are eligible and invite them to nominate a number of the eligible precincts and blocks, especially those that are aged 30 years and above, for HDB and the Ministry of National Development (MND)’s evaluation. In general, MND and HDB will accord priority to older flats, while ensuring that there is a good geographical spread of HIP projects across public housing estates."
"ComCare Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance (SMTA) provides temporary assistance to lower-income households that need financial support to meet basic needs. The assistance for about 1,800 households, or 12% of all households currently on SMTA, will end after September 2022. Some of these households will return to renew their assistance. Others will not, if their circumstances have improved and do not need more support. Reassessing the household’s circumstances when SMTA has ended ensures that ComCare resources are directed to where current needs are. In April this year, to tackle the rising cost of living, MSF introduced temporary measures to provide existing ComCare clients with a longer period of assistance at a higher quantum. These levels of assistance are similar to the revised rates. On a related note, SMTA clients whose circumstances changed and need more support than what they are receiving can approach their nearest Social Service Office (SSO). The SSO will reassess their financial situation, and adjust the quantum and duration of SMTA, if needed. MSF recognises the importance of making ComCare applications simpler and more convenient. Starting May 2022, applications for SMTA can be made more conveniently via the SupportGoWhere portal. Applicants can tap on “MyInfo” to fill in their personal information automatically and submit their documents and keep track of their application status online. Applicants who are unable to make online applications can continue to make their applications in person at the SSOs. The community plays an important role in partnering the Government to help those in need. Other than helping on their own, members of the community can also refer someone in need of assistance to call the ComCare hotline at 1800-222-0000, or approach their nearest SSO or Family Service Centre for assistance."
"HDB takes a needs-based approach in assessing requests for public rental flats, and the $1,500 income guideline is not a hard cap or ceiling. Individuals with income exceeding $1,500 can still apply for a public rental flat. HDB will evaluate each application holistically and consider factors such as whether the applicant has other housing options. The income thresholds across social assistance schemes differ as the schemes meet different needs and have different target groups. For the Public Rental Scheme, we use $1,500 as a guideline because first-timer households with this income are generally able to buy a new flat with the help of our generous housing grants, and we want to encourage them to own their own homes."
"Sir, I would support Mr Melvin Yong's proposal that we need to regularly review the deterrents that we have against such behaviours. As I have said, our policy position – and this is not just that of the Government but also that of the PTOs and the unions – the tripartite position is clear. We have zero tolerance for such abusive behaviours towards our public transport workers and if the existing measures are not adequate, we are prepared to look at reviewing them. But as it stands now, as Mr Melvin Yong pointed out, the trend is in the right direction. So, we will continue this approach of working closely together with our tripartite partners and also to promote a more gracious, considerate commuting culture. That, I think, is going to be key."
"Sir, I thank Ms Phua for the follow-up questions. Indeed, we want to strengthen support but the question is how. I think Ms Phua and many others will appreciate that the SPED space is not homogenous, with very varied challenges, very varied needs. When I describe things like the structures that we have or the 80% of students with special education needs in our mainstream schools, that is not a model. That is not a target. That is an outcome of the approach that we are taking. We currently have a space with a wide variety of service delivery models and a wide variety of structures. So, we have to take a little bit of a step back and have a sense that there really is no clear single answer about a single best model.  But there are some common challenges that we need to address in terms of strengthening our support. The biggest single challenge actually is professional capability. So, when we look at what we are doing now in our schools, the mainstream schools, the MOE-funded SPED schools, our VWO partners, the biggest single challenge is to not just have enough of the professionals but actually deepen the capabilities of those professionals. That is the biggest single focus of the work that we are doing. So, the answer to her first question is yes.  To the SPED Academy, it is something that we will seriously study, we are quite open to improving and updating and refreshing how we do the different models of SPED delivery. There is no single model of SPED delivery and we are quite open to studying further models."
"To deter outrage of modesty (OM), the Police conduct patrols at bus interchanges, train platforms, and on board trains. Police are also working with community volunteers through the Citizen on Patrol (COP) initiative to complement the patrols conducted by the Police. The Police will continue their efforts to educate and raise public awareness of OM. Advisories have been placed at prominent locations in the MRT stations, bus interchanges, on trains and buses. Police officers have been distributing advisories on OM to commuters. We urge victims to make a Police report as soon as possible. Reporting the crime early is crucial to help the Police identify and arrest the perpetrator. OM happens during both peak and off-peak hours, in roughly the same proportion. Hence, we urge commuters to be vigilant at all times. The percentage of OM cases involving male victims has remained relatively low over the past three years. The Police are monitoring the increase in OM cases and will regularly review their measures."
"ActiveSG, the national movement for sport, was launched in April 2014. We are encouraged to see a growing membership that stands at more than 980,000 today. Thus far, almost two thirds have started to utilise their $100 ActiveSG credits to book a sports facility or sign up for a sports programme. The ActiveSG credits were intended to encourage members to kick-start an active lifestyle and for them to experience the various sports facilities and programmes. Originally meant for a limited period, we announced in November last year that the credits will not expire so long as members continue to use them at least once a year. The $100 ActiveSG credits will be provided to new members who joined after 2015. We do not have any plans to top up the accounts of existing members. Sport Singapore is committed to ensuring that ActiveSG sports facilities and programmes are kept affordable to encourage Singaporeans to lead active lifestyles. For example, admission to swimming pools does not cost more than $1.50 on weekdays and $2 on weekends, whilst walk-in gym admissions cost $2.50. Several of the programmes organised by ActiveSG, such as Sundays @ the Park, are free. As part of the SG50 Seniors Package, we gave an additional top-up of $25 ActiveSG credits to ActiveSG members aged 55 years and above in 2015. This is on top of the $100 ActiveSG credits received by all new members. All senior citizens (aged 55 and above) who are ActiveSG members also enjoy special discounted rates for admission to our gyms and swimming pools."
"In 2008, we launched the Land Transport Master Plan (LTMP), with an ambitious target to raise our public transport mode share to 70% during the morning peak by 2020. Based on LTA's Household Interview Travel Survey (HITS) then, which was a comprehensive survey involving some 10,000 households, the public transport mode share was 59% in 2008. After some four years of implementing the LTMP, it is timely to take stock of our progress. Public transport ridership has increased significantly during this period, with daily public transport journeys growing from 3.62 million in 2008 to 4.14 million in 2012, a 14.4% increase. Hence, LTA is now in the midst of conducting another comprehensive travel survey, HITS 2012. With the results from HITS 2012, and our on-going public consultation to review the LTMP, we will provide an update to this House in due course on the current public transport mode share, as well as changes we intend to make to the LTMP to further improve this mode share, and to achieve our 70% target. This will include initiatives and projects to improve the coverage, capacity and reliability of our public transport system, such as expanding the MRT network, improving bus services and enabling greater public transport connectivity. I will announce our detailed plans after our review of the LTMP."
"Mr Chairman, we thank Assoc Prof Jamus Lim for agreeing with us on many things. Let me talk a bit more about how we want to catalyse R&D spending. In fact, indeed, it is very true. The Government cannot always be the one to decide which area of R&D spending that we want to do. Of course, there are areas of basic sciences that we will need to invest because there are very little commercial opportunities at that stage of development. But at the later stages of R&D development or for research and innovation, we will want to crowd in – as Minister Tan See Leng said – we would like to crowd in more private investments in this. And that is why there are different schemes for different parts of the R&D chain. Upstream, for basic science and technology, most of the funding will come, generally, more from the Government sources. But as we go downstream towards the innovation and commercialisation possibilities, we would have to crowd in more of this. That is why, as a strategy, as we go downstream, our funding of many of these initiatives, we would like to have a funding component that sees the private sector participation. The Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre (ARTC) is a good example. All the companies put skin in the game and the Government chipped in our part as well. This is how we crowd in the thing. The companies come together to define the R&D outcomes that they would like to see and they will also share the outputs that can be derived from the research effort. So, this is the kind of effort that we would like to encourage our private sector to work with the Government, especially in the downstream translation into commercial opportunities. So, it is not the same type of strategies across the entire different parts of the R&D chain. It is also not the same type of strategy for different types of R&D, ranging from biomed to deep-tech, to other e-commerce opportunities."
"Mr Chairman, I understand what Minister Lim Hng Kiang just mentioned about the pace. It is a matter of judgement. I just urge the Government to get a good pulse of the ground right. While I agree that we need to take the middle path for the reasons that the Minister mentioned, what we feel is the middle path may not be what the ground is feeling from the feedback that we have received. The feedback that I got may be wrong but maybe it is good to have some dialogue with some of the players both big and small companies to understand whether we are doing it at the right pace. I also mentioned that there are a few things happening at one time  restructuring, productivity drive, labour reduction and cost increases. The confluence of all these issues is also making it feel more a bit more painful. While restructuring at a certain pace is important, the other issues are creating a problem. It is a matter of judgement. I am not just saying the Government is wrong. I think it is best that we keep a close pulse to the ground, have more dialogues so that we get it, fine-tune along the way and do not make some mistakes and cause more pain."
"Madam, I find the comment rather unfair on the existing leadership or team working at SMRT. I have worked with them for one year now. I have been in the Ministry for one year. I spend a lot of time on the ground, talking to the people from top, senior level to the junior level, including many of the engineers, assistant engineers and technicians working their guts out in the trenches. I cannot speak for the previous leadership of SMRT but for the current team, they are taking this very seriously, not just BPLRT but the entire MRT network because they know that whatever they do or fail to do have major impact. As I said a couple of days ago, more than 2 million commuters use our service every day and we can make a difference to their lives. That is a very important function that we play. So, I am less interested in the past but on the way forward. And in fact, in the past few months, I believe that things are improving. I take trains, and many commuters come forward to express their direct experience because they are daily users of the service. Just last week, on a train, one Secondary school student came to me. He recognised me and he came for a chat. So, I asked, ""Do you use the train service every day?"" He said, ""Yes, every day. How else can I move around?"" I asked, ""Have you personally experienced disruptions?"" He said, ""Many."" I was very sad to hear that. So, I asked, ""When was your last disruption experience?"" He said, ""December last year."" I said, ""That means this year, things have improved?"" He said, ""Oh yes."""
"To encourage households to use electricity efficiently, electricity should be priced to reflect its full cost of production and delivery. This is our current approach, under which households pay for what they consume. Tiered electricity pricing may have inadvertent implications. For example, a multi-generational family will have to pay a higher rate if they live under the same roof versus living in separate homes. We encourage households to use electricity more prudently in other ways  (a) SP Services has been progressively replacing households' analogue (cumulative) electricity meters with advanced electricity meters, which allow households to track their electricity consumption through the SP Utilities Mobile App. This will help households better understand their electricity usage patterns and encourage them to be more energy-efficient. (b) NEA provides online resources to help households to adopt energy-saving habits. Households can also use the online Life Cycle Cost Calculator to select the most energy-efficient home appliances based on their life-cycle costs. (c) NEA and PUB launched the Climate Friendly Households Programme in November 2020 to encourage 1-room to 3-room HDB households to switch to energy- and water-efficient appliances. Each eligible household can redeem e-vouchers to offset their cost of purchasing LED lights, energy-efficient refrigerators and water-efficient shower fittings. We encourage all Singaporeans to adopt energy conservation as a way of life – from designing an energy-efficient home, to choosing energy-efficient appliances and adopting energy-saving habits."
"Chairman, on 22 March this year, two MRT maintenance staff were hit by a train near Pasir Ris MRT station and suffered fatal injuries. Several Members in this House including Minister Khaw Boon Wan, Minister Yaacob Ibrahim and Minister Masagos have visited the families to extend their condolences. Many questions popped up in my mind when I heard about the incident; I thought, ""How can this happen? How can a train hit the two staff who were walking in the second and third position in a single file on a designated walkway? Are there sufficient safety procedures? If not, why not? If yes, why were they not followed? Do we need 15 people on the tracks? Is it right to put trainees on the track during train operating hours? Is safety compromised because SMRT is pushing for shorter downtime?"" Over the next few days after the tragic accident, further details emerged and more questions came to mind, ""Why was the initial account of the incident different? How can we expect our maintenance crew to do a good job if they think their lives might be in danger?"" Chairman, for a system that runs on tracks, it is not acceptable to have any serious injury, especially fatal ones. Such incidents not only undermine public confidence in our train operators, but I am sure it would have deeply affected staff morale at SMRT and also affect its attractiveness as an employer for people looking for jobs. I understand that SMRT has completed its internal investigations into this incident and the report is being reviewed by an independent panel. Hopefully, this will answer the many questions which I have mentioned. The Ministry of Transport should take a comprehensive review of how our train operators carry out their maintenance work to ensure that such unfortunate incidents should never again happen. I also hope the Ministry of Transport will look into whether financial or other penalties should be imposed on SMRT and its management."
"Thank you, Mr Chairman, Sir. Just three clarifications for Minister Masagos Zulkifli. I will try and keep it short. Firstly, would the Ministry consider the proposal contained in my Budget speech to set a poverty line and measure the number of families, particularly, the number of children, who fall below this line every year so that we can measure how we are making an impact on the issue of poverty and transitioning people out of poverty? I note that some other countries do publish this data. Secondly, on the quantum of financial assistance, how often is this reviewed? When will the next review be and do these reviews take into consideration new research, such as the study by Prof Teo You Yenn and Dr Ng Kok Hoe that I referred to? Lastly, a narrow clarification. The Minister referred to our intergenerational social mobility being better than North America and Europe, if I heard him correctly. Could the Minister reference what is the study that demonstrates that? Because I am not aware of that."
"Mr Chairman, we do see some of these cases. There are not many of them, fortunately. But from time to time, we do have examples of home-buyers who, very unfortunately, during their waiting period, something happens to them before they could collect their keys. HDB tries to be as helpful as possible. One way is to see how best to support them still with the loan quantum. Even if their incomes have somewhat come down, so long as they have the means to service the loan, then we will try to, perhaps, even with lower incomes, still consider maintaining the same quantum or not reducing it so much, so that they can still afford the flat that they had earlier purchased. The qualification here is that we do not want, as I said earlier, to end up with them overstretching themselves and their finances. So, we will assess each individual case and see how best to support them, firstly, on the loan. Secondly, if truly, the circumstances are so dire that even with the help on the loan side, they cannot continue with the transaction, then we will assist to see if, perhaps, changing to a smaller flat might be a better option for this person or couple."
"Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) in nursing support mid-career Singaporeans who wish to enter the nursing profession. In the last three years, close to 300 locals underwent such programmes. About 40% of them were from non-nursing professions in the health and social services sectors. The other 60% come from a wide range of industries, such as manufacturing, finance and public administration. The PCPs for Registered Nurses at the Diploma and Degree level are accelerated programmes that allow mid-career individuals to complete their training in two years, compared to fresh school leavers who would take three years to do so."
"Mr Speaker, I thank the Minister of State for his answer. I have Clementi residents who were concerned at the news of what happened during the power outage. I have got two supplementary questions. Firstly, would the Minister of State consider, in hindsight, that the generator in use at the time constituted a single point of vulnerability? Because when a back-up generator is deployed as the main ongoing power supply, it is no longer a back-up system. Secondly, can the Minister of State advise the House on whether there will be a dedicated after action review (AAR), incorporating red team analysis of modes of vulnerability for our key infrastructure at checkpoints and that this will also look at areas, such as cyber risk, electrical supply risk, as well as network cable connectivity risk? Because a system may be compromised through many different possibilities and we have to secure our key infrastructure and checkpoints."
"Chairman, to tell the full story of a nation's history, it is not just the voices of important players which matter, but those of ordinary Singaporeans too. I would like to ask the Ministry how the National Library and Archives intend to reach out to ordinary Singaporeans to include their oral histories and capture footage of daily living. This will help preserve our heritage and also enrich the quality of our collections. Further, how are we increasing access to archival resources in our libraries to encourage greater understanding of our history and our culture?"
"Mr Speaker, I will deal with the last comment first. Is the Senior Minister suggesting that the WP is using these episodes for political purposes? The answer, I think, should be obvious. The answer is no, we do not do that. I appreciate the accolade because I think it is appropriate. In terms of the series of hypotheticals that the Senior Minister put out, I think moving from one extreme to another extreme is probably not the policy approach; hence, the earlier exchange we had about evolving the EIP to suit the needs of this current generation. But I hope it does not undermine or take away the point that philosophically, where does the WP want Singapore to go? And I do not think the PAP is very far away from this – that we all are trying to move towards a race-neutral society. We may have different approaches of going at it. We, of course, have the harder job of trying to second guess what is reasonable in the way we move there, because we do not have the information and the broad sweep of facts that the Government has. But I think, by and large, we accept that we have to move forward in a way where Singapore, as a country, as a society, is strengthened. That should make things clear."
"Data on the incomes of the top 1% of individual income earners is only collected by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS). However, individuals are only required to declare income that is taxable in their income tax returns. Income that is not taxable, such as capital gains, need not be reported to IRAS. Page  1154 At different points over the past 10 years, certain types of income have been exempted from tax. Comparison of declared incomes over the 10 years is, hence, not meaningful, as the income base would, in fact, differ. As the main exemptions from tax were introduced prior to Year of Assessment (YA) 2009, incomes from the past four years allow for a better comparison. Based on IRAS' records, the number of income earners in the top 1% grew from 29,524 in YA 2009 to 32,285 in YA 2012. The average taxable income of this group was $0.7 million in YA 2009 and YA 2012. Please refer to table below for the average income of the top 1% of income earners from YA 2009 to YA 2012.  Page  1154"
"I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply to my question. I wanted to find out whether it is possible for the deployment of Auxiliary Police officers to help educate cyclists and motorists at this moment and pending the review and improvements to the infrastructure. I have noticed that in certain areas where cyclists like to go to, they normally cycle in a group and occupy the entire left lane. It is causing danger to themselves and also to motorists on the roads. Often, I find there are arguments as to who has the right to the lane. I agree with my colleagues who spoke earlier; I think education is key. And so, pending the review, is it possible for LTA to look at public education and enforcement, to make sure all cyclists keep in one single row —   Yes, thank you. And just to keep to the extreme left lane."
"Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I appreciate the Senior Minister of State's reply. I just have one supplementary question, which is that, would the Government consider launching a whole-of-Government movement to simplify language in Government communications in a very concerted manner that is regularly reviewed. Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, could I just read out one sentence from a letter I received from a Government agency?   Yes. I received this letter from a particular agency and I am just going to read out this one sentence  ""We have reviewed your case and we regret to inform you that we are unable to accede to your request as the evidence supports the offence disclosed."" I do not mean to be too prescriptive but, for example, you could reword this and say, ""We have reviewed the facts and we are sorry that we cannot agree to your request because there is not enough proof."" This is an example. For many Singaporeans who receive Government communications, English may not always be their first language. So, I think my clarification is, would the Government consider implementing much more simplified communications in its letters and so on to Singaporeans, as a whole-of-Government effort."
"Mr Speaker, Sir, may I address Question Nos 19 and 20 in today's Order Paper and also Parliamentary Questions for oral answer filed by Mr Leong Mun Wai, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim and Ms Hazel Poa   Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked if we will review the safe management measures (SMMs), given that we have passed the peak of the Omicron wave. As the Member is aware, the relaxed rules came into effect on 29 March 2022, which is why we are all seated together today, and we have also transitioned to a Vaccinated Travel Framework on 1 April 2022. It is a decisive but calibrated move. We did not declare a Freedom Day nor did we declare the pandemic to be over, as some countries did. Taking a cautious step-by-step approach has served us well throughout the pandemic and we will continue to do so. That said, we were able to make this decisive move as we observed that the number of daily cases had been steadily declining in recent weeks. More importantly, the number of severe cases needing to be hospitalised had also declined. It is in this context that the Multi-MinistryTask Force (MTF) assessed the further easing of our SMMs and resumption of many normal activities to be appropriate. These relaxations will likely cause an uptick in daily cases, which we should be able to ride through without any major changes to our public health posture. Once cases subside further, we will consider further easing of the SMMs. This can include reviewing distancing rules between tables in F&B settings that Mr Liang Eng Hwa specifically raised, and I want to assure Mr Liang that I am aware that one metre versus 80 centimetres makes a huge difference to F&B establishments. It also makes a huge difference in terms of transmission. So, we have to weigh the costs and benefits."
"Sir, last month, the Government announced that it is planning to build a dedicated telecoms network for public sector use, as part of the Smart Nation push. Instead of leasing connectivity, as is usually the case now, the Government will own the network backbone infrastructure. IDA said this is to provide a platform that is secure and trusted to safeguard potentially sensitive information used across multiple Government agencies. Sir, there are many security and privacy mechanisms that can be put in place to prevent unauthorised access by both outsiders and insiders. Just because a network is owned by the Government does not, in and of itself, make it more secure than if it were owned by private entities. In any case, the Government plans to commission private sector telcos to operate this dedicated network on its behalf, so they will still have access to it as well. The other reason cited is that the Government wants to build a common infrastructure to support the deployment of Smart Nation applications. Can this not be achieved by expanding the capacity and resiliency of existing infrastructure? I am not sure if these reasons justify the cost to the public purse of building a dedicated network. Can the Minister share what is the estimated cost of building this dedicated telecoms network? How will the Government ensure that this dedicated network does not end up with excess capacity while the public networks become increasingly clogged? And lastly, can we be sure the Government will not sell away its telecoms network infrastructure to private enterprises in the future, like what happened to OpenNet, which was sold to a Singtel-owned company in October 2014?"
"As part of our greening efforts, we have safeguarded approximately 7,800 hectares of nature reserves, parks, and park connectors in Singapore. In the next 10 to 15 years, we will add another 1,000 hectares of green spaces. Of these, more than 200 hectares will be set aside for new nature parks, which serve as important buffers to protect our core biodiversity sites. Some of these nature parks are located near residential estates, such as Bukit Batok Hillside Nature Park and Khatib Bongsu Nature Park. Besides extending our network of nature parks, we also plan to bring more green spaces into our neighbourhoods. By 2030, every household will be within a 10-minute walk from a park. In planning for our green spaces and identifying suitable plots of land that can be converted into parks, we take into account other land-use needs such as community facilities, public amenities, and infrastructure, and seek to balance the demand for green spaces with these needs. We also consider factors such as ecological significance and connectivity, as part of our science-based approach towards nature conservation. In line with this approach, NParks launched the island-wide Ecological Profiling Exercise (EPE) in February 2021, to map the ecological profile of green spaces in Singapore, in consultation with the nature community and experts. Findings from the exercise will guide our long-term land-use plans in identifying key biodiversity sites for conservation and support our greening efforts."
"Again, just to be clear, section 30 clause 3 is not intended to deal with judicial review. It is to deal with the Minister's position being final, which is the position today – final in the sense that you cannot appeal on the facts for a different view of the facts to another body. That is what it is meant. And if you look at the cases, that is the legal position. It is not intended to touch on judicial review, on the classic principles that had been set out. As to why we have set out in the Schedule, it is precisely for the reason that the Member has said, to put some constraint and put it out clearly which legislation. It may act as constraint but it is also clear and it is better."
"These engagements involve organising roundtable sessions to gather feedback first hand from companies including local SMEs on their business interests and the issues they face. Where there are specific concerns or opportunities companies are keen on, MTI and our economic agencies have also undertaken one-to-one sessions to follow up on these issues. In addition, IE Singapore's FTA promotion and advisory team conducts market surveys that allow companies to provide detailed feedback on their business interests and specific areas of concern. These efforts are complemented with FTA outreach efforts to help companies gain greater awareness and knowledge of how FTAs can be used to their benefit. Some 3,500 companies over the last five years including SMEs from diverse sectors have benefited from workshops and seminars aimed at equipping companies with a better understanding of Singapore's trade agreements."
"We are aware of recent reports of sales persons attracting passersby to their booths by using offers of free gifts and thereafter marketing certain products to them. If consumers have reason to believe that these suppliers have engaged in practices such as pressure-selling or false claims, they can approach the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) with details of these practices for CASE to assist them in seeking redress from the suppliers. The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act (CPFTA) provides consumers protection against unfair practices such as false claims and pressure selling. Under the CPFTA, CASE can invite suppliers to cease their unfair practices through a Voluntary Compliance Agreement. The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore, as the administering agency of the CPFTA, is also empowered with investigation and enforcement powers to take action against errant retailers which persist in unfair practices. Consumers are also encouraged to take pre-emptive measures to protect themselves against unfair practices. For example, they can check the reputation of the supplier, ask questions about the products and examine the products before making the purchase. CASE will also continue to educate consumers to be alert to the free gifts sales tactics through its outreach efforts."
"Chairman, Singaporeans are now spending more time online, which means they are more open to online content – and some content may hold extreme or even extremists views – online gaming and possible gambling as well as engaging in social media that may not be able regulate all of its contents. Different segments of the community may be exposed to varied levels of online harms. The youths, for example, are most susceptible to negative influences like cyberbullying, hate comments or even online shaming. The elderly, too, are not spared from being cyber victims. I welcome the Alliance for Action to tackle online harms, especially those targeted at women and girls. What are some targeted measures that MCI will put in place to protect the different segments of Singaporeans from varied forms of online harm?"
