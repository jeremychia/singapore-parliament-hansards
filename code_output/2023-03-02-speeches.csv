2023-03-02,Annual Values as of 2022 Used to Determine Eligibility for Social Support Schemes in 2023,014-001-095-090-001,Mr Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance with the revision of Annual Values (AV) of most residential properties in 2023 (a) what are the communication plans to seniors that social support schemes will not be affected by this revision, as AVs as of 2022 will be used to determine scheme eligibility in 2023; and (b) what are the plans for scheme eligibility for 2024.",1,1,014-001-095-090-001-001,1
2023-03-02,Annual Values as of 2022 Used to Determine Eligibility for Social Support Schemes in 2023,014-001-095-090-001,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance),"  Mr Speaker, MOF had earlier issued a media statement to explain that the criteria for the Government’s social support schemes in 2023 will not be affected by the latest Annual Values (AVs) revision, as the AVs as of 2022 are used to determine scheme eligibility. We are also working with the Silver Generation Office (SGO) to engage seniors and provide them this assurance.",1,2,014-001-095-090-001-002,2

Just two supplementary questions. How will the Government monitor and encourage seniors who are eligible in 2023 to continue to apply for social support that needs application, as some may not know? And two, how much lead time will the Government give to let seniors and their families know the scheme eligibility in 2024?",1,6,014-001-095-090-001-006,6
2023-03-02,Annual Values as of 2022 Used to Determine Eligibility for Social Support Schemes in 2023,014-001-095-090-001,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"  Sir, these are ongoing engagements and communications with our seniors. Part of it, we will go through the Silver Generation Office. The face-to-face interactions between our Silver Generation Ambassadors and the seniors would be helpful, to explain to them some of these schemes and what they are eligible for. We also rely on other means of communications, including the mass media.",1,7,014-001-095-090-001-007,7
2023-03-02,Disbursements for National Productivity Fund,014-001-095-090-002,Mr Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the pattern of funding from the National Productivity Fund (NPF) by industry in the past five years; (b) whether the NPF uses research to benchmark Singapore's productivity according to sectors with other developed countries and when deciding how much to fund each sector; and (c) whether NPF is also funding initiatives undertaken by trade associations and business chambers in addition to Government agencies.,1,1,014-001-095-090-002-001,8
2023-03-02,Disbursements for National Productivity Fund,014-001-095-090-002,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"  Mr Speaker, Sir, over the past five years, the National Productivity Fund (NPF) has disbursed over $1 billion across 47 projects relating to productivity improvements and continuing education and training (CET). About half was spent on productivity improvement projects and the other half was spent on CET programmes.",1,2,014-001-095-090-002-002,9
2023-03-02,Disbursements for National Productivity Fund,014-001-095-090-002,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Some of the larger projects funded by the NPF include sector-specific schemes like the Construction Productivity and Capability Fund, as well as schemes that support enterprise and workforce transformation like the Inclusive Growth Programme and the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit scheme. Projects supported by NPF complement our wider range of schemes and projects in driving productivity improvements.",2,3,014-001-095-090-002-003,10

For example, to identify suitable interventions for greater productivity in the retail and food services sectors, productivity benchmarking studies were commissioned on industry performance and efficiency in areas such as labour and space, in Singapore and overseas.",3,4,014-001-095-090-002-004,11
2023-03-02,Disbursements for National Productivity Fund,014-001-095-090-002,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"The design and implementation of projects are done in close collaboration and/or consultation with trade associations (TACs) and the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i). Working with the relevant TACs helps ensure that initiatives are designed to meet the needs of the industry. For example, the Hotel Innovation Committee (HIC), in an effort led by the Singapore Hotel Association (SHA) and supported by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB), steered the sector to adopt technology solutions to raise productivity.",4,5,014-001-095-090-002-005,12

2023-03-02,Disbursements for National Productivity Fund,014-001-095-090-002,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"  I thank the Minister of State for her reply. Just a few supplementary questions. Firstly, to confirm my understanding, does the NPF restrict its funding to other Government agencies, to support the projects that those agencies are running, or is the NPF also open to funding TACs, business chambers or even individual companies for their productivity enhancement efforts?",1,8,014-001-095-090-002-008,15
2023-03-02,Disbursements for National Productivity Fund,014-001-095-090-002,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"The second supplementary question is, is the approach taken by the NPF more proactive or reactive, or is it a blend of both? Meaning to say that, can any organisation pitch a project to the NPF to request funding or is it the case that the NPF is not really open to that sort of modus operandi and they will just determine what sectors or what projects they want to do in any particular year?",2,9,014-001-095-090-002-009,16
2023-03-02,Disbursements for National Productivity Fund,014-001-095-090-002,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"And thirdly, I am wondering if the NPF makes easily available online a statement of its objectives, its KPIs, its strategies, maybe a review of what it has done in the past year. Many Statutory Boards and agencies do have their annual reports online where the CEO will talk about the agencies' priorities, what they did in the previous year, what their goals are for the coming year and so on. I found it quite difficult to search for this information – and I stand corrected if I just did not try hard enough – and I only found some information on the NPF for 2010 and 2017. For 2017, I was able to find the annual report; it is a very brief annual report and I found it through the National Archives website, actually. So, I was just wondering if this information is easily available and if not, will it be made easily available, going forward, given the tremendous amount of funding that is going into the NPF?",3,10,014-001-095-090-002-010,17
2023-03-02,Disbursements for National Productivity Fund,014-001-095-090-002,Mr Speaker,  Two on observations. Please keep it concise and a reminder to try to keep it to two supplementary questions. Do not sneak in a third one.,1,11,014-001-095-090-002-011,18

2023-03-02,Disbursements for National Productivity Fund,014-001-095-090-002,Ms Low Yen Ling,Mr Leon Perera and Members would remember that the NPF was set up in 2010 to support programmes relating to productivity enhancement as well as Continuing Education and Training (CET). It came about because of the Economic Strategies Committee (ESC). It was part of the wider push for productivity growth arising from the ESC recommendations.,2,13,014-001-095-090-002-013,20

At this juncture, let me share one number, for a sense of our overall progress in productivity improvements. Our labour productivity growth rate was 2.6% per annum in the last five years, prior to COVID-19. This is consistent with the target growth rate of 2% to 3% set in 2010 when the NPF was set up.",8,19,014-001-095-090-002-019,26
2023-03-02,Disbursements for National Productivity Fund,014-001-095-090-002,Ms Low Yen Ling,"The Member also asked about TACs. The work of the ITM is such that the sector agency cannot create policies in isolation. We have to work with the TACs because they play a very important role, advocating for the sector, bridging the communication with the sector and connecting the sector together, being a voice for the sector. The TACs are very involved.",9,20,014-001-095-090-002-020,27

STB works closely with SHA to bring that about. That is really how we get buy-in to level up the productivity across the sector, sector by sector and in fact, sub-sector by sub-sector.

The companies that are interested can certainly approach the sector agencies or even the TACs that might be involved. I want to share with him that the funds from the NPF are used to support meritorious productivity and CET schemes. Each of the project will have different criteria to meet, whether it is the vertical sectoral-specific ones or the horizontal ones.",11,22,014-001-095-090-002-022,29

The plan was completed in March 2022, just last year, with a $1.36 million of grant disbursed for a duration of 2016 to 2022.

I will not bore you with the details but I will highlight how it has done so. It embarked on more than 40 projects at group level to encourage our hotels to develop centralised systems in areas like IT, HR, property management, customer management, and also to adopt shared services such as group level branding and marketing.

I want to assure him that within the NPF, we regularly monitor the progress of the project that is funded by NPF to ensure they meet project level targets.

Because, if you are allowed to hire more of these work pass and S Pass holders, by definition, would your local workforce share not go down at the end of that two-year period?

I am glad that Senior Minister of State Khor has told us that the rentals do not make up the bulk of the cost and prices of cooked food for the stalls in hawker centres. I think she mentioned that it is only about 9%. But the challenge will be for the many people who are out there, they will now think, are the hawkers now profiteering as a result of it?",2,244,014-001-095-090-006-244,316

Can Senior Minister of State Khor share a little bit more. Apart from what we already know, how we can ensure that price increase of cooked food in future does not outpace the inflation rate that is in the market? For all the cooked-food stalls that are under the direct rental with NEA, will NEA consider asking them to at least provide a budget meal in some form or the other, even though they are not the Socially-conscious Enterprise Hawker Centres?",3,245,014-001-095-090-006-245,317

I think we are trying our very best, resourcing our farmers with funding, helping them with technology adoption. We have seen some early success of this, where some of our fish farms, for example, are taking on more productive methods using recirculating aquaculture systems  floating on the sea, rather than just using the seawater as it is, but filtering and actually creating a more conducive environment within the tanks for the fish to be grown in a more dense manner, yet kept in a very safe and very humane way to allow the tonnage to be much more intense.",6,261,014-001-095-090-006-261,333

Data that my volunteer team and I had painstakingly gathered suggest that hawker food in Anchorvale, the division of Sengkang that I represent, is significantly more expensive compared to more mature estates by an average of around 50 cents. One reason for this is that there are simply less coffee shops and hawker centres in newer estates. Hawker centres are a unique feature of our heartlands and in many mature towns, these often become focal points for the neighbourhood, together in the source of affordable sustenance for families. Yet, in the whole of Sengkang, there has only been one hawker centre and it is not even an NEA-run one, at least thus far.",2,120,014-001-095-090-007-120,492

In a nutshell, the top bidder in the auction still wins, but the price is set at that of the second highest bid.

To begin, we need to bring the community together including schools, merchants, hotels and community leaders to curate signature concepts that enables raising awareness of the heritage, providing education for more locals while we continue to tout these as tourist destinations.

Singapore’ sea space is almost as large as our land space.

However, a number of recent marine EIAs were not made available online. Instead, members of the public had to make appointments to view these reports, which can span hundreds of pages, in person during office hours. Singapore’s marine areas will face more pressures due to developments in our aquaculture sector and coastal protection measures.

It is a way of growing plants and food using nature-based regenerative methods, based on the ethics of “Earth care, People care and fair share”. It is a permanent form of agriculture which can be sustained indefinitely. It lowers the carbon footprint of food production and at the same time helps the soil used for agriculture to capture carbon from the environment.

2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),014-001-095-090-007,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Second, we have significantly increased the supply of BTO flats.

Let me explain because the process is not straightforward.,16,376,014-001-095-090-007-376,748
2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),014-001-095-090-007,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),I will speak about land preparation while my colleague Senior Minister of State Tan Kiat How will talk about HDB's productivity and innovation journey to build flats that are much taller than before and more comprehensive than in the past.,17,377,014-001-095-090-007-377,749
2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),014-001-095-090-007,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Sir, we have land for housing, but many of these are not large tracts of undeveloped greenfield sites that we can readily move into today. Land preparation is a long and complex process. For greenfield sites, we need to ensure that supporting infrastructure like roads and sewers are ready and conduct extensive soil investigations. For brownfield sites, we may need to relocate existing users, clear existing structures and divert services underground, such as cables and sewers.",18,378,014-001-095-090-007-378,750
2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),014-001-095-090-007,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"We also pay special attention to the ecological and heritage significance of sites to ensure that we develop sensitively and sustainably.

2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),014-001-095-090-007,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"So, a lot of forward planning and preparation is required before we can even begin construction – about five to 10 years of lead time, or even more in some cases.",21,381,014-001-095-090-007-381,753

2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),014-001-095-090-007,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"So, when housing demand rose during the pandemic, we were able to tap on these sites meant for Shorter Waiting Time flats, and bring forward their launch dates and offer them in BTO exercises to meet immediate demand.",25,385,014-001-095-090-007-385,757
2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),014-001-095-090-007,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"After we address the current supply crunch, we will get back on track to launch more Shorter Waiting Time flats from 2024 onwards.

2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),014-001-095-090-007,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Among this diverse group, we need to give stronger support to younger married couples and parents.

2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),014-001-095-090-007,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"We fully recognise this. Having a home of their own will provide a stable environment for newly married couples to set up their families, and parents want to give their young children a conducive environment. These young married couples and parents also probably have shorter work experience, so they might not have sufficient savings to afford other housing options at the time.",33,393,014-001-095-090-007-393,765

2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),014-001-095-090-007,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),This is so that we can provide more targeted support for families who want to secure their first home quickly and settle down.,36,396,014-001-095-090-007-396,768
2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),014-001-095-090-007,The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"That said, HDB may exercise flexibility on a case-by-case basis, if there are extenuating circumstances. For example, I have met adult children who have added themselves as co-owners to their parents' flat so that they could help their parents cope with the mortgage to keep their homes. They tend to come from lower-income families.

2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),014-001-095-090-007,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,"The second one is with the first-timer families, because they are those who have disposed of their private property or even a non-subsidised HDB flat, they because of financial reasons will have a need to go for subsidised flat now. So, what is the rationale for only prioritising the first-timers or those who we think have never owned or sold any local residential property before?",2,853,014-001-095-090-007-853,1225
2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),014-001-095-090-007,Mr Desmond Lee,  I thank the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) Chair for the two questions. We are in a situation where demand is high for the various reasons that we have articulated during the Housing Motion. We have ramped up supply but we hear from the various Housing Conversations under Forward Singapore that there is a group of Singaporeans who are undertaking their very first home ownership journey  younger people who have just graduated who just started work looking for their very first home.,1,854,014-001-095-090-007-854,1226

2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),014-001-095-090-007,Mr Desmond Lee,"On the second question, why did we scope the First-Timer Parent and Married Couple subcategory to exclude those who had formerly owned or sold property. This is to enable us to achieve our aim of giving additional support to those who are buying their very first home. This would tend to be younger people who are just starting out, they may not have worked long enough to accumulate the resources or gain the incomes that older, more experienced Singaporeans have in getting more housing options. And so, helping them in this way allows them to get their very first home. So, those who had previously bought and sold properties would probably have more means. That is a broad proxy. But I hear the Member that they may be extenuating circumstances and I did say that HDB will look at families in extenuating circumstances.

First, why is the $1,500 figure still mentioned on the website? What is the purpose of it? And secondly, in our experience residents have been turned away from the scheme because their income exceeded that threshold. So, could he share some information with us about the flexibility HDB has exercised? For example, how many households have they approved to go onto the public rental scheme that have exceeded this income ceiling, or some other data for us to understand the flexibility aspect better?",2,861,014-001-095-090-007-861,1233

So, your income will be used to assess your housing budget and option. I quote, ""we do not reject or accept applicants based purely on income. Applications are reviewed holistically taking into account household size and individual circumstances."" And that is what we have done.

We hope to exercise some investigative powers because, today, quite a lot of what the grassroots as well as what some Government agencies' officers are able to do, they cannot get very far if there is no consent given by the person who is suspected of making noise. Of course, today, there are also no powers to ask the person to cease and desist from making noise, pending satisfactory mediation or otherwise resolution of the case.

Firstly, maybe the Minister can share his considerations in deciding whether or not to grant this, because similar to the granting of the resale grants for singles, we are looking at quite a specific group of individuals rather a broad-based grant being given and it is really those who are eligible for the PPHS and PRS but, yet, are unsuccessful in their application. Secondly, in the absence of which, should the open market kind of HDB rentals not kind of tame itself in the manner which the Minister described, once the people who are renting get the keys to their BTO units, whether or not the Government will consider intervening in the market just so that the rents do not get so out of hand.",1,877,014-001-095-090-007-877,1249

2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),014-001-095-090-007,Mr Desmond Lee,"  Mdm Chairman, I think both Ms Mariam Jaafar and Mr Gerald Giam had asked similar questions whether the Government can prevent private property owners from holding on to their HDB flats, that means, they bought HDB and they now bought private, or we stop them from renting out their flats. As I have said previously in response to some Parliamentary Questions, we are studying this issue. Of the home owners who own private properties while being HDB flat owners, half of this group rent out their HDB flat.",1,885,014-001-095-090-007-885,1257

2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),014-001-095-090-007,Ms Tin Pei Ling,"  Thank you. I have two questions. One is that as we push for more flexible work arrangements, including work-from-home, I am wondering whether MND is looking at how we can enhance or redesign the living environment to better enable this, because one of the feedback is that, sometimes, there is not enough space or it is too noisy for that. Secondly, as the country continues to develop and we also talk about trying to preserve more green spaces for those who love nature, what is the Government's take on the more brownfield kind of sites? How are we going to develop or redevelop those while taking into consideration that some of these sites actually do have emotional attachments that people will have towards them like homes, like flats? I would like to get the Minister's position on this.",1,888,014-001-095-090-007-888,1260

2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),014-001-095-090-007,Mr Desmond Lee,"As I have shared previously, we are looking at the possibility of HDB housing design where we have more open plan flexibilities for the owner. Already, we have pushed the structural elements of each flat as far as possible to the outer perimeter of the flat. So, you try to avoid having structural beams and columns within the flat, which make it difficult for the homeowner to adjust the interior of the flat. So, more dry walls. But, all in, push the structural elements to the outer perimeters of the flat.",2,891,014-001-095-090-007-891,1263
2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),014-001-095-090-007,Mr Desmond Lee,"But going further, HDB is studying whether it would be useful to give different configurations for the same flat typologies  5-room, 4-room, 3-room. But instead of having the typical standard kind of room configurations, to allow some options, including providing options for people to configure a small workspace if necessary.",3,892,014-001-095-090-007-892,1264

2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),014-001-095-090-007,Mr Desmond Lee,"But, already, as the Member may have noticed in the media, we are experimenting with different things, even putting work modules that some companies are piloting at the bottom of the flats in the void decks, with WiFi and other facilities to see whether that is something that Singaporeans take to. Libraries as well as CCs have during COVID-19 and some continued well after the COVID-19 pandemic to offer such spaces for Singaporeans to work away from office. And, of course, there are the private sector co-working spaces that are found in different parts of Singapore. And we are studying with them the kinds of subscription to these kinds of models.

2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),014-001-095-090-007,Ms Indranee Rajah,"She has identified something where we need to maintain a balance. We have got green spaces. There are brownfield sites. At the same time, there is heritage. And in the early days, where it was largely just greenfield, it was not an issue. You just expanded into the green spaces. But now, we find that that is becoming increasingly scarce and we have to try and make sure that we preserve green spaces. But at the same time, there is a need for development. So, we have got to balance the two.",2,897,014-001-095-090-007-897,1269
2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),014-001-095-090-007,Ms Indranee Rajah,"But brownfield sites are actually quite exciting. They are exciting because it gives you an opportunity to redevelop and build on something which exists. And the big thing now for anybody who is in the infrastructure space is how do you take something which is an existing building and make it sustainable. And there are a lot of technologies and solutions that are going into this so that you actually turn something which is brown green again. Then, you may also have to tear down something which is existing and build afresh on it, redevelop it. And when you do that, that is when I think some of us, depending on the building, its location and what it was associated with, then you may lose some of the heritage and that cultural association.",3,898,014-001-095-090-007-898,1270
2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),014-001-095-090-007,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, we have to have a good balance and we assess the buildings and the site. And if there is a heritage value, then we have to see whether you preserve the whole thing or whether you might have to redevelop it but you preserve some parts of it, for example, the old Police Academy where we are going to have residential buildings. But we did not want to raze it completely. So, we consulted, we got public feedback. We also spoke to the old Police officers who had gone through the Police Academy.

I know this because in my area, at Tiong Bahru, I have a number of flats which fall into that category. But when you look at the stairs, some of them are curving stairs, and then, the flat stairs are very steep.

I really would appreciate more clarity on NParks' strategy and proactive approach to managing this more harmoniously in our City in Nature vision, both for the safety of humans as well as animals. Is there a step plan or framework in place to preempt hotspots or deescalate conflict, and can more thoughtful design of estates, for example, those near waterways or set in nature, such as Tengah?

EV chargers are being installed in HDB multi-storey car parks and public spaces to provide accessible charging infrastructure across the island. Working backwards from the 2040 target for 100% cleaner EVs, what is the expected annual expenditure required for installing and maintaining EV charging infrastructure and the cost of additional substations needed to meet the higher power load?",1,15,014-001-095-090-008-015,1367
2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport),014-001-095-090-008,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),Are there plans to recover part of the development expenses required for EV charging infrastructure from charging fees levied on drivers of EV cars? And what will be the considerations for the charging fee model for EV chargers installed in public premises? What are the plans for existing petrol and diesel pump stations as more drivers switch to EVs?,2,16,014-001-095-090-008-016,1368
2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport),014-001-095-090-008,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"  Madam, the availability of reliable EV charging stations is crucial to our transition to green vehicles. What has been the average utilisation rate for current public EV charging stations? New charging stations will be rolled out in all HDB carparks. How many EV vehicles and motorcycles can these additional EV stations in each HDB carpark support?",1,17,014-001-095-090-008-017,1369
2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport),014-001-095-090-008,Prof Koh Lian Pin (Nominated Member),"  Mdm Chair, electrifying Singapore’s vehicle population is a key goal of the Singapore Green Plan 2030. The Government has introduced a series of initiatives to encourage and support EV adoption. Can the Government provide an update on some of the key initiatives, including the EV Charging Act and the EV Common Charger Grant? Are we on track in terms of the rate of EV charger deployment and EV adoption?",1,18,014-001-095-090-008-018,1370
2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport),014-001-095-090-008,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"  Madam, the current formula for road tax for EVs consists of two components. The first requires a computation based on car’s power rating.",1,19,014-001-095-090-008-019,1371
2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport),014-001-095-090-008,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The second is a figure to be added, called the additional annual fixed component (AAFC). The AAFC is fixed from this year as $700 per year. This has caused some unhappiness among EV owners due to the weakness of the principle behind imposing the AAFC.",2,20,014-001-095-090-008-020,1372

2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport),014-001-095-090-008,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"As ICE vehicle users paid fuel excise duties at the pump, but EV users did not, AAFC was added to put both categories of vehicle users on par. MOT stressed then that the AAFC was not punitive but was an interim measure. However, some EV owners find it punitive as the AAFC arbitrarily raises their road tax by as much as one-third despite the whole-of-Government avowed push towards green policies and clean energy.",4,22,014-001-095-090-008-022,1374
2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport),014-001-095-090-008,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"I understood from the Budget Statement in 2020 that the end game for road tax on EVs is distance-based charging using the next-generation Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system. However, in a Parliamentary answer to Member of Parliament Mr Louis Chua in 2021, the Government stated that it was studying different approaches and options for distance-based charging that were fuel independent. Would the Ministry clarify what this means exactly?",5,23,014-001-095-090-008-023,1375

2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport),014-001-095-090-008,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"But we need to peel the onion further to understand the composition of the EVs registered last year. In particular, we hope MOT can reveal how many of the EVs were registered as passenger cars under COE Cat A and Cat B respectively. How many of the EV-registered vehicles were commercial vehicles and motorcycles?",3,26,014-001-095-090-008-026,1378

What is the Government's plan to adopt EVs across the different Government departments? Is there a centralised plan or is each Ministry responsible for their EV adoption or conversion plan by themselves?",5,28,014-001-095-090-008-028,1380
2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport),014-001-095-090-008,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"Meanwhile, we know that there is an overwhelming majority of public buses that are running on diesel engines. Is LTA accelerating the purchase of electric buses? How many electric buses is LTA buying this year and next year? What are the challenges in running electric buses? Are electric buses more costly to acquire and run? If so, will that translate to higher bus fares?",6,29,014-001-095-090-008-029,1381
2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport),014-001-095-090-008,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"On the other hand, there are also opportunities to run EVs at the airport and seaport as the range anxiety is less of an issue in the confined space of the airports and seaports.

2023-03-02,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport),014-001-095-090-008,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"One of the common feedback received is to enhance the connectivity of the feeder services serving Kaki Bukit to wider parts of Bedok North, Bedok South and also Bedok Reservoir by introducing Townlink feeder service. Such a service can be found in some HDB towns such as Pasir Ris. Many who had called for this mentioned that such Townlink feeder service will, in particular, benefit groups with different mobility needs, such as the elderly, persons with disabilities and families with young children because it will do away with the hassle of bus transfers.",4,35,014-001-095-090-008-035,1387

But these issues can be targeted in other ways and not just by constricting the number of motorcycles.

The fact here is that it is the motorcycle traders and sellers that overwhelmingly offer in-house financing. In some cases, the interest-bearing component of such loans can be oppressive for our motorcyclists. High COE prices mean motorcyclists will require more financing to buy motorcycles. There have been concerns expressed about how the prospect of offering such financing in and of itself provide an opportunity to profit from financing, even if a motorcycle is prematurely returned before the loan is fully settled since the unused portion of the COE can be redeemed.",5,79,014-001-095-090-008-079,1431
