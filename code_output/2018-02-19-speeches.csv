In fact, in the 2016 Committee of Supply debate, as far back as that, MHA had announced that we were reviewing the regulations of fruit machines. In July 2017, we announced the outcome of the review, with new regulations to ensure that the fruit machines remain only an ancillary part of a club's broader suite of recreation and social offerings.",1,8,013-001-094-060-001-008,8

For example, how do they intend to break the news to the affected students, making arrangements to assist students, staff and teachers to attend the wake. Another thing that the teachers will be supported in terms of information, is schools will advise the teachers to direct any queries from the parents or the members of the public to the Principal or designated staff.

ECDA will look at all appeals on a case-by-case basis and we have given exemptions to those who can provide reasons to the childcare centre and with supporting documents, such as retrenchments and through health reasons or their other care-giving obligations.

In fact, ours is similar to that of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA). This EU regulation also requires reporting of any injury that results in more than three days of sick leave. The reporting regimes in other countries also do not require all injuries to be reported. For example in the UK, beyond the prescribed list of reportable injuries, such as fractures, amputations, burns or blindness, all other injuries are only reportable if the sick leave is seven days or more. Hence, our reporting regime of three days or more is actually more robust. The UK also requires the injury to be reportable if it results in hospitalisation for more than 24 hours, which is similar to our reporting regime.",3,4,013-001-094-060-016-004,255

In that respect, we have developed a mobile app called SnapSAFE. Any company can download this app and use it as their internal reporting system, where their workers or any other employees can report near-misses to the management so as to give the management the opportunity to rectify all the potential risks at the workplace to prevent workplace injuries or fatalities from happening.

Businesses that support their staff to volunteer and provide services to IPCs receive a 250% tax deduction on associated costs incurred. An example of an IPC that has benefited is the Shared Services for Charities (SSC). So, through SSC, accounting firms provide pro bono services, such as reviews of internal controls, risk assessment and audits, to charities.

2018-02-19,Annual Budget Statement,013-001-094-060-024,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Indeed, we have been doing so over the last decade. I mentioned earlier that we introduced the NIR framework in 2008. This started out with the reserves managed by GIC and Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). Temasek was then included in the framework in 2015. Through this framework, we now spend on the basis of total returns on our reserves, including both realised and unrealised capital gains.",108,278,013-001-094-060-024-278,617

2018-02-19,Annual Budget Statement,013-001-094-060-024,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"If instead, we used 100% of the returns, the principal sum of the reserves will stagnate over time, and the NIRC as a share of GDP will consequently fall as our economy grows.

2018-02-19,Annual Budget Statement,013-001-094-060-024,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"We must also never forget that as an island nation with no hinterland and no natural resources, our reserves lend long-term stability to our economy and afford us the means to weather crises. During the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, our reserves and strong economic fundamentals kept the Singapore dollar stable even as currency speculators were attacking other regional currencies. During the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, our reserves anchored our economy against the storm by backing a $150 billion guarantee for all bank deposits in Singapore. And during the recession in 2009, our reserves funded a total of $4 billion for the Jobs Credit Scheme and Special Risk-Sharing Initiative to help employers and employees tide over the difficult period.",115,285,013-001-094-060-024-285,624

This is higher than the $1.9 billion or 0.4% of GDP forecasted a year ago. This increase of $7.7 billion is mainly due to exceptional Statutory Board contributions of $4.6 billion, primarily from MAS, and increased stamp duty collections of $2 billion due to the recent property market pick-up.

It will also allow us to remove cash facilities at MRT stations and buses eventually, freeing up space, manpower and other resources that the Government and the Public Transport Operators (PTO) can dedicate towards enhancing our public transport system and commuter experience. For example, any cost savings from the streamlining of ticketing infrastructure can be channelled towards building of new transport infrastructure.
