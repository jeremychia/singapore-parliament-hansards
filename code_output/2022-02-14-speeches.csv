So, whether or not there could be a bit more support in terms of counselling, mentorship, perhaps? I note that the supervisor in this case has been found to have lapsed in his supervision, but could there have been other channels of oversight or avenues for the officer to escalate those stressors and the pressures that he may face?",2,19,014-001-095-047-003-019,57

First, we put the officers at the heart of what we do because there is something even more central and fundamental – which is public interest. The officers are there to serve public interest and if public interest is affected in some way, we have to take action. But the institution can only do well if the officers are treated fairly. The officers have to be treated fairly so that they can do their job and so that public interest – which is the fundamental, primary, central goal – is achieved.",1,20,014-001-095-047-003-020,58

In every context, there are officers' senior officers who are tasked to take feedback, collect, understand and, in fact, part of leadership, that has to be emphasised – not just in SPF, but in other places, too – is to make sure that the morale of your officers remains high. Surveys – both internal as well as independent – show that the morale of Police officers is high. And public confidence in the Police force, despite some scurrilous attempts by some third parties to continuously run down the Police, remains extremely high. Contrary to the way people perceive police forces in many other parts of the world, the Singapore Police officer is held in very high esteem, very high regard.

In the preschool, teachers may also flag up children with suspected developmental delays to early intervention professionals, who will work with paediatricians to determine the children's needs.

Project 3i aims to strengthen community support for caregivers by connecting caregivers with others in the community, providing befriending and peer mentorship by trained caregivers, and providing caregivers and families with complex needs with advisory support from professional volunteers, including doctors, therapists, teachers and psychologists, to help them better navigate and access mainstream health and social services.

The caregiving journey can be a stressful one and caregivers need our strong support.

My question relates to children who need extra support in schools. I have a few questions. First, how does the Ministry track how these children are doing in school? Secondly, how does the Ministry track how successful these measures of support are? And, finally, are there any proactive steps being taken within a framework, some kind of formal screening available, to identify students who might have learning difficulties or special needs and benefit from these forms of support, and also their families, their parents and their caregivers?",1,58,014-001-095-047-004-058,124
2022-02-14,Support for Children with Special Needs and Their Caregivers,014-001-095-047-004,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"  Mr Speaker, Sir, in response to Ms He Ting Ru's questions, I will just make the following points. The tracking is on a continuous basis. Of course, the tracking is not based on the usual academic standards that we use. Very often, for the students with special education needs, if they are following the mainstream curriculum, then we track their progress. But very importantly, in this progress, we are not trying to measure themselves against other people. As I have always said, for us, it is more important to surpass ourselves than to surpass other people. For many of our children with special needs, the goal is really for them to improve over what they have been able to achieve the previous day, the previous year, to give themselves a sense of confidence, a sense of independence. And that is what, if you like, broadly how we measure our success, in a very broad way.",1,59,014-001-095-047-004-059,125
2022-02-14,Support for Children with Special Needs and Their Caregivers,014-001-095-047-004,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The second point I would like to make is that we are always in close contact with the parents and the families, so that we can work hand in hand between the school and the families to help progress our children, each according to their potential. Where necessary, we will bring in the education, the professional psychologist to help equip both our teachers with the necessary skill-sets and also the parents with the necessary skill-sets to cope and to care for the children with special needs. So, it is not the kind of usual tracking that we would use for the usual academic yardsticks or performance yardsticks for typical children, but I think for each of the children with special needs, we have to customise the programme according to their needs.",2,60,014-001-095-047-004-060,126
2022-02-14,Support for Children with Special Needs and Their Caregivers,014-001-095-047-004,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"And I would like to make this point that, while we generally use the word ""special needs"", the special needs community is not homogeneous. Every child with special needs is special in their own ways and they do need different levels of support with different learning needs as well. So, that is why, to add on to what Minister Masagos says, because of the spectrum of needs, we also need a spectrum of solutions in order to best cater to the respective needs.",3,61,014-001-095-047-004-061,127

MSF has, over the years, issued transport concession cards to persons with disabilities; it has the registry and has been helping them.

Many of us want to try to help the caregivers in our respective constituencies, but we also lack resources and the know-how to help them. So, we really hope that the Ministry can come up with programmes and roll them out fast, besides the 3i initiative that we have. We really hope that the Ministry can work with the different segments of society, the population as a whole, so that we can all work together to better prevent this very sad case of a double murder.",2,64,014-001-095-047-004-064,130

The Alliance for Action (AfA) was launched, basically, to get more feedback from caregivers, organisations, parents on what more we need to do. We hope that this will be completed within this year, if not, earlier. And we will take those inputs on board, including the suggestion by the Member, to have a registry. Whether we want to actually do this from the Government, top-down view, my view is that we want to ask the caregivers and see whether this will help them, how it will help them and, at the same time, also have enough protection for their confidentiality, if they want it.",1,65,014-001-095-047-004-065,131

Because we really need a variety of solutions, a variety of know-hows, a variety of resources.

Electricity which is offered through the regulated tariff is purchased by SP through existing long-term vesting contracts with the gencos. SP has contracted a limited quantity of such long-term electricity contracts and we have to reserve them for households, for small business consumers, who, traditionally, do not have the bargaining power to negotiate for better retail prices.",2,49,014-001-095-047-007-049,205

This will then cause the regulated tariffs to rise. So, all households and small consumers, who are, today, on the regulated tariff would then have to bear the costs of price stability for the large consumers.

Sir, I understand that the reason the gencos were able to offer TRECS to the mid-sized consumers, the business consumers, is because they can draw on the standby LNG facilities set up by EMA.

If they were to lock in long-term contracts of a year or two years today, and if the stability comes back to some level of normality, they may find that they are at a disadvantage.

I have a question for the Minister for Transport. Specific to the arrangement of the delegation of the FIR, may I know what are the benefits direct to Singapore?",1,64,014-001-095-047-011-064,363

2022-02-14,The Agreement on the Realignment of the Boundary between the Jakarta and the Singapore Flight Information Regions,014-001-095-047-011,Mr S Iswaran,"  So, as I have said, there is a broader value that this agreement brings for the international civil aviation. Without that assurance, it is really difficult to contemplate how we can move forward for Changi Airport and Singapore, because, ultimately, we are an international aviation hub and, central to that, is our ability to ensure the aircraft landings and take-offs in Changi Airport can be done safely and efficiently. I would say that this is not a unique consideration for Singapore. All airports around the world, especially major aviation hubs, will take this into account, and, in fact, it is central. It would also be the case for Indonesia and its airports. So, whilst we are talking and focusing on Changi Airport, in particular, and our needs, I want to emphasise that this actually brings benefits for all parties, including Indonesian airports.",1,67,014-001-095-047-011-067,366
2022-02-14,The Agreement on the Realignment of the Boundary between the Jakarta and the Singapore Flight Information Regions,014-001-095-047-011,Mr S Iswaran,"So, specifically for us, what it means is, with that assurance, we can now focus on also a range of other initiatives which will help to enhance the services that we can provide in terms of air navigation but also others to support the broader aviation sector in Singapore. It also means that in our discussions with aviation sector stakeholders, including potential investors and companies which want to set up operations here, we are now able to give them greater clarity on the matter and we can move forward on that basis. We are, as the Member by virtue of her background would be aware, looking also at various investments in technology and so on, which will enable us to enhance the quality of services that we can provide from Changi Airport.

It definitely provides a good opportunity for both Singapore and Indonesia to work together better within the 25 years and I think also beyond the 25 years. My clarification is on how we can actually see this as a positive outlook as we look forward in the post-25 year phase as technology changes and, particularly, in the area of air traffic control safety for both countries, Singapore and Indonesia.",3,73,014-001-095-047-011-073,372

That is essential because, as Senior Minister Teo made it very clear, we are neighbours, and we will be neighbours well beyond 25 years. So, it is important that at the foundation of our relationship, we have that confidence and trust. And that is the basis on which we want to go forward. So, we will be working on these various initiatives and, I might add that it is very hard to anticipate the trajectory of civil aviation over two and a half decades.

We have the Singapore Airshow on and I met with some aviation officials this morning and one of the focal points is what in the industry they call ""network operational efficiencies"". This is really about how, between the aircraft avionics and the air navigation service provisions, we can optimise so as to minimise the impediments to smooth flows, because when you have those impediments caused by congestion, weather events and so on, it means aircraft have to circle, burn extra fuel and so on, and it takes on an even more significant hue when we consider these sorts of matters in the context of the broader climate change challenge and the kind of sustainability initiatives that we want to work on. I am just citing that as one example of how we can work together and there are many other areas.

The scheme's validity period has also been extended from 31 March 2021 to 31 December 2026, to support companies adapting and transiting to a low-carbon economy.

How will the Government direct its R&D funding to achieve Singapore Green Plan outcomes? High upfront capital costs, long pay-back periods and the uncertainty of long-term investments are major challenges facing companies, especially SMEs, seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The Workers' Party sees little that is objectionable to providing stronger incentives to businesses for incorporating emissions-reducing projects into their capital expenditure plans. Indeed, in my speech for the Motion on Transition to a Low Carbon Society last month, I had suggested that Government agencies should look for opportunities to weave green elements into their capital expenditure projects. Providing analogous tax breaks for the private sector when they do so is entirely consistent with such a whole-of-society effort to address the climate emergency and I am heartened that such efforts are being weaved into our existing legislation.",2,15,014-001-095-047-016-015,407

The Member for Aljunied, Mr Gerald Giam, spoke about putting in place incentives for households to install solar generation capacity in their private homes by subsidising such installation before recovering the cost of the subsidies from the excess electricity produced by these homes. In a similar spirit, the Member for Hougang, Mr Dennis Tan, reiterated how carbon taxes could be channelled to ensure a just transition, especially among lower-income households and workers who may be displaced by moves toward a more environmentally sustainable economy.",4,17,014-001-095-047-016-017,409

Would these follow the model for existing programmes, such as NEA's Energy Efficiency Fund or BCA's Green Mark Incentive Scheme, via Budget line items, or will there be a more dedicated development fund that is established for this purpose?",5,18,014-001-095-047-016-018,410
2022-02-14,Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief From Income Tax) (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-047-016,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Sir, the second point I wish to touch on is how delegation could give rise to a loss of ownership and responsibility. More specifically, the danger I perceive is that after roles are transferred, the sense of responsibility unforturnately fails to follow. This gives rise to the risk – common even among large private-sector organisations – and what this means for public agencies and functionaries could be a loss of ownership and control.",6,19,014-001-095-047-016-019,411
2022-02-14,Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief From Income Tax) (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-047-016,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Of course, I understand that the Minister retains full and final de jure responsibility over any vested powers. Even so, as humans, it is often easy, too easy perhaps, for this buck to be passed. The last thing we want is a situation where one party appeals to the so-called Richard Nixon defence, where they did not do anything, since it was executed by an underling and they were unaware, while the other claims the Nuremberg defence, famously presented by Adolf Eichmann and his collaborators in justifying their actions during World War II, which is that they were ordered and they did not have any agency in the matter.",7,20,014-001-095-047-016-020,412
2022-02-14,Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief From Income Tax) (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-047-016,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"Moreover, it would not surprise anyone in this House that politicians and bureaucrats are held accountable in a different manner  the former by voters during election time and the latter by their peers and colleagues or the public at large. As a consequence, the two face rather different incentives. Politicians are often motivated by the service to the voters that they represent, which in turn influence their re-election prospects. Bureaucrats, in contrast, are guided more by careerist ambitions; if they excel, they can improve their chances for professional advancement, or prospects in the private sector after they exit the Public Service.",8,21,014-001-095-047-016-021,413
2022-02-14,Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief From Income Tax) (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-047-016,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"This divergence between accountability structures and, in turn, behavioural outcomes, means that policy may actually be more optimally executed by one group or the other, depending on the nature of the task at hand. In particular, research has suggested that complex tasks – premised on ability rather than effort – are better performed when delegated to bureaucrats. Politicians, conversely, are preferable if flexibility over our understanding of society's preferences is important, and this is especially so when there is a need to compensate potential losers arising from any associated policy reform.",9,22,014-001-095-047-016-022,414

2022-02-14,Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief From Income Tax) (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-047-016,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"The first has to do with monetary policy, which is rather topical, in light of our nation's recent challenges with high inflation. The simple framework I have described suggests that the inflation target – say, keeping core inflation just under 2% per annum – should be chosen by politicians, while the more technically challenging task of choosing the appropriate interest rate, size of balance sheet and the specific exchange rate level would fall under the ambit of our central bankers within the Monetary Authority of Singapore.",11,24,014-001-095-047-016-024,416

Here, my argument is that it should fall on elected representatives to determine how much inequality society can tolerate, which redistributive goals would be fair and just, and what types of taxes we should accommodate. The technicalities of getting us there – adjusting specific marginal tax rates, executing efficient expenditures and ensuring a balanced budget – these should then fall back into the laps of professionals in MOF.",12,25,014-001-095-047-016-025,417

In 2016, the US Department of Homeland Security conducted a hacking exercise. They were able to penetrate the system of a passenger plane without insider help or being on board. Today, many aspects of aviation are digitalised, from the sale of air tickets, to inflight systems, to the management of jet fuel and air traffic control. The importance of software in civil aviation is paramount. For example, seemingly minor software issues eventually led to Boeing's 737 Max crisis.

In recent years, drones have become increasingly sophisticated. Its application has become more widespread through Government, commercial and personal use. A quick Internet search reveals that poorly secured drones can be easily hacked by the layman. Drones are already in use by terror outfits for the delivery of arms, explosives and targeted attacks. They do not have to be complex or carry explosives in order to terrorise or kill. The simple act of spraying water over a group of people or nose-diving into a crowd is enough to cause fear and a potentially fatal stampede.

Section 9 of the Act lists the penalties for offences under the Act, namely, life imprisonment or a fine not exceeding $1 million.

More than 3,000 people were killed. It sparked a war on terror, which is still ongoing. Closer to home, as what Member Poh Li San has shared, many would remember the hijacking of SQ Flight 117. The reason why I am speaking on this Bill is because, with COVID-19 turning endemic, our aviation sector will pick up again. Our neighbours in Asia are building and expanding their airports, which could pose as a serious competition to our aviation industry. Aviation is thus important to Singapore. I would further argue that our status as an aviation hub is not only essential, but existential for our survival as a country. We must ensure that our aircraft, airports and airspaces are safe, if we are to continue to be a global aviation hub.",14,72,014-001-095-047-017-072,509

Newer aviation technologies, some which are accessible to the layman, are being deployed. Warfare is moving from the conventional to the unconventional, to non-state adversaries. The lines are being blurred. Today, domestic terrorism is well on the way to become a much bigger threat than before, as widening disparities and misinformation threaten the unity of a nation.

For example, depending on the circumstances, the flying of a drone to intentionally collide with a landing aircraft may potentially fall under the scope of section 5(1)(a) of the Act, which covers acts, regardless of the means used, which damage an aircraft so as to render it incapable of flight or as to be likely to endanger its safety in flight.",6,81,014-001-095-047-017-081,518

The offence creating provisions in the Bill apply to aircraft used in military, customs or Police service in certain circumstances. For example, under the amended section 3, the offence of hijacking can be applied to such aircraft if (a) the person seizing or exercising control of the aircraft is a citizen of Singapore; (b) his act is committed in or over Singapore; or (c) the aircraft is used in Singapore's military, customs or Police service. This approach balances the immunity enjoyed by the state aircraft of other countries under international law, with the need to protect Singapore and Singaporeans in certain situations. Nonetheless, the Government stands ready to detect, handle and neutralise any safety and security threats to our civil aviation system, including in relation to any aircraft used in military, customs or Police services, in accordance with domestic and international law.",8,83,014-001-095-047-017-083,520

Hence, I would like to ask, what is the likely take-up rate of this virtual wedding option?

For example, when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out globally, there were Singaporeans who were stuck overseas and could not return for a certain period of time.

This is especially pertinent when it comes to teenage and youth marriages, which has long been recognised to be a source of various societal issues, such as high divorce rates, dysfunctional families, drug abuse and juvenile delinquency. In the context of civil marriages, it has been suggested that the Registry of Marriages will have the discretion to ask couples to go through the steps in-person where there may be suspicions of a marriage of convenience, for instance.

Despite the numerous obstacles faced by many couples in the last two years, they do acknowledge that these strict controls are necessary and they bravely and patiently overcame these obstacles so that they can proceed to build a home together.

Meeting such targets is, of course, dependent on a range of factors and not only Government policies. This is clear and I do not disagree with this.

We must not over-emphasise effort indicators in our public communications. Doing well on effort indicators can lull us into a false sense of security and self-congratulation. Rather, we should prioritise outputs and outcomes. These determine whether we have won or lost the battle.

2022-02-14,Rethinking Preventive Health to Generate Better Outcomes,014-001-095-047-020,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Firstly, I would speak on rewarding good health choices. It is time to provide serious financial nudges to citizens to encourage healthy behaviours.

We can use various touch-points, like family doctors in whom many trust deeply, to spread the word.",23,26,014-001-095-047-020-026,775

2022-02-14,Rethinking Preventive Health to Generate Better Outcomes,014-001-095-047-020,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),I realise that this is a significant departure from the current approach. Further study should be done before adopting this as a general policy. The approach of testing a major policy through randomised controlled trials was also something I argued for when calling for smaller form class sizes in schools in an Adjournment Motion in 2017 and I have argued for this year as well.,25,28,014-001-095-047-020-028,777

This is something that most governments in the world have done, including Singapore's Government, and rightly so.",26,29,014-001-095-047-020-029,778
2022-02-14,Rethinking Preventive Health to Generate Better Outcomes,014-001-095-047-020,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"But the principle of making vaccines free can be extended.

2022-02-14,Rethinking Preventive Health to Generate Better Outcomes,014-001-095-047-020,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, in the past, I have argued for making HPV free and added to the compulsory immunisation schedule for children. I also called for a bigger role for free vaccines in the public health system, rather than simply allowing MediSave to be used for vaccines. MediSave is, after all, our own money. Many Singaporeans are reluctant to touch it for something less tangible like a vaccine, fearing that they would need all the MediSave that they can get later in life for actual medical treatment. Vaccines have huge public benefits, as we have seen during COVID-19, so the Government should pay for them.",28,31,014-001-095-047-020-031,780

I remember having an exchange in this House with then Senior Parliamentary Secretary Mr Amrin Amin, asking him if the subsidies for vaccines can be pegged to the amount of money the state would save from higher vaccination rates. He replied, saying they were crafting this package and would announce the details in time. I would like to repeat this call.",29,32,014-001-095-047-020-032,781
2022-02-14,Rethinking Preventive Health to Generate Better Outcomes,014-001-095-047-020,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"There is much more that can be done to improve vaccine take-up rates. Our take-up rate for flu vaccines, for example, is much lower than it should be, compared to some other developed countries. In a reply to my earlier Parliamentary Question, the Government acknowledged that our take-up rate for flu vaccinations of 24% among Singaporeans aged 65 and above is significantly lower than the equivalent rate of about 70% in Australia, the UK and the US.",30,33,014-001-095-047-020-033,782

There is a great deal of suffering and costs involved in treating flu patients who become ill. Let us start with making flu vaccines free and thus easy to get for key groups like pregnant women, those with chronic health conditions and older folk over 65. Again, GPs can play a big role in promoting adult vaccination. This reasoning can also be applied to the pneumococcal vaccine.",31,34,014-001-095-047-020-034,783

2022-02-14,Rethinking Preventive Health to Generate Better Outcomes,014-001-095-047-020,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, next, I would like to talk about health screening. Screen for Life (SFL) is a well-intentioned policy, but low take-up rates leave much to improve on. According to MOH's response to a Parliamentary Question I filed, 100,000 out of 1.8 million of eligible Singaporeans, or 5.6%, have benefited from SFL subsidies. By comparison, take-up rates of national health screening programmes are 22% in Japan and 30% in Taiwan, versus our 5.6%. Take-up is notably skewed towards the Chinese community, compared to other ethnic groups. Sir, I do acknowledge the Government's efforts to reach out to community groups to raise health screening take-up, including among minority communities. These are worthy efforts, but, clearly, the results still leave room for improvement.",33,36,014-001-095-047-020-036,785
2022-02-14,Rethinking Preventive Health to Generate Better Outcomes,014-001-095-047-020,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"HPB should conduct studies into the reasons for low take-up rates despite heavy subsidies for health screening under SFL. Anecdotally, lower-income constituents I have met will occasionally share that they do not wish to go for health screening as they are daunted by the high cost of treatment, or what they perceive to be the high cost of treatment, if disease is detected. If those who are most at risk of chronic diseases are not getting screened, this will not only incur greater downstream costs to the individual and the society, but also raise deeper questions about access to basic healthcare for the most vulnerable among us.",34,37,014-001-095-047-020-037,786

2022-02-14,Rethinking Preventive Health to Generate Better Outcomes,014-001-095-047-020,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Firstly, as mentioned earlier, the Government could provide subsidies for MediShield Life premiums for those who regularly undertake health screenings. Some insurers, like NTUC Income, reward policyholders who have good health screening results with shopping vouchers. Sir, many studies prove that it is far cheaper to screen and to catch a disease early and slow down its progression.",36,39,014-001-095-047-020-039,788
2022-02-14,Rethinking Preventive Health to Generate Better Outcomes,014-001-095-047-020,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In Singapore, one in three diabetics, one in four people with hypertension and almost half of those with high cholesterol levels do not know that they have these conditions. Those who do not know that they have these diseases will push up costs for everyone. I have called in a past Parliamentary Question for inclusion of waist circumference measurement in national health screenings. This metric is important in defining obesity risk, rather than over-relying on the Body Mass Index (BMI). I am glad that MOH is moving to implement this and I look forward to seeing more evidence-based inclusions in health screening.",37,40,014-001-095-047-020-040,789

Many lower-income Singaporeans lack the means to purchase and cook healthier foods. When I say this, of course, I do not mean that all healthy foods are costly, but many healthy food decisions are more expensive, complicated or time-consuming.",38,41,014-001-095-047-020-041,790

It could also focus on unprocessed foods like raw meat. A digital currency would be easily programmable and could be updated monthly to reflect inflation.

2022-02-14,Rethinking Preventive Health to Generate Better Outcomes,014-001-095-047-020,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Sir, I also want to make a more philosophical point about helping the poor on health. Our preventive health programmes tend to place personal responsibility on individuals to take charge of their health and lead healthy lifestyles. However, we have a collective responsibility to ensure the less privileged among us also have access to healthy lifestyle habits and are supported in that direction. Health is a critical dimension in improving lives and livelihoods for poorer Singaporeans.",41,44,014-001-095-047-020-044,793

This is a shocking figure. Though it should be said that similar statistics can be found in other developed countries, at the 2021 Committee of Supply, then Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, remarked that MOH paid special attention to lower-income households, including their preventive health needs.

Can we think of alternative models where there is a degree of incentivisation based on the success of the healthcare provider in nudging patients towards better health outcomes? In other words, instead of paying providers just for treating the sick, can we pay them in part, at least, for encouraging their patients not to get sick in the first place?",44,47,014-001-095-047-020-047,796

In comments made during the Ministerial panel on Primary Care at the session of the WHO Regional Committee for the Western Pacific held in October 2021, Minister Ong also shared that MOH was looking to change the system focus from acute hospital care back to preventive care provided in the community and primary care settings, which would result in a very good quality system that is also sustainable.",4,65,014-001-095-047-020-065,814

One of the things we discussed is on the possibility of a capitation model, to transform our primary care providers' way of engaging with our patients.

His underlying assumption is that if we make things cheaper, in fact, make it free, the take-up rate will improve. But actually, having sat across the table with many patients, advising them on health screening, in preventive health, the hardest hurdle to overcome is the mindset and health beliefs of the individual. We all know what is good for us, health-wise. Every doctor counsels and wants his patients to go and do the right things for his own health. But, alas, in real life, changing mindset and health-seeking beliefs is not something that policy or clinical protocols alone can change.",7,68,014-001-095-047-020-068,817

This illustrates the point that despite efforts to reduce the cost barrier to screening, more still needs to be done to address the individual’s perceptions, their barriers, their fears, to undergo screening.

2022-02-14,Estimated Maintenance Costs of Features and Landscaping During Design of Common Property in BTO Estates,014-001-095-047-034,Mr Desmond Lee,"  The designs and specifications for HDB Build-To-Order (BTO) projects, including the features and landscaping in common areas, do factor in considerations on sustainability and maintainability. For instance, for features in common areas, such as furniture and murals in community living rooms, HDB assesses the durability, ease of maintenance and cost of replacement when developing designs. As for landscaping, HDB considers the ease and frequency of maintenance and replacement when determining the planting design and choice of plant species. Irrigation systems are also provided for skyrise greenery to minimise downstream manpower costs and planting replacement costs.",1,2,014-001-095-047-034-002,909
2022-02-14,Estimated Maintenance Costs of Features and Landscaping During Design of Common Property in BTO Estates,014-001-095-047-034,Mr Desmond Lee,"Besides maintenance and cost considerations, HDB also takes into account the environmental and social benefits of the features and landscaping provided, to enhance the quality of living environment for residents. For example, in designing the landscaping in new HDB estates, HDB adopts biophilic design principles through incorporating natural elements, such as flora and fauna, as well as human interaction patterns, in its design to promote a greater sense of place and enhanced quality of life for residents. Similarly, roof gardens above Multi-Storey Car Parks (MSCPs) are designed not just for aesthetic purposes, but as community spaces for residents to enjoy and to serve important environmental functions, such as reducing stormwater runoff from concrete roofs and reducing the urban heat island effort for a more comfortable living environment.",2,3,014-001-095-047-034-003,910
2022-02-14,Estimated Maintenance Costs of Features and Landscaping During Design of Common Property in BTO Estates,014-001-095-047-034,Mr Desmond Lee,"HDB consults Town Councils (TCs) on the choice of plant species, irrigation systems and any special features in new developments at multiple junctures, for instance, before calling for tender, commencing construction and/or after project launch. Hence, there are opportunities for TCs to surface potential maintenance issues upstream, so that they can be addressed at the design or construction stage. If TCs have further comments, HDB will review the design and make reasonable adjustments before handing over completed projects to the TCs. Upon project completion, HDB will also conduct site walks with TCs and, for developments with special features, brief TCs on how to maintain such features.",3,4,014-001-095-047-034-004,911
2022-02-14,Estimated Maintenance Costs of Features and Landscaping During Design of Common Property in BTO Estates,014-001-095-047-034,Mr Desmond Lee,"As TCs manage and maintain the common property in HDB estates, they would have their own estimates for the maintenance cost for typical common property items. HDB's estimates may not be reflective of the eventual costs borne by TCs as TCs might enjoy economies of scale as their maintenance contracts are typically grouped together in larger zones. To ensure that maintenance costs remain reasonable, HDB regularly reviews the design and provision of features and landscaping when new technology to aid maintenance becomes available and in response to Town Councils' feedback.",4,5,014-001-095-047-034-005,912

For example, public officers who work from home are only able to access central financial systems subject to their compliance with Government data protection and cyber-hygiene requirements. In addition, payment processes in the Public Service have been progressively automated with system controls. This means that invoices are received electronically from suppliers via the electronic invoicing network and this reduces manual handling of paper invoices and the risk of data-entry error by officers. To strengthen governance and oversight, agencies have also adopted network analytics to identify potential conflicts of interest in procurement. Post-disbursement, independent audits and data analytics are also performed to detect any anomalies and verify that funds were channelled appropriately to the intended beneficiaries.",2,3,014-001-095-047-038-003,927

For example, all public officers are required to go through an annual cybersecurity awareness training. GovTech has published a set of best practices on measures that public officers should take to secure their home network and the secure use of video-conferencing tools when working from home. All agencies also have an Agency Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Data Officer who oversee and take charge of cyber and data security matters in agencies.

In the past two weeks, despite cases being three times more than during the Delta wave, we saw on average two to three deaths a day. But there had been days where deaths were also more than five. We have to watch the trend very closely, but, for now, the case mortality due to the Omicron variant is not very different from the number of deaths related to various viral infections pre-COVID.

Now, despite three times the daily caseloads, we have about 30 patients in the ICU across our hospitals. Of these, about 60% are intubated.

There are about 1,200 COVID-19 cases who are currently hospitalised. Of these about 30% are ""incidental cases"". This means they are admitted for non-COVID-19 conditions and subsequently found to have COVID-19 during their stay because we test every patient. This group, typically, has no or very mild symptoms. In other words, they do not take up extra beds due to their infection. So, the extra workload on our hospitals is two-thirds of the 1,200 hospitalised cases. Further, most Omicron patients also have a short hospital stay of about three to four days, compared to five to eight days for patients infected with the Delta variant. It means beds are freed up faster.",12,13,014-001-095-047-041-013,952

Some countries have reported that their healthcare workers are resigning in droves. Here, the attrition rates of doctors from our public acute hospitals have remained comparable to 2019, before COVID-19 hit, about 3% to 5%. For nurses, the average attrition during the two COVID-19 years of 2020 and 2021 is about 8%, comparable to 2019. Absenteeism rate due to COVID-19 has been manageable and is about 2% now. We do not take this for granted, and will continue to support our healthcare professionals.

They cannot mingle with other worshippers who are taking part in activities subjected to VDS, such as congregational worship services. Allowing unvaccinated individuals to gather only in very small groups reduces the risk of widespread transmission of the virus and severe health outcomes for the unvaccinated.",2,3,014-001-095-047-042-003,959

2022-02-14,Number of Infant Care Applications and Successful Placement Rates in 2021,014-001-095-047-043,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"  As preschools manage their own processes for child and infant care enrolment into their centres, ECDA does not track their application and placement rates. Instead, ECDA tracks preschool interest registered by parents via the Preschool Search Portal (PSP) launched in 2019. Parents may register interest in as many as 10 preschools at the same time on the PSP. While we strongly encourage all parents to use the PSP, this is voluntary, and some parents may also directly contact their chosen preschools. In 2021, 830 parents of unenrolled infants registered interest for an infant care place via the PSP. This constituted 1% of all families with infants in Singapore.",1,2,014-001-095-047-043-002,962

While the overall situation shows sufficient supply, there remain localised areas with waitlists. This could be due to several factors, such as parents preferring specific preschools or wanting preschool places close to their homes, and time needed for preschools to ramp up their infant care operations. While we are building new preschools closer to families, it is not always possible for families to have a preschool at the same block or within a few blocks of their homes.",2,3,014-001-095-047-043-003,963

We will continue to increase capacity where needed to meet demand for early childhood services. By the end of 2022, ECDA will develop an additional 1,000 infant care places – offered largely by anchor operators and mainly in Planning Areas with upcoming HDB developments for new families.

2022-02-14,Business Costs for Point-to-point Sector for Passenger Transport in Past Two Years,014-001-095-047-044,Mr S Iswaran,"  The business costs of driving a taxi or private hire car typically include vehicle rental, commissions paid to platform operators as well as fuel cost, which are subject to global fuel price fluctuations. Compared to January 2020, overall costs of business for point-to-point (P2P) drivers have increased by about 6%. This is mainly due to a rise in fuel expenditure, as fuel prices have increased over the past six months. With the gradual recovery of P2P ridership, drivers have also made more trips and seen increased operating costs in recent months.",1,2,014-001-095-047-044-002,966

Currently, P2P ridership has recovered to nearly 80% of pre-COVID levels, bolstering drivers' incomes.

This is a punitive measure that is not undertaken lightly. HDB exercises the right of compulsory acquisition sparingly and as a last resort. Moreover, should a flat be compulsorily acquired, the flat owners and occupants of the flat, such as their family members, will need to relocate and find a home elsewhere.

For example, since the mid-1980s, the walls between two flats are made with 100-millimetre reinforced concrete, instead of the hollow blocks used in older flats. In addition, for flats built since 1995, the floor slabs are made of at least 150-millimetre thick bare concrete, which provide better impact noise insulation, compared to the 125-millimetre bare concrete used in older flats. More recently, since February 2017, buyers of Build-to-Order (BTO) flats can also choose to have vinyl strip flooring in their bedrooms, which further reduces sounds from impact.

2022-02-14,Update on Lamppost-as-a-Platform Project,014-001-095-047-060,Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister),"With the near completion of the first trial, GovTech has assessed that the mounting of sensors on lampposts is technically feasible and has also established the various cost components and drivers. GovTech has developed a lamppost infrastructure design that converts a normal lamppost into a shareable LaaP that can accommodate multiple sensors. This is important as agencies deploying sensors in the same locations can share the same LaaP infrastructure and avoid duplicating the resources and time to set up their own infrastructure. However, we will start to retrofit all lampposts only when suitable large-scale use cases with cost-effective benefits can be identified. These use cases can then form the anchor demand to roll out LaaP more widely.",3,4,014-001-095-047-060-004,1047

Greenfield sites without any pre-existing lampposts, present the opportunity to design and build a new integrated LaaP that is more compact and durable by having the cables and equipment housed inside the lamppost casing, as opposed to being on the exterior under the retrofitted design. We are also testing other use cases in residential areas, such as monitoring playground activities within housing estates, so that residents may feel more assured of playground safety.",4,5,014-001-095-047-060-005,1048

Agencies also step up enforcement checks around specific hotspots. While agencies proactively work with stakeholders to plan the necessary safe management arrangements, it is not possible to prevent crowds from forming spontaneously. When unforeseen crowding takes place and agencies are alerted, SDAs and EOs will respond to the site and act to disperse the crowds.

However, even when caseloads were reduced (for example, where a programme could serve fewer clients due to safe management measures), MSF maintained funding at pre-COVID-19 levels. Beyond this, MSF provided additional funding to all programmes during FY2020 and FY2021 in the form of support for ancillary costs during COVID-19. For example, overall MSF funding to the Family Service Centres (FSCs) increased from $85.2 million to $90 million, or 5.6%, from FY2019 to FY2020, although actual changes in funding for each FSC would have varied, depending on their caseload and client profile.",2,3,014-001-095-047-089-003,1174

Besides food charities providing food support, there are also numerous ground-up initiatives by volunteer groups, grassroots organisations and corporates. Many initiatives, while well-intended, are uncoordinated and some are ad hoc rather than regular activities. Food wastage on the ground can occur when households receive duplicative food support, or food support that is unsuitable for their needs.

MSF is coordinating the development of a food directory and database. This will further support our LFCs and food support organisations, as they will be able to check on duplications and coordinate with other food support organisations to best support the households in need. The food directory will enable members of the public or social service agencies to search for food support based on location or dietary requirements.

2022-02-14,Forecast of Onset of Negative Local Workforce Growth and Likelihood of It Stagnating,014-001-095-047-110,Dr Tan See Leng,"  Resident workforce growth has been slowing due to lower birth rates and an ageing population. From 2011 to 2015, the resident workforce grew by 55,200 per annum on average. From 2016 to 2020, resident workforce growth averaged 20,600 per annum. In the March 2017 Parliamentary Sitting, we said that we expect resident workforce growth to head for stagnation over the subsequent 10 years. However, we now expect our resident workforce to continue growing beyond 2027. This is, in part, due to rising resident employment rates in the 65 and over age group as well as for women, reflecting our efforts to raise the employability of senior workers and women. The point at which our resident workforce will stagnate will depend on a host of factors, including our continued efforts mentioned above.",1,2,014-001-095-047-110-002,1252
