2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"  Mdm Speaker, the eligibility criteria for the anchor operator scheme were set to ensure that the operators' programmes are accessible to children of all backgrounds, and that the Government's funding goes towards serving the public good rather than private profit. Anchor operators are required to demonstrate financial stability and commit to meeting the quality and affordability targets set by the Ministry. The scheme is currently being reviewed and the Implementation Committee for Enhancing Pre-School Education co-chaired by MOE and MSF will announce more details by the second quarter of this year.",1,6,012-001-090-004-001-006,6
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Mr Yee asked how we ensure that child care centres do not raise fees excessively in response to the recent enhancements to subsidies. First, we have designed the enhancements to give more assistance to families who require more help. Lower income families will receive more subsidy, as well as larger families with a lower per capita income. As the enhancements are not universal, it is less likely that operators can raise fees across the board. Second, we will continue to facilitate the development of more centres in areas where there is demand, and grow the number of good quality, affordable places through the anchor operator scheme to help keep overall fees in check.",2,7,012-001-090-004-001-007,7
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the number and distribution of new centres by anchor operators, it would be premature for us to update on this as the new operators have yet to be chosen and made their submissions for the new sites. We are committed to building as many centres as necessary to meet demand for good quality, affordable child care services.",3,8,012-001-090-004-001-008,8
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"  I thank the Acting Minister for the answers. I have three supplementary questions. One for each of the Parliamentary Question I filed. The first is I want to understand the policy ideas versus other Government policies. For example, MOE is quite generous in supporting schools that have religious affiliations. They are the Government-aided schools and they get very generous support. Also, in the transport industry, public transport is run by private companies with very generous Government support. There appears to be some inconsistency with the Government policies here, and I would like a clarification from the Acting Minister.",1,9,012-001-090-004-001-009,9
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"The second clarification is whether centres do need to get MSF permission if they wish to raise fees. And if they still raise fees after all the monitoring by MSF and after all these generous grants have been given out, what is MSF's position on this? Does MSF impose certain curbs on excessive fee increase?",2,10,012-001-090-004-001-010,10
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"The third clarification if that I am rather concern, looking at past data, because of the very few numbers of void deck centres that are available for private operators to bid for. It has resulted in centres being bidded up to $45,000 per month rental. Anybody who operates in the industry knows that this is definitely not a viable model. But if going forward, there are too few centres allocated for the other operators and all centres have gone to the Anchor Operators, then we will have another bidding war and we will see the rents of centres going up.",3,11,012-001-090-004-001-011,11
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"  Mdm Speaker, I thank Mr Yee for his three supplementary questions. On the first, different sectors have different characteristics. It is different for the transport sector and different for the pre-school sector. What we are most concerned with in the pre-school sector is to ensure that we have adequate and affordable services for the mass market. There will always be parents who will require niche services, and I think they are at liberty to pursue those services. But when it comes to Government funding, we would like to use Government funding, where we can, to support the mass market options so that most of our parents would have the quality and affordable options available to them. For all the Anchor Operators that take on Government subsidies, it is incumbent upon us to ensure that they make access available to children from all backgrounds, independent of religious affiliations.",1,12,012-001-090-004-001-012,12
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The other thinking is this. When we spend what is public money, then we should ensure that the public money goes on to benefit the two groups of people. One, the families and children involved. The other is the teachers providing the services that are so important in this sector. We would be very careful to design a scheme such that the public money does not go into private profit. That has been our abiding principle.",2,13,012-001-090-004-001-013,13
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the second question about how and when the childcare operators can raise fees, we have guidelines in place to ensure that if the childcare operators raise fees, they are to give adequate notice to the parents such that the parents can make the necessary adjustments if need be.",3,14,012-001-090-004-001-014,14
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"For the Anchor Operators, we are more stringent. We ensure that they do not raise fees beyond the industry median. So if we compared the fees of the Anchor Operators with the rest of the industry, generally, they would be below the industry median. For childcare, it would be $750 a month for the industry median; about $615 for the Anchor Operators in the HDB estates.",4,15,012-001-090-004-001-015,15
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the last point about the availability of spaces for various operators – be they Anchor Operators or non-Anchor Operators – my Ministry is working closely with MND and other agencies to ensure that we have as many available and suitable sites as possible for the operators. We know that -- whether Anchor Operators or non-Anchor Operators, rental cost is an issue. To the extent that we can, we will want to provide affordable options to the operators of such childcare facilities. And hopefully, the operators – whether Anchor Operators or non-Anchor Operators – will not raise fees unnecessarily and use the rental as an excuse to do so.",5,16,012-001-090-004-001-016,16
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Moulmein-Kallang),"  Mdm Speaker, I would like to seek Acting Minister's views on whether he would agree that there is a risk for childcare or pre-school education to go the for-profit route, mainly because we know that for-profit organisations are primarily driven by the bottom line. The public has voiced their preference for state-run or hybrid models childcare centres, so that this sector is not purely for-profit.",1,17,012-001-090-004-001-017,17
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Moulmein-Kallang),"My second clarification is to ask if Acting Minister has heard that there are private operators – some from overseas – who are buying up smaller players here in the pre-school and childcare sector, possibly to monopolise the market to have a bigger footprint, and even to bring the merged organisations to IPO (Initial Public Offering). I am still very concerned that Acting Minister has decided to take the for-profit route for this particular sector.",2,18,012-001-090-004-001-018,18
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"  Mdm Speaker, let me thank Ms Denise Phua for her two supplementary questions. Indeed, we share her concerns that people involved in the pre-school or the early childhood development sector should not try to do it primarily for profit and definitely not for the mass market sector. There are a few unique characteristics of this sector. One being that at such an early age, parents are justifiably concerned about their children's development. When you do not have a standardised test to check how much value-add a particular centre provides for the child, there is a danger that people might take price as a proxy for quality. There might also be a danger where people start to chase what they perceive to be quality programmes, which may or may not value add to a child's development.",1,19,012-001-090-004-001-019,19
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In the entire sector, we would not be able to rule out that there will be some people who might be in this work because of profit. What we have to ensure is that where public money is concerned, that if we do give any subsidies, they go towards helping those families that require help most, and not to go into the pockets of people who are pursuing this for private profit.",2,20,012-001-090-004-001-020,20
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We are also equally concerned about this potential of small players being bought up by a conglomerate that is essentially for-profit. This is a problem because it reduces the diversity of the players in the market. The greater concern is that if there is such a situation, then it might actually narrow the mass market options that we want to make available to the public. We are watching this very closely and we will certainly take this into account in the review of our Anchor Operator scheme. Part of the reason for us to have sufficient Anchor Operators is to provide the mass market options for the general public. There might be some for-profit operators that will provide niche solutions at one end of the market for those parents who desire such services. But indeed, we are most concerned if this is to happen. When we announce the results of the review, we will be taking into account this particular aspect.",3,21,012-001-090-004-001-021,21
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"  Thank you, Mdm Speaker, I have a couple of supplementary questions for the Acting Minister. I know it is still early days, but I would just like to check if the Ministry has received any feedback on fee increases at childcare and infant care centres operated by the Anchor Operators, as well as the commercial operators, following the announcement of the Marriage and Parenthood Package.",1,22,012-001-090-004-001-022,22
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr David Ong (Jurong),"The second question is given the high demand for such centres, the worsening crunch in manpower in this sector, rising rentals and the quest for us to get better teachers, what can the Ministry do to mitigate the probable fee hikes, which may negate the effects of higher subsidies.",2,23,012-001-090-004-001-023,23
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"  Mdm Speaker, let me thank Mr David Ong for the two supplementary questions. On the first issue, it is still early days, because we have just announced the enhancement to the childcare subsidies, but we will certainly be watching closely to see if there are any operators who might be opportunistic in this and hope to raise fees. What we have done is this  we have a tiered the level of subsidies to different income groups. There will be a smaller likelihood -- not zero, but smaller likelihood – that they can increase fees across the board. That is one.",1,24,012-001-090-004-001-024,24
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the second issue, indeed the longer term solution to mitigate some of these cost pressures is for us to expand the number of options available in the number of sites, but more importantly, in the number of teachers. The other cost driver for the childcare and early childhood development industry is the quality of the teachers. We are going to spend more money and more effort to develop the teachers, to groom them, to train them, so that the pool of available resources in the entire sector will be bigger than what it is now. That will be an important way for us to mitigate the cost pressures in terms of salaries for this sector. On the other hand, we would also like to gradually upgrade the qualifications of our teachers and with that, the kind of salary remuneration that they can command.",2,25,012-001-090-004-001-025,25
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,There is a multi-pronged approach for us to gradually expand this sector for the early childhood development. We do have a bit of an opportunity at this point in time because the kindergarten cohort sizes are shrinking. There is potential for us to encourage some of the current kindergartens operators to expand their services to the childcare sector.,3,26,012-001-090-004-001-026,26
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"  Mdm Speaker, I have two follow-up questions. The first is regarding the use of the subsidies to benefit the mass market. I definitely agree with the Acting Minister that the subsidies should benefit the mass market, but I have difficulty reconciling this to why religious and race-based groups cannot be supported because many of them have operated for a very long time. They have benefited the people with their programmes and usually at very low fees as well. MOE has been very comfortable dealing with them as long as they do not overly promote religious views. And even for private operators, if he can set certain criteria such that they be monitored to see how much they are charging, to compete with what the Anchor Operators are charging, then I do not see the fear of them over-profiting because they will profit as much as what the Anchors are profiting.",1,27,012-001-090-004-001-027,27
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"The second supplementary question is the Minister said that for the Anchor Operators, the Ministry monitors their fees so that they cannot go above the industry median. We know that the industry median comprises of the private operators and the non-profit operators and the private operators get very little support. They pay very high rents, so, obviously their fees will be very high. Would the Minister agree that it is better to compare their fees against the median of the non-profit operators rather than across the industry?",2,28,012-001-090-004-001-028,28
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"  Mdm Speaker, let me clarify Mr Yee Jenn Jong's first question. Firstly, for public funds that are used to support any programmes in general, we ask that they be made accessible to people from all religious backgrounds. So, we have programmes run by various VWOs -- they are religion-based organisations -- but the programmes must be made accessible to people from different religious backgrounds. And we also ask that they do not proselytise or do not use that to promote any religious belief in any particular sector. I think that is just to be fair to everybody, because these are indeed public funds that we are talking about.",1,29,012-001-090-004-001-029,29
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the second issue about the private sector operators, our philosophy is that as much as we can, we would like to use the public funds for public goods and to minimise the potential possibility of profits going into private pockets. I think that people can generally agree with us.",2,30,012-001-090-004-001-030,30
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the third issue about benchmarking, it is not only just the industry benchmark that we have. Before they do any price increase, for the Anchor Operators, we have stringent criteria to ask them to justify the necessity to increase and what are the cost drivers. We actually drill down to the details. And indeed, for other comparable non-profit operators, we also take them into account in our benchmarking. So, it is not just the industry median. But of course, the industry median is one of the criteria that we take into account.",3,31,012-001-090-004-001-031,31
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Dr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West), ,1,32,012-001-090-004-001-032,32
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"  Mdm Speaker, I thank Dr Lam for the questions. Indeed we are aware of the situation in some of the newer estates like Sengkang. We are open to exploring new ideas and we are also aware that because of the way the new HDB flats are constructed, they do have limited void deck space available for some of these social facilities. We are working with the grassroots advisors in the respective areas to see where we can find new sites. This may include incorporating some of these features into newly developed structures, like for example, multi-storey car parks and other open spaces. We are open to the idea of having modular structures if it is acceptable to the operators and also the parents who are sending their children there. We know that there are some open fields and open areas in Sengkang that can be studied. We are open to such areas and will be happy to work with the Member and the operators to bring those about.",1,33,012-001-090-004-001-033,33
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The other thing that we can do and we are doing is to make sure that there is a better matching of the demand and the supply. Sometimes, the centres are there but they do not provide the classes at the appropriate level for the students of that particular area. We have to encourage the operators to open up classes that accommodate those students.",2,34,012-001-090-004-001-034,34
2013-02-06,New Childcare Centres and Childcare Fees,012-001-090-004-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The last thing that we are doing is to also provide better matching because people generally send their children to three localities; near their homes, near their workplace or near their grandparents' places. So, there is quite a bit of flux in the demand but we are trying to do a better matching of the peoples' demand with where they want to site their children. We are encouraging various employers to try and take up the scheme to set up childcare centres within their workplace. This will provide more options to the parents who need such services.",3,35,012-001-090-004-001-035,35

If it has been successful, we would expect pay TV content to be less fragmented. This is exactly what has been observed.",2,3,012-001-090-004-002-003,38

There were only seven channels, mainly foreign public service channels, available on both StarHub Cable Vision (SCV) and SingNet mio TV (mio TV) prior to the introduction of the Measure. Today, there are over 50 common channels which include general entertainment channels such as ONE, Celestial Movies and FOX International Channels; as well as sports channels such as ESPN and STAR Sports. As pre-existing content deals expire and are renegotiated, we expect that the number of common channels will further increase. MDA, Madam, will continue to monitor the number of common channels over time, as it serves as a good indication of the success of the Measure.",3,4,012-001-090-004-002-004,39

Last year, all consumers, including non pay TV consumers, were able to purchase from SCV, the Euro 2012 tournament on an a la carte basis for the first time without the need for a basic subscription. Mio TV subscribers were able to subscribe to the tournament and watch it via their Mio TV set-top box even though SCV was the exclusive rights holder.",4,5,012-001-090-004-002-005,40

For example, besides the option of viewing subscribed content on TV, both SingNet and SCV are now offering their customers value-added services such as viewing the content over mobile networks and the Internet. This has contributed to a growing and more vibrant pay TV market, as evidenced by the increase in the total number of pay TV subscribers from about 694,000 in 2009 to more than 900,000 last year.",5,6,012-001-090-004-002-006,41

Madam, I would like to emphasise once again that it is not the intent of the Measure to lower the cost of pay TV subscriptions. These costs are driven by multiple factors that the Measure will not be able to address. One key factor is the cost of acquiring premium content, sports or otherwise, which has been rising across the world, in particular for the highly popular sports franchises. Members may be aware that in June 2012, the British rights to broadcast the 2013 to 2016 editions of the Barclays Premier League (BPL 2013/16) were acquired exclusively at slightly over £3 billion or $$6 billion, a 71% increase in price. This inevitably will translate into costs increases. In our region, the prices of the Barclays Premier League 2013/16 season and rights were sold to various ASEAN countries have indeed reportedly seen significant increases.",6,7,012-001-090-004-002-007,42

We encourage consumers to signal their displeasure to the pay TV operators, so that over time, the operators will be more responsive to consumer demand. In this way, we make market forces work in the interest of the consumer.",7,8,012-001-090-004-002-008,43

Today, pay TV operators including nationwide TV providers, SCV and SingNet, and a number of niche pay TV retailers offer more than 400 channels. This is a significant increase from the 236 channels that were available in 2010. Channels are also offering content that is premiering at the same time, or very soon after premiering in their home market.

The objective of the cross-carriage policy, I suppose, was also to bring more players on board. And I hope that we will see a more competitive market. But I also would like to know from the Minister whether other broadcasters, apart from the two that he has mentioned, have expressed interest. What has been prohibiting other such operators from coming in? What measures does MDA had in place for operators who signed non-exclusive content to declare some of these principles of the contract agreement? I understand that MDA requires other operators to provide evidence before they take action and, of course, this kind of commercial arrangement such as discount structures, length of delays before the next person comes in, are barriers for others to come in. My intent is to ensure that the cross-carriage policy has bite and that the regulatory framework also works.",1,12,012-001-090-004-002-012,47

I know many Singaporeans are soccer fans. Given the cross-carriage policy, why has no other players come in? I know SingTel has signed on exclusively last October. We have not heard updates since then. Are there other loopholes – there is market talk – but are there loopholes that have gone into this non-exclusive arrangement that the current framework perhaps could not detect?",2,13,012-001-090-004-002-013,48

Let me begin with the one that all of us have common interest in, which is BPL. All I can say is that negotiations are on-going. MDA is monitoring this very, very closely because you are right and this relates to your third question -- whatever it is, we have to look at every contract that is agreed upon between the provider and the content owners, and ensure it does not, in any way, violate our cross-carriage measure. I want to ensure the Member and the House that the MDA is on top of the situation. We are looking in this very, very closely to see whether there are any built-in barriers which will bypass the regulator. We are on the side of the consumer. We want to provide as many offerings as possible.

In fact, there are a lot of other niche players that have come into the market. We are an open economy and we offer many factors which are positive to international providers. We have a very conducive business environment; we are English-speaking. And so, apart from the two providers, we have other providers like BBC and Discovery, who have anchored their operations here in Singapore.

Clearly, Akamai's results are dependent on its methodology, its content delivery network, the location of its servers relative to the countries it measures, and how it streams its data. But the results point in the same direction, namely, that Singapore is amongst the leading group of countries in broadband access speed. This is a positive sign, considering that a significant amount of traffic is from overseas hosted sites. IDA also regularly measures broadband speeds in Singapore. To get a better sense of the connection speeds experienced by users in Singapore, may I ask Members to refer to Exhibit 2. For example, in November 2012, the local average peak download speed ranged from 93 megabits per second (""Mbps"") to 98.3 Mbps for a 100 Mbps plan. This is at the last bar [referring to the handout]. As expected, while international download speeds are expected to be lower, even in the case of US sites, average peak download speed is still around 41.2 Mbps.",2,5,012-001-090-004-003-005,60

There are ongoing efforts to encourage the hosting or mirroring of more of such content in Singapore. This reduces the geographical distance that Internet traffic has to traverse, thereby speeding up access to desired content. Long-term regulatory measures have also been taken to facilitate the landing of submarine cable systems in Singapore and the cross-connections amongst these cable systems, making Singapore one of the most connected countries with high bandwidth capability today.

IDA does not rule out the option of imposing further regulatory requirements on the ISPs if that is necessary to improve broadband experience of users. However, we need to be mindful that the Internet market is dynamic and complex, and that any regulatory interventions should be justified, effective and sustainable, rather than create uncertainties for the market or inadvertently dull market incentives to invest, innovate, and compete.

On his first question on how the measurement was done, IDA commissioned a local company to perform the measurement of our fixed broadband network performance of the local ISPs. In fact, the results of the performance that we gather are all reported on the IDA's website and it is a consolidated total of 563 test probes installed in the homes of volunteers from both the public and IDA. These test probes cover a selected range of plans from the major residential broadband service providers in Singapore. And at regular intervals, the test probes conduct the series of tests against IDA's test servers housed in the local Internet Data Centres and the US East Coast and West Coast. So it is quite comprehensive, but I will be happy to ask IDA to look into the Member's concern in his own area and see whether we can find out what is the cause of the problem.",1,10,012-001-090-004-003-010,65

The last thing that we want is to introduce new measures that basically dull the market rather than make the market more competitive. I would like to assure the Member and the House that this is a very important concern for us, and so we have now imposed a quality of service (QoS) standard for the fixed broadband that has been set out with specific indicators so that the Internet providers know what is expected of them. We are also reviewing the quality of service standard for fixed time broadband to ensure that it is continually relevant to the end users. We are also considering the feasibility of establishing a broadband quality of service framework for mobile broadband services. So, we will move and ensure that the standards that we want for both fixed and mobile broadband services will meet the expectations of our consumers. But we will not rest there. As I mentioned earlier, for the fixed broadband services, we will monitor the standards that we have already imposed and see whether they continue to be relevant, and we are now considering new standards for the mobile broadband services.",3,12,012-001-090-004-003-012,67

This is an important move as we begin to realise that broadband services are becoming really an essential part of the life in Singapore. By working with the developers to make sure that spaces are provided to allow providers to put up the stations earlier, I think it will help consumers to get their service as soon as possible.",1,14,012-001-090-004-003-014,69

This was in relation to a recent complaint against two clinics who were conducting these medical screenings and there were some questions raised about the adequacy of the screenings. As I understand from the answer, it is still under investigation. But my first question relates to a concern that has been raised previously, which is that there have been some concerns about how robust the manner in which these medical examinations are being carried out. My first question to the Senior Parliamentary Secretary is  what is the procedure by which the criteria are formulated and reviewed?

Because the definition for passing a particular medical examination is perhaps not entirely definite, that is to say that when the worker sees one medical practitioner, and he sees another one, there may be a difference in the opinion about his fitness to work. This is not due to any wrongdoing but, certainly, depending on the criteria and the way it is set out, there could be some difference in opinions.

Third, will we be prepared to make use of alumni or to collaborate and partner with alumni from these youth programmes? The answer is, ""Certainly, we will be happy to collaborate with not just youth sector organisations but individuals who have been alumni from these programmes because they certainly have valuable experience to contribute.",2,9,012-001-090-004-006-009,100

2013-02-06,Policy on Naming Rights for Sports Hub Facilities,012-001-090-004-007,Mr Lawrence Wong,"  Mdm Speaker, the Sports Hub is being developed under a 25-year public-private-partnership (PPP) agreement, where a commercial operator undertakes to finance, build and operate the entire project in return for a pre-agreed payment and a share of the overall revenue. Part of the revenue from the operation of the Sports Hub would include revenue from the sale of naming rights, which then may be used to finance future enhancements to the facilities to have better events and shows as well as to fund community events and support the development of our athletes.",1,2,012-001-090-004-007-002,105

However, any sale of naming rights within the Sports Hub is still subject to SSC's consent.

But as I mentioned earlier, this is already provided for in the agreement where the operator is allowed to sell naming rights for individual facilities within the Sports Hub. It can for the aquatic centre; it can be for the indoor stadium. These are individual facilities within the Sports Hub, but not for the National Stadium which we have preserved. Whichever the company that is prepared to come forward, as I mentioned earlier, would still require the SSC consent and whether or not the SSC agrees to it, they have to do so within reasonable grounds.",1,6,012-001-090-004-007-006,109

I would imagine quite a number of them would be looking at long-term sponsorship arrangements. But, again, that is something that the operator would have to do, talk to the potential sponsors, put up an application and then SSC would look at the application on the merits of each individual case.",3,8,012-001-090-004-007-008,111

We would certainly be considering the naming of facilities that could take the name of some of our public figures or sports personalities. We are prepared to consider the suggestion and that is still provided for within the context of the Sports Hub because, as I said, not all of the naming rights have been sold or are part of the agreement with the operator. There are still entities where the naming rights have not been provided for in the commercial agreement. So there are still entities within the Sports Hub which we can name and the Government can decide to so name in a different manner or after a sports personality or after a public figure, as he has suggested. We have not decided; we have not made that decision. But the option is there. So we would be prepared to study that.",1,10,012-001-090-004-007-010,113

Whatever the media speculation, any interested party can approach the Sports Hub company and let them know that they are interested in a sponsorship deal with naming rights for a particular facility. It is open to any company. I know that the Sports Hub operator has been talking to many parties. There has been a media report speculating about a potential deal with one local bank, but I do not think that means that it is only one party that is interested.",2,11,012-001-090-004-007-011,114

Singapore is the third fastest ageing population in the world. If we do not grow our population, we would become like Japan. With economic recession, higher taxes, and dwindling job opportunities – Japan, the fastest ageing country in the world, is paying the price for its ""closed door"" immigration policy. Some of their government and grassroots organisations have realised the negative effects of this closed-door policy. Now, they are trying to advocate welcoming immigrants through petition and open dialogues. Therefore, many countries are already considering relaxing the immigration policy to solve the population issues. We are a small nation.

When we go out during the weekends, the shopping malls and public places are thronged with people. The most pressing thing is the long queues in public hospitals and clinics.

It is inevitable that a bigger population will create more social problems. From the feedback gathered, we know the police would delay the non-emergency cases when there are more important and urgent cases. We have already outsourced the work of parking wardens. What else can we outsource? With a gradually ageing population, there would be more crimes targeted at elderly, such as fraud. Public security is very crucial to a nation.

In addition, more research and innovation projects should be dedicated to healthcare for the elderly, to enable our senior citizens to age gracefully and with dignity. With better and more affordable healthcare, the elderly can continue to be contributive citizens who help grow the economy, be it through direct means like working, or indirect means like sharing their experiences and nurturing grandchildren. Besides that, there should be more education for financial planning, plan to have sufficient savings for old age, plan to have sufficient medical insurance coverage for old age.

2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-015,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"On the topic of grandchildren, there has been a pessimistic outlook about how it is apparently too late to grow the population at the required speed even if Singaporeans were to start giving birth now. I think it is better late than never. The slew of pro-family measures in the Marriage and Parenthood package are highly encouraging. Nevertheless, we must also realise that money is not the only issue that is discouraging people from procreation. Many residents have confided in me their worries about how stressful life in Singapore is. Potential parents fear that increasing costs of university education and housing will make it difficult for their children to get good jobs or even a roof over their heads in the near future. The influx of foreigners and the perceived problems and competition drives them even further away from the decision of having children. On the other hand, singles are so tied down by their jobs that they hardly have time, or are simply too tired, to get out and mingle, let alone get married.",13,25,012-001-090-004-015-025,193

2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-015,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),The shortage of affordable public child care and infant care facilities must be addressed to create a family-oriented society. This can be done more efficiently by getting the involvement of employers. Employers who hire a certain number of employees perhaps should be made compulsory to provide childcare service in their premises of the workplace to their employees. Employers could be given incentives or reimbursements for the setting up cost of the child care centre.,15,27,012-001-090-004-015-027,195

2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-015,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"We are currently experiencing a shortage of teachers. With more foreigners settling down in Singapore and bringing their families, this shortage of teachers will become more severe. We will need to step up on the recruitment of more teachers. A high salary alone may not be a permanent solution as those who are in it for the money may quit after a few years on the job. For many teachers or ex-teachers I have spoken to, the heavy workload is a major problem that deters people from adopting teaching as a lifelong career. Teachers have to handle a myriad of non-teaching related work such as administrative work, co-curricular activities, school excursions and sometimes even counselling. A revision in the responsibilities of teachers should be considered to draw more quality candidates with passion into the profession.",17,29,012-001-090-004-015-029,197
2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-015,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Even at this point of time, xenophobic ""Us versus them"" sentiments are apparent, and lack of integration is the main culprit. The best place for integration would be in the schools. Unfortunately, the increasing number of foreigners has led to the establishment of international schools that cater to specific nationalities, and this impedes integration. These children will grow up among their own countrymen with little motivation for change and assimilation. Eventually, this leads to social segregation. Understandably, we cannot stop such schools from operating, but we can encourage organising of more inter-school activities and more exchange programmes between these schools and the public schools to facilitate socialisation and cultural immersion.",18,30,012-001-090-004-015-030,198

Because banking jobs are the jobs that Singaporeans would like to do. Can we not reserve the jobs that Singaporeans want, to Singaporeans first? Perhaps rope in e2i to help companies to fill their vacancies before they are allowed to employ foreigners. On the other hand, the SMEs who hired foreign workers to keep expenses low are experiencing difficulties coping with the increase in foreign worker levies. A balance needs to be sought − I know it is not easy − but it has to be done, ensuring that Singaporeans are getting good jobs while SMEs get time out to adjust to the increase in expenses. My stand on support for SMEs has always been clear – they need more assistance to increase productivity and reduce reliance on manpower.",21,33,012-001-090-004-015-033,201
2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-015,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"In the meantime, foreign worker levies should be moderated to allow them time to adapt. Rigidity should not apply to foreign worker levies when different industries and companies have different needs. By providing adequate support for SMEs, only then can we help our home brands to grow into successful companies that eventually provide more employment for Singaporeans. It is sad to see business owners having to turn away business because they cannot get the workers. I am appalled by the Workers' Party's proposal for zero growth for foreign workforce. Of course it is cool to say so. May I ask the Workers' Party what population figure we should use for the purpose of infrastructure planning? How are we going to build the 100,000 more new BTO flats without foreign workers? In fact, a lot of my friends in construction industry are crying now. Does it mean that my residents will have to wait longer in order to get their new BTO flats? Does it mean that our aged Singaporeans who need maids are not allowed to employ maids anymore? And who is to sweep our growing number of housing estates? I have many more BTO flats to be completed in the next few years. And what will happen to our healthcare? We are going to have more hospitals, more eldercare homes, and I have visited quite a lot of these homes for the elderly. In fact, they were also telling me that they really have difficulty. We want to build more such facilities and I am sure businesses will be affected, especially the SMEs.",22,34,012-001-090-004-015-034,202

Reasonably, the Government wishes to prevent such a situation from happening. But complaints about the country being run like a corporation are rampant.

As the last few years have shown us, GDP growth means little if Singaporeans are not the ones that benefit from it. GDP growth means little if Singaporeans cannot afford cars, and houses are out of reach.

But in this regard, the White Paper has not gone far enough to ask why Singaporeans are having fewer children. Mdm Speaker, in my view, a large part of this is down to a compendium of factors linked to our work culture, cost of living especially for the low and middle-income, and the sense of reducing physical space in Singapore. In the final reckoning, there is a confluence of factors, but rather than just look at more paternity leave and financial incentives, the White Paper was an opportunity for the Government to bite the bullet and introduce far-reaching changes to address our TFR problem for the long run.",5,42,012-001-090-004-015-042,210

Instead, by introducing a narrow set of measures, the Government has gone for a half-hearted approach, one that ultimately threatens a self-fulfilling prophecy. A less than vigorous attempt at raising TFR like what is currently presented in the White Paper will lead the Government to open the tap to immigration, on the grounds that measures to raise TFR have obviously failed.",7,44,012-001-090-004-015-044,212

Did they take the MRT? Perhaps some will. Whatever the case, I hope they do not choose to go to the beach over the weekend for it is simply too crowded today. Be that as it may, it is an inescapable reality that if one has a big family, one needs a car or some form of transport in Singapore – to bring kids to and from childcare, to take them out over the weekends, to meet their extended family, and for little excursions around the island. The MND Minister has come out to say that cycling should be encouraged. But it still does not change the fact that most families need a vehicle. It is my belief that the quality of life that is outlined in the White Paper with 6.5 million to 6.9 million Singaporeans will not deliver the high quality of life promised.",9,46,012-001-090-004-015-046,214

Housing estates are likely to be crammed, in line with the higher plot ratios in newer HDB estates and, yes, the rooms in our flats will continue to be small. On this account, I would like to ask if the Government had factored in the future size of our flats in this White Paper, as these increases are likely to go some way to creating a better sense of home and promoting larger families especially since the justification for smaller flats has been smaller families.",10,47,012-001-090-004-015-047,215

It is a well-known fact that culturally, many Singaporeans work late hours, effectively ridiculing the notion of an eight-hour workday. Shirley Sun, an academic at NTU in a 2013 publication titled ""Population Policy and Reproduction in Singapore  Making Future Citizens"", opined that ""encouraging childbirth among citizens is not solely a matter of providing economic resources or parental leave from work but in the construction of ideal citizens, and that if ‘individual competitiveness' reigns, particularly in the face of scarce resources, parents and prospective parents are likely to limit childbearing"".",11,48,012-001-090-004-015-048,216

Far from becoming productive, these employees, in the national schema, are singularly unproductive, spending time that could have been better spent with family.

It's time for the government to step in aggressively.

On this account, the jury is still out but Singaporeans remain uncomfortable at the thought of more foreigners coming on board even as new citizens slowly integrate into our society. This slow pace of integration should not come as a surprise to anyone. It's is not the fault of Singaporeans or new citizens. Integration takes time and if we have not been able to do it over the last 20 years with our population rising from 3 million to 5 million, it inevitable that this government will only increase the insecurity to Singaporeans if it proceeds with the population projection numbers set out in this White Paper.",16,53,012-001-090-004-015-053,221

While mention was made of communication in a common language to better ingrate new arrivals, no real direction was made to ensure new immigrants can effectively communicate in English, even though this feedback has been repeatedly put to the Government in light of our previously liberal immigration policy. A very telling sentence stated that there are ample opportunities for these wishing to learn English, such as courses run by, PA and NTUC. Why not encourage the economically inactive like the former teachers in our population to teach English and get them in the workforce, with the appropriate regulatory standards in place?

Bok identifies strengthening the family and marriage, encouraging active forms of leisure, cushioning the shock of unemployment, universal health care and a more secure retirement, improvements in child care and pre-school education, treatment of mental illnesses, focus of education policy and other broader goals.

As the economy matures, we cannot expect a high similar growth rate we have enjoyed in the past. We note that Japan's GDP has grown by 0.8% in the last decade but its GDP per capita actually increased by 1.6% because its labour force has also shrunk by close to 5% during the same period.

In addition, the size of Singapore GDP is only 1.7% of that of US, which is the largest economy in the world, 4.4% of Japan and 10.7% of UK. Singapore's economy does not have the same depth and breadth as other matured and larger economies. It is a fallacy to say that Singapore has arrived and should start using our reserves. We are not like Japan where their public debt is 245% of their GDP. They can still survive and people are still buying their government bonds.

The percentage of Category A COE, though it fluctuates slightly from period to period, has shrunk from 39% in 2002 to 24% of total COE quota, as shown in Table 3. For the same period, the percentage of combined Cat B and Cat E (which is used mainly for big cars above 1,600 cc) has increased from 33% in 2002 to 37% this year.",1,77,012-001-090-004-015-077,245

In short, the number of COEs available to buy big cars is 51% more than what is available to buy a small car. That is the main reason why Dr Lim Wee Kiak finds that in recent months, we could observe that the car agents are selling more Mercedes, BMW as compared to Toyota or Nissan. Thus, I suggest that MOT could consider allocating more COE to Cat A and less for Cat B and E because of two reasons  (a) Cat A buyers are more likely to be the working class people who need the car for small businesses, job requirements or to meet family needs; and (b) Cat B car buyers are more likely to be those who can afford and less price sensitive as well.",2,78,012-001-090-004-015-078,246

If you read The Business Times report on 7 November 2012 which publicised the number of COEs available from February 2013, it showed that a combined COE quota for Cat B and E is now 60% more than what is available in Cat A, for the six months period from February to July 2013. Hence, it is not sufficient to correct the anomaly by just adjusting the contribution in Cat E. It might be better for MOT to consider a one-time redistribution.",3,79,012-001-090-004-015-079,247

Moreover, many feel that they might lose their jobs or be forced to change industries as Singapore restructures its economy.

Why 40 years old? If we allow singles to buy new HDB flat early in age, this might indirectly encourage more Singaporeans to stay singles. Why 2-room flat? A 2-room flat is comfortable enough for one person to stay in a flat and probably not roomy enough to rent out one room.

Many of us want the Government to build more HDB flats. However, I am quite appalled to hear that someone wants to ask the construction industry to slow down. If the construction industry were to slow it down, it means that we will probably have less HDB flats, and fewer workers to build MRT lines and other infrastructures that Mr Pritam Singh was asking for.

If we are going to consider aggressive immigration policies, as a way to correct the problem of low TFR and replacement rates, we should also at the same time be considering more aggressive attempts to support the development of Singaporean families to boost the TFR. Even though we may not see the immediate effects of an increasing TFR till beyond 2030, we are talking about long term sustainable solution.

The Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) responded that this has to go by 2016 to make way for the Jalan Besar MRT and for commercial and residential purposes. Madam, this iconic place has existed in Singapore for more than 50 years and has become entrenched in the hearts of Singaporeans, even the younger ones today, as a place, even in all its messiness and quirkiness, has colour and meaning, and appeals to the heart. The letters to the press that ensued from my PQ, the Facebook posts and even a petition to save it, show that this place that MEWR describes as a ""temporary"" despite being in existence since the 1930s – thank you very much – which begs the question just what exactly is the meaning of ""temporary"", shows how people feel about the place, and to discount that in the name of development, to me, is a decision that comes from the head and not from the heart.",10,138,012-001-090-004-015-138,306

In the midst of all those numbers we were crunching, it is astonishing to me, Madam, that no mention was made at all on how these numbers impact on something bigger than ourselves − the Environment. We act as if all that economic growth, all those companies and talent that we want to entice, all the goodies that we want in life, all the construction that is going to happen, do not, in fact, come from somewhere and have to end up somewhere, in the environment. Yet, there is no mention in the White Paper about the impact of so many people on our carbon footprint, our food security – which, as it stands, we are almost 90% dependent on outside sources and what does it do to our vulnerability − the higher cost that Singaporeans have to bear in the years ahead as the pressure on water and energy mounts as we race towards the dream GDP.",11,139,012-001-090-004-015-139,307

Yes, it is important to have good infrastructure. Beyond the hardware, we need to build a strong Singapore core that share common values, world views, culture and a sense of identity.

2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-015,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Yesterday, Minister Grace Fu said the National Population and Talent Division (NPTD) is working with MOE to reduce stress and to provide holistic education for students. I am glad MOE wants every school to be a good school. However, MOE is struggling against many of their entrenched policies that have added unnecessary stress and cost to education. The Primary 1 registration gives priority to alumni, to those living in the immediate vicinities of schools and to parent volunteers. Getting children into what parents perceive as good schools is a stressful process. And while MOE tells parents that every school is good, parents know which schools are better. From MOE's data, we see that the results achieved by students at PSLE are vastly different across schools. Two days ago, we were told that median 2012 PSLE T-scores in schools range from 160 to 247, a wide difference in standards. So parents try very hard to get their children into what they perceive as better schools.",18,187,012-001-090-004-015-187,355
2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-015,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"Unnecessary examinations such as for giftedness add to parents pushing their children hard right from entry into primary schools. Secondary school admission is almost entirely based on the T-score achieved at the PSLE. Today, secondary schools and academic streams are highly differentiated. Students are sorted into schools of different status and into different academic streams. Parents push children hard at high stake examinations to get them into desired schools or to avoid certain academic streams. Often, they take leave from work to coach their children. Even Minister Grace Fu has said that she took leave to coach her children for the PSLE. Some get so exhausted in the process that they decide not to have more children.",19,188,012-001-090-004-015-188,356

A Sunday Times poll five years ago of 100 students showed that 97 of them had tuition. The situation is no better today. Parents even send children for tuition to get them into the gifted education programme because GEP has the Direct School Admission (DSA) advantage into top secondary schools.,20,189,012-001-090-004-015-189,357

Last month, the Government announced a slew of goodies in this area. I welcome the fact that the Government is willing to put more money into the industry. I had made various proposals in the adjournment motion on childcare last year. While a lot more money is now added, there is no change to the structure of the industry, which I consider is flawed. It is flawed because the industry is left to private market mechanisms. This is made worse by hugely disproportionate Government grants for a small number of Anchor Operators that gives them incredible advantages over other players in the industry.",23,192,012-001-090-004-015-192,360
2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-015,Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member),"I fear that the monies injected will inflate rents and fees. We had seen that before. In 2008, the Government doubled monthly subsidies to working mothers. Fees quickly went up after that. Under this new subsidy framework, the situation will be worse for higher income families. Those near to, or above $7,500 in monthly family income will get little or no additional subsidies. Private market forces will escalate fees. These parents will end up paying more for childcare. I hope the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) can consider making child care as a public good, with open competition for all and with fairer support for all operators. MSF is already spending a lot of money on infant and childcare. Reforming the industry may be a smarter and more efficient way to achieve affordable fees and high quality services with the same money. It will take away the uncertainty of childcare cost for young parents.",24,193,012-001-090-004-015-193,361

Dr Amy Khor has said our proposal will hurt businesses. Ms Jessica Tan asked if we had read the new reports that businesses are planning to leave. Yes, the economy will go through some pains but it is simplistic to say that slowing the manpower growth is what kills businesses. I know of businesses that have been killed not by lack of manpower, but by high rentals. The Government's policy on industrial land, for example, has caused huge spike in rents and land prices. Companies that need transport find it hard to afford vehicles due to high COE prices. The cost of many items has gone up. These are in part due to government policies and the overcrowding of Singapore. The Government certainly has scope to re-examine its policies and to see how else it can help businesses restructure in times like this",25,194,012-001-090-004-015-194,362

Our proposal is not zero growth. Our GDP projections are just 0.5% to 1% lower than the Government's. GDP growth of 1.5% to 3.5% is decent by the standard of matured economies. We have a 1% increase in residents workforce as well.,26,195,012-001-090-004-015-195,363

This is an incomplete picture. The tap leads into a plugged sink, that is already filled with quite a lot of water. There are 2.1 million residents and 1.3 million non-residents in our workforce. We have two taps. As foreigners leave for whatever reasons, we turn on the non-resident tap to fill it back up. We can try to get more out of the resident tap by increasing it at 1% per annum. If the resident tap cannot fulfil that, we turn on the non-resident tap. We are not leaving the sink dry. In contrast, the Government needs to be reminded that the sink is actually quite full. Having the taps turned on too fast will flood Singapore with a population that we will struggle to manage in the future.",27,196,012-001-090-004-015-196,364

I believe Mr Nair has forgotten that we are elected by the people to be in this House to establish policies and make laws, not to run businesses. This is precisely the problem I spoke about in my maiden speech in this House, that our Government runs many big businesses across our economy.

2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-015,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"It is also certainly bold for the Government to make public its planning consideration towards a 6.9 million population projection. The Workers' Party, as iterated by Member Pritam Singh earlier, has also taken the bold step of projecting a population target of 5.9 million in 2030. I agree that we face a tight infrastructure today. And, therefore, my view is that it is better to commit resources to ensure that we do not face the same issues today in 2030. Infrastructure cannot be built overnight. So, I ask, what is WP's position on what should be the parameters for population planning? As it stands, should the Government plan on a 6.9 million projected upper limit in 2030? Or should we plan based on a 5.9 million population projection and with future bottlenecks again? If we fail to plan sufficiently, we plan to fail.",3,212,012-001-090-004-015-212,380

I think the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) has got guidelines on fee increases. So is he asking for the Government not to give childcare subsidies or that all private centres close down and be taken over by the Government and be made public? We cannot in all honesty use Government funds to fund shareholders' profits. The anchor operators today are charity foundations, and I believe the right step is to increase the number of anchor operators, but we have to qualify and ensure that taxpayers' support in subsidies is met and used for the right reasons and not to line the pockets of private shareholders.",4,213,012-001-090-004-015-213,381

The White Paper also leaves Singaporeans with many other questions. What will our cost of living look like in 2030? Will Singapore still be an affordable place for my children? Can my children succeed and find their way in this Singapore 2030? What types of jobs and what kind of salaries can we expect by 2030?

I hope that the Government will consider a dedicated initiative in its population plan and put necessary research and resources. We have asked businesses to transform to adapt to the changing economic and manpower landscape. But, the Government also needs to be proactive to find ways to transform our cost structure and supply-side strategy to manage costs because our current strategies are not sustainable given our land constraints. What happens beyond 2030 if we get our land supply policies wrong?

2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-015,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"In fact, the Government should avoid statements that aim to compare our costs to other global cities as the primary indicator. Yesterday, I noted Transport Minister's statement that our public transport fares have not increased compared as much as other global cities. It is a credit that the Ministries try to keep our costs low by comparing to similar economies. But in addition to such comparisons, the Government should consider and share with the public how fares and other public costs are also benchmarked to increases in real wages, especially at the median and the lower income groups.",14,223,012-001-090-004-015-223,391
2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-015,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"So, we cannot just take a topline approach. I ask that the Government reconsider its KPIs and benchmarks to include how the various costs, whether it is public costs – transport costs, housing, food, recreation facilities - have affordability benchmarks pegged to real wage growth. Our strategy cannot be just about GDP growth, it should also be about real wage growth and household income growth. So, the Government needs to keep grounded to keep affordability and quality of living sustainable.",15,224,012-001-090-004-015-224,392
2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-015,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"On the business front, similarly, we should not simply benchmark our cost indices simply to the global cities. Their business dynamics are different and their economies are more mature with a larger proportion of local businesses that carry the local economy. So why is this important to Singaporeans? There is a link. If companies are not profitable, they are pressured not to pay Singaporeans well and not give bonuses and increments. If companies are under cost pressure, this is when they revert to lower-cost alternatives by using foreign labour and here is where wages may be depressed. Otherwise, companies may just move out of Singapore to find lower cost alternatives. So, my concern for the ordinary worker is that any productivity gains that the Government has pushed for so far may be lost to increases in rentals and other business costs.",16,225,012-001-090-004-015-225,393
2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-015,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"The Government needs to do more to help businesses manage their cost structure and help them derive more value add from our economy. To do so, the Government may also need to relook its revenue maximisation mantra for land use and value-add KPIs it expects from its agencies such as JTC, and its corporate spin-off, Ascendas. The business community perceives them as expensive sources of industrial property space rather than agencies that add value to their growth. This, despite the Government's best intentions to help our local businesses.

Of course, it was heartening that Ascendas has also ventured into Iskandar and I was asking if any of the businessmen were interested in exploring space with them. Many were of the impression, and likely, that Ascendas would be more expensive than some of the local industrial developers. So, if we take a purist free market approach even as a Government, we are not helping our SME businesses venture and grow. We need to take a differentiated approach to ensure that we continue to build and support quality growth of our SMEs.",18,227,012-001-090-004-015-227,395

They said they purchased a flat which was previously managed by JTC. So I asked, they must have gotten a good price for it? They said, no, JTC asked for $30,000 Cash-Over-Valuation (COV) upfront. So, I asked myself why does the Government need cash-over-valuation?

There are also limits to Government subsidy and tax rebates if costs are not managed effectively. We must find new ways of managing our cost structure.

I think this is a good phenomenon as it shows that Singaporeans are concerned with our future development and we love our homeland. If people do not care or give little or no responses to such important issues, then that will be a serious problem.

There is worry of how Singapore may change even as our national identity is being shade. The pragmatic Singaporean in all of us acknowledges that the Government has to plan ahead to deal with the double whammy of a low birth rate and an ageing population. However, the prospects of having more people and increase competition for resources naturally trigger red alerts.

For if we could re-invent ourselves, perhaps we could really avert the possibility of a 6.9 million population in 2030 where only 55% of the population are Singaporeans.

2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-015,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"One, re-defining prosperity. The conventional vision of social progress through endless growth has indeed come under increasing scrutiny across the world, according to Professor Tim Jackson from University of Surrey. Jackson, who is also economics commissioner on the UK government's Sustainable Development Commission, argues that economic growth may not infinitely deliver lasting prosperity. Instead, we need a more coherent vision of prosperity. This is especially so in the wake of the Eurozone problems and the anemic US recovery. To him, ""Prosperity, in any meaningful sense of the term, is really about the quality of our lives and relationships, about the resilience of our communities, and about our sense of individual and collective meaning.""",6,275,012-001-090-004-015-275,443
2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-015,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"It is the desire for ""wholesome"" growth what Singaporeans want? We are now all experiencing a post-material age where youngsters tell us that they place work-life balance above economic gains. Discussions about the White Paper have posed soul-searching questions on what constitutes success, happiness and growth. Could ""prosperity"" for Singaporeans take on new meaning? The London-based public policy body, Legatum Institute, has created a unique ""Prosperity Index"" that assesses national prosperity based on wealth and wellbeing. Its prosperity indicators are economy, entrepreneurship opportunities, governance, education, health, safety and security, personal freedom and social capital.",7,276,012-001-090-004-015-276,444
2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-015,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"Are some of these factors the values that Singaporeans associate prosperity with? As Our Singapore Conversations take place, perhaps we can ask participants for their views on what ""prosperity"" means to each of them and collectively. For instance, could ""prosperity"" mean having more time to make babies and watch them grow, but perhaps for each and every one of us with less pay and opportunities? And if this were so, would Singaporeans be ready to accept a slower or even no growth in the future? Or even the possibility of fewer jobs?",8,277,012-001-090-004-015-277,445
2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-015,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"Two, the second point I want to raise is about reviewing the model of engagement. We all know jobs are crucial to any country. The urgency to attract investments and high-value jobs into Singapore has always kept us on our toes. We need Singapore to stay relevant, globally competitive and attractive to investors, MNCs, SMEs and entrepreneurs. New growth areas and nascent industries offer good potential and high value jobs to Singaporeans. However, due to the nascent stage of these industries, specialised skills are required. This leads to such companies broadening their search for talent beyond Singaporeans. For example, Manufacturing Integrated Technology, a company dealing in solar energy, revealed that its biggest obstacle was not business costs, but the shortage of talent. In The Straits Times article on 16 January 2013, the company's CEO said that ""the firm is sorely lacking qualified engineers"". While 80% of this company's workforce is local, the company had to tap on foreign manpower to fill a 20% gap.",9,278,012-001-090-004-015-278,446
2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-015,Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang),"Are we the victims of our own success? Perhaps it is time for us to consider re-calibrating the forces of demand with the supply of our local talent pool. The high-value jobs created by investments coming into Singapore are creating a demand at the nascent stage that our locals find hard to meet. The White Paper recognises this gap and has tried to plug it by allowing businesses to hire foreigners.

Knowledge transfer needs to take place more quickly and more nimbly. Furthermore, could we also consider having the economic agencies hard wiring into our incentives for companies – the key criteria of hiring a set number of Singaporeans – in order to qualify for Government assistance?",11,280,012-001-090-004-015-280,448

They do not currently take into account many years of experience that mature workers can contribute to the workforce. I hope the Government, the various agencies, can consider factoring in such considerations as it reviews the kinds of businesses and industries that Singapore will pursue and continue to develop in the future.

In fact today's media and the modern culture worships beauty and youth. And this has really spilled over to businesses and workforce.

MOM and WDA can work with ministries and agencies to review and draw up available positions with roles which are suitable for mature workers. For instance, in the areas of healthcare, eldercare, childcare and even social services – these are the new growth areas that need to ramp up capacity, we all hear. They have huge demand for manpower. So, in these sectors can we consider identifying or even redesign specific jobs in these sectors that are well suited for mature workers. This should be work that should not be physically demanding, but it also should be work that will draw upon our mature Singaporeans' strengths – in fact, they have very extensive life experiences. Jobs like healthcare or administrative assistants, carers for the elderly, nannies or childcare educarers, or even counsellors, social service jobs – are possible roles for our mature Singaporeans.",16,285,012-001-090-004-015-285,453

It is an important reminder for all of us to plan ahead and invest in the infrastructure in a coordinated and timely manner.

We were caught wrong-footed and we caused Singaporeans much discomfort. That is why this time round, we have to plan infrastructure based on the stretched scenario of 6.9 million.

For my daily exercises, the physiotherapist requires me to pump up my heart, but not to exceed 125, and to sustain it for at least fifteen minutes, which I do daily. As Members know, I am a very disciplined chap. This should hopefully keep my heart in good condition. For the biannual stress test, the doctor requires me to pump the heart up to 165 beats per minute. 165 is way above my daily exercise 125. But this will enable the doctor to check how my heart functions at a heightened stress level.

The southern waterfront will be the western extension of the CBD. The CBD, the eastern wing, the western wing and together offer scope and opportunities bigger, greater and much more than Marina Bay. It is an exciting – or the young people like to say ""awesome"" – vision, and it is totally within our grasp. What I do not know is whether I will live to see it completed.

So people will naturally draw from their own memory, from their own encounters in the crowded train, the traffic jam, the long wait for the HDB flat – and wonder what it might be like if it were to be 30% worse.

The Government has been working very hard to address these concerns, but that still remains very much a work in progress. Yet, we are now being asked to endorse a plan that could see us share that limited space with more people – many of them foreigners, such that the Singaporean citizen population drops to 55%.",4,341,012-001-090-004-015-341,509

That is good, and it gives young expectant couples a leg up. But we must recognise that the decision to start a family is not just about financial incentives or rewards or even parenthood leave. The entire parenthood eco-system and the infrastructure for bringing up children have to be reviewed and encouraged – not just about the availability of childcare centres or Foreign Domestic Worker levies, housing, education, work-place environment ethics, reforms, changes to tax structure and so on.",23,366,012-001-090-004-015-366,534

The Marriage and Parenthood Package can only take us so far. I would propose that the Government considers setting up a specialist committee tasked specifically to look into revamping these measures. Go well beyond the present paradigm. A starting point could be to study the Swedish family policies. I know there is a different dynamic there and a different ethic consideration but in Sweden, family policies are placed as a priority and are co-ordinated with educational and flexible labour market policies.

The debate, however, should not end there, and I urge the Government to continue to consult and receive views and refine the projections in this Paper, both Papers. It should be a dynamic process. The Government should continually review the implications of the policy not only in terms of the big picture, but also the small.

Because it means jobs, food, homes, clothes, schools, medical services, roads, trains and all the necessities and niceties of life. We pay attention to economic growth in order to create good jobs for fresh graduates and school-leavers, provide security for workers, accumulate resources to subsidise housing, health care and education, help the lower-income Singaporeans through schemes like Workfare, and save for the future. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is an economic indicator to sum up the economic activities within a country. Pursuing GDP growth is a means to get a good harvest for Singaporeans.

No one wants to hit 6.9 million people. Every Member in this House wants a stronger core of Singaporeans. Everyone supports the Government building ahead of demand. We all want TFR measures to work so that there will be less dependence on foreigners. Future technology and advances in health care may well help our seniors remain active and productive longer. Other innovations and mechanisation may reduce our dependence on unskilled labour. Technology can change life dramatically in the next 20 years, just as it has done in the last 20 years.

But that means different things to different people. To most Singaporeans, day-to-day issues weigh most on their minds. So, how will the building of new MRT lines and housing make our lives better if we are, at the same time, growing the population? Will the added capacity only be sufficient to cater to the increased population? In basic terms, will Singaporeans have to wait longer, shorter or the same time for their flat or the next train?

It is easy to discount projected population figures by a million or so, and then say that the workforce shortfall will somehow be made up by foreign brides and productivity, then we can simply decide how many per cent of GDP we want, as if we can push it with a magic machine, and then we can all live happily ever after with lower growth. There is a difference between a vision and a fairy tale. We have to compare something with something, and this debate will not be advanced or served by comparing Singapore, as envisioned in the White Paper, with something that only exists in fiction.",19,425,012-001-090-004-015-425,593

And I do not mean simply throwing numbers around. Let us deal with the real effects on real Singaporeans. For example, what will low growth mean to employment opportunities for young Singaporeans? All around the world today, youth unemployment is increasing at alarming rates. The ILO 2012 report puts ""Youth Unemployment for Developed Economies and the European Union"" at 18% in 2011 and about the same this year. In Spain and Italy, as of July 2012, youth unemployment was 52% and 35% respectively. This is because businesses are not investing or growing, and cannot absorb the many young people who are graduating from schools every year. Why do some assume Singapore will be different? Businesses in Singapore will not invest and expand if labour is tight and growth is low. To say that we can have the same growth as other mature economies is no answer as it ignores the problems that these other economies have today.",20,426,012-001-090-004-015-426,594

These are important to the daily lives of Singaporeans. Under the Workers' Party plan, there will not be enough, and it is a pipe dream to believe that Singaporeans alone will make up the difference. These and other questions have to be answered if there is to be a credible alternative or, at least, a meaningful debate. It is not enough to simply say that there has to be ""structural changes"". It is clearly not enough to say you empathise with local SMEs, which you kill off with your plans, and then say it is for the Government to find a solution to help them.

This in the short run allows the working population base to remain constant, and to support the ageing population. However, I wish to highlight two major drawbacks with this recommendation. Firstly, there is nothing that will stop immigrants who come to Singapore and swear their allegiance to this tiny nation from moving to another greener pasture. This is especially so if we are unable to remain attractive to these immigrants. Secondly, there is a high possibility that these immigrants who settle down in Singapore will want to have their parents migrate here as well. This is especially true – for one-child families from China – as with our safe environment, many will want to bring their elderly parents over and care for them in their silver years. I am sure many of us have received similar requests for Long Term Visit Passes, permanent residency or citizenship for these family members at our weekly Meet-the-People Session (MPS).",10,440,012-001-090-004-015-440,608

On the one hand, we need new immigrants to maintain our edge, productivity and economic growth, yet on the other they may very well contribute to the woes of an ageing population.

We should not simply turn to the easy quick fix solution of immigration alone.",28,458,012-001-090-004-015-458,626

Member, Mr Liang Eng Hwa, I urge the Government to quickly address the many hot button issues of infrastructural deficiencies, escalating property prices and the high cost of living. These are issues that Singaporeans are facing in our day-to-day lives.

The Boiling Frog story is a widespread anecdote describing a frog slowly being cooked to death. The premise is that if a frog is placed in boiling water, it will instinctively jump out. But if it is placed in cold water that is progressively heated up, the frog will not perceive the danger and will be boiled to death unknowingly.",30,460,012-001-090-004-015-460,628

We do not want to be like the frog in the parable, deceived into thinking that our lives will remain good and cushy, like relaxing in a warm jacuzzi bathtub. It will be extremely irresponsible to think that everything will be fine in the next 10 to 20 years, if we do nothing or little to address the issues facing us. With that, I support the amended motion.",31,461,012-001-090-004-015-461,629

I welcome the assurance from our Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and various Ministers that the projection numbers are just that − projections − to ensure that our infrastructure investment is sufficient for keeping Singapore as one of the most liveable cities in the world. Hence, I support Mr Liang Eng Hwa's amendments which clarify this paper in the right perspective.",1,462,012-001-090-004-015-462,630

2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-015,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"With help from the United Nations, Singapore's first Concept Plan was formed in 1971 to guide our land planning for the following 20 years. In 1971, we had a population of 2.1 million. A major review of the 1971 Concept Plan was undertaken and completed in 1991. It stressed quality, identity and variety when planning for a population of 4 million. In 1991, our population was 3.1 million. Another review was completed in 2001 based on the ""long term population parameter of 5.5 million"". The Concept Plan was not specific about when we were projected to reach that number. At that time in 2001, we had reached 4.1 million people. A mid-term review was conducted in 2006 and the long-term population parameter was raised to 6.5 million in view of population trends and economic developments.",3,464,012-001-090-004-015-464,632
2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-015,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Today, many Singaporeans have expressed concerns, even unease, over the White Paper's projected population of 6.9 million in 17 years. I do not think there were such intense reactions in 1971, 1991 and 2001, when the respective figures were projected. If we look at the percentage increase of the projected figure against the existing population at the point in time, it was 29% in 1991, 34% in 2001 and 30% now in 2013. These increases have been quite close. There are probably a few reasons why we are hearing the sentiments today ",4,465,012-001-090-004-015-465,633
2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-015,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Firstly, the pace of increase is getting quicker. The White Paper is referring to 17 years from now. Most people see ourselves still around to either enjoy the better environment, or suffer the bigger squeeze for common space and opportunities. Whereas in 2001, when the projected increase was the highest at 34%, it was over a period of 40 to 50 years. Even I wonder if I would be around in 2050. However, the pace of development in the world is quickening. The Prime Minister has been very upfront in admitting that the Government did not have 20/20 vision over the last decade. It is indeed getting more difficult to plan really long term as the world, including Singapore will experience many and more frequent changes in future.",5,466,012-001-090-004-015-466,634
2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-015,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Secondly, people are also questioning if the population increase is the way for continual growth. A 12-storey block was considered a high rise building in the 1970s, now we have flats at the 50th floor. I am sure technology will allow 100-storey blocks to be built en masse in the future. We can live higher up, we can go underground, we can reclaim more land. However, is there a limit to how many can live in our little island state? There is a fundamental question about the growth or sustenance model for Singapore.",6,467,012-001-090-004-015-467,635

People just cannot fathom that things will get better before the grand vision of the 2030 materialises.",7,468,012-001-090-004-015-468,636
2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-015,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"Sir, that is why it is extremely bold, and some may even say foolish for the Government to want to subject itself to full scrutiny by laying down its cards to try to explain itself and take up the uphill task of convincing the populace. It could have chosen to be silent on the projection number or the timeframe. It could have just rolled out the grand plans for the new nature spaces, new MRT lines, new housing estates to make everyone happy.",8,469,012-001-090-004-015-469,637
2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-015,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"However, Singaporeans today want greater transparency; they want to express their views, and want their voices heard. This is what an educated population and a more mature society expects. This is the process that we are going through now and we have to go through. It is appropriate to put forth projection figures for further discussions and debates. It is a move in the right direction since we want to encourage more active citizenry and participation from Singaporeans. Only this way, can we collectively decide our future and make conscientious choices between trade-offs. Let us keep an open mind, understand the issues at hand, accept the constraints and face the challenges as we have as a people, both for our generation and future generations.",9,470,012-001-090-004-015-470,638

For example, if the child has one sibling, he would be eligible for Phase 2B, and if he has two, he can register at Phase 2A, and maybe for those with three or more siblings, Phase 1 priority is given. This will also encourage parents to have more babies earlier, before their eldest reach seven years old. In support of intact families, the child and his siblings must have the same parents.",14,475,012-001-090-004-015-475,643

Most of them were middle-aged, lowly-educated blue-collared workers, some without fixed incomes. This group of Singaporeans are fully aware that they are not very eligible, and have difficulties getting a girlfriend. Some of them even gave up the idea of getting married and were prepared to remain single and lonely for the rest of their lives. In recent years, more and more people tried to look for spouses in neighbouring countries. Just like any other men, they just wanted to have a companion to grow old together or to raise the children or to have someone to help them take care of their elderly parents.",18,479,012-001-090-004-015-479,647

Thus, they chose to leave their home country to search for a better life and marry a Singaporean spouse. In a way, they are quite similar to our forefathers who decided to move southwards to settle here many years ago. In my interaction with them, I find that they are typically good wives and mothers.

It is about the direction we want to take. The kind of Singapore we want. Is it fully open for business? Is it partially open? Or is it totally closed? It is quite clear to us that it cannot be fully opened as we were before. We are running; smack into our resource constraints and the pace of change is too fast for people to adjust. To be totally closed would be a disaster, even for a few years as the Workers' Party had suggested. Business will close, jobs lost. Once businesses decide to leave, it is unlikely that they will come back.",8,44,012-001-090-004-017-044,716
2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-017,Mr Mah Bow Tan (Tampines),"We would have thrown away one of our key competitive advantages  a consistent, investor-friendly approach to business. We would very quickly wither into irrelevance. Which leaves us with the balance option  let in some foreign labour to supplement our local workforce, but not as much as before. Businesses would want more, some people would want less. The numbers can be collaborated. I support this. I say go for the maximum that our resources – land, water, energy can support; whatever that numbers.",9,45,012-001-090-004-017-045,717
2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-017,Mr Mah Bow Tan (Tampines),"It shows that Singapore is an attractive place, a thriving, a vibrant city, one where people want to come here; live and work and play. If we lose our competitiveness, we lose our verve and vitality, our cohesion and confidence. Not only will we not have foreigners wanting to come here, our own sons and daughters will leave for a better life. Which brings me to my other point.",10,46,012-001-090-004-017-046,718
2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-017,Mr Mah Bow Tan (Tampines),"In this debate, we have spent a lot of our time looking inwards; talking about our discomforts, our space. We have not asked ourselves how we are going to compete with the outside world. How we are going to earn a living to live a good life? It is almost taken for granted that the good life will continue even if growth slows. We expect new infrastructure to be rolled even if growth slows. More houses, more rail lines. We want more subsidies for healthcare and housing. But, ""please, let's have less foreign workers and a slower pace of life"".",11,47,012-001-090-004-017-047,719

I looked for some indication of this in the White Paper and I found it in small print in a footnote on page 31. It says and I quote, ""Government revenue comes mostly from income taxes, consumption taxes and asset taxes all of which are dependent on economic growth"". I think this should be in bold. I think it should be highlighted in a box and not put in a footnote.",12,48,012-001-090-004-017-048,720

2013-02-06,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-004-017,Mr Mah Bow Tan (Tampines),"I visit China regularly for business. Every time I come back from China, I get worried for Singapore. The young people are getting more and more educated. Every year, they produce more than 6 million graduates. But there are not enough good jobs for them, so they are thirsty for knowledge, they are hungry for success. They are willing to work long and hard for their rewards. I was in Tsinghua University in Beijing recently and I met with some students. I could see the drive and the tremendous energy oozing out of them. They are our competitors, not just the foreign students who are studying here. This is happening not only in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai but all across China.",14,50,012-001-090-004-017-050,722

They range from provincial level cities like Beijing and Shanghai to prefectural level ones like Wuhan, even Dalian and Qingdao. All of them are our potential competitors. They are attracting investments in high tech areas like biotech, like digital animation, like optics, renewable energy.

Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines have started to move. They complement us but they also compete. So which will dominate? It really depends on us. Further afield, developments will also affect us. Will the US new found access to cheap energy make their manufacturing more competitive and less reliant on cheaper overseas plant? Will Europe be able to recover quickly from its economic woes? All these issues affect us profoundly. We cannot influence how they turn out but we can position ourselves so that we ride the wave with them, and not be caught in the tide and drown.",16,52,012-001-090-004-017-052,724

We are still a small city-state, in fact, we are a tiny city-state. We still do not have oil or gas, gold or diamonds. Our politics may have entered a ""new normal"" but our need to earn a living through our wits, our hard work, and our need to be useful to the world – that has not changed.

2013-02-06,Licences for Private Bus Operators,012-001-090-004-020,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked the Minister for Transport whether the Ministry will (i) issue licences to other private operators to fill the gaps in the provision of bus services; and (ii) review the bus routes operated by SMRT and SBS Transit to create intended competition on same routes and improve efficiency.,1,1,012-001-090-004-020-001,735
2013-02-06,Licences for Private Bus Operators,012-001-090-004-020,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"  The Public Transport Council regularly reviews the various schemes that licence private bus operators to provide services that complement the public bus network. For instance, guidelines for Premium Bus Services were reviewed to encourage operators to provide more direct connections to work places. The Shuttle Bus Service scheme was also enhanced to make it easier for operators to run short routes to areas where basic bus services are unable to meet the needs of residents. Today, there are 90 Premium Bus Services run by 21 different licensees, and 83 Shuttle Bus Services run by 37 licensees. We will continue to review whether more and different types of non-basic public transport bus services can be implemented to better serve the needs of local communities.",1,2,012-001-090-004-020-002,736

We will look into such issues in the longer term, but our immediate priority is to improve bus service levels and inject more buses and routes to improve capacity and connectivity, amongst others through the Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP).",2,3,012-001-090-004-020-003,737
