2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"asked the Minister for Education (a) from 2011 to 2021, what is the annual number of cases of mental distress or psychiatric issues reported by teaching staff in (i) Primary schools, Secondary schools and Junior Colleges, (ii) Institutes of Technical Education, (iii) Polytechnics, and (iv) Autonomous Universities; and (b) in light of the next normal of living with COVID-19 and home-based learning in 2020/2021 and beyond, what is the Ministry doing to alleviate the stress encountered by teaching staff.",1,1,014-001-095-042-001-001,1
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Dr Wan Rizal,"asked the Minister for Education (a) since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, whether there has been an increase in a teacher’s workload and blurring of lines between work and personal time; (b) whether steps have been taken to measure the mental health index of our teachers; and (c) whether there are efforts to ensure that our teachers are not overwhelmed and suffer from burnout.",1,2,014-001-095-042-001-002,2

2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Speaker,"  Yes, please.",1,4,014-001-095-042-001-004,4
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"  Our teaching staff have shouldered a heavy responsibility to ensure that our students can continue learning safely during this COVID-19 pandemic. Workload for teaching staff has increased as they are responsible for ensuring that students are educated about and comply with the safe management measures. Each time a confirmed case is notified, staff need to follow-up on contact tracing and communications. When home-based learning (HBL) was declared, teaching staff also needed to make the necessary arrangements, with additional support for students who may not adjust as well to HBL. All these efforts are necessary to allow teaching and learning to continue, despite the pandemic.",1,5,014-001-095-042-001-005,5
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"To keep track of staff sentiments and well-being, MOE conducts dipstick polls, school visits by senior management and engagement surveys. The Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) also conduct surveys and staff engagements with leaders.",2,6,014-001-095-042-001-006,6
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"MOE and the IHLs have put in place measures to address the concerns raised by staff on workload. At the system-level, MOE has reprioritised initiatives and reduced schools’ involvement in HQ work and pilots.",3,7,014-001-095-042-001-007,7
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Schools have also been given greater flexibility to pace the implementation of selected initiatives, including deferring implementation, if it helps to spread out staff workload. For example, Secondary schools and JCs were given the option to defer the implementation of Blended Learning to 2022 instead of Term 3 of 2021, as originally planned.",4,8,014-001-095-042-001-008,8
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"At the school-level, we recognise that ground practices may vary. We have called on school leaders to reprioritise school programmes, establish clear expectations on teachers’ availability and work hours and encourage supervisors to check in with their officers regularly. For example, school leaders have been providing guidance on avoiding parent-staff communications after school operating hours except for urgent matters, such as those involving the safety and well-being of students. This can minimise the blurring of lines between work and personal time.",5,9,014-001-095-042-001-009,9
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In line with the streamlined health protocols, ring-fencing policies and contact tracing processes in schools have now also been significantly simplified and teachers’ workload related to COVID-19 management is being reduced.",6,10,014-001-095-042-001-010,10
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Similarly, the IHLs have implemented various measures tailored to their institutions, such as reprioritisation of work tasks, to reduce workload and setting clearer expectations that staff need not reply to work emails after office hours unless there are exigencies.",7,11,014-001-095-042-001-011,11
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"To support staff who need help, MOE provides free counselling services. In addition, MOE, Polytechnic and ITE staff who are public officers can access the whole-of-Government counselling hotline. Staff in the Autonomous Universities have access to either in-house or external counselling services. Before COVID-19, about 50 staff from our schools sought support from MOE’s in-house counsellors annually. The annual number has increased to about 80 since 2020. Similarly, the number of IHL teaching staff seeking counselling support has increased. We do not have more detailed data, as information from all counselling sessions is kept confidential and staff are not required to report mental distress or psychiatric issues.",8,12,014-001-095-042-001-012,12
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"We recognise the exceptional demands that COVID-19 has placed on our staff and have put in additional effort to promote a positive and supportive work environment for staff well-being across schools and IHLs, such as organising workshops covering stress management and self-care. As part of a new well-being initiative since September 2021, schools have nominated Wellness Ambassadors for staff to receive training on how to provide basic peer support and encourage their peers to seek help. Training has commenced in end-October. Some IHLs are implementing similar initiatives.",9,13,014-001-095-042-001-013,13

Learning teams within and across schools also allow staff to collaborate and share good practices on the design and delivery of online lessons.",10,14,014-001-095-042-001-014,14
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,The well-being of our staff is of paramount importance and MOE and the IHLs will continue to strengthen our support for staff to help ensure their well-being.,11,15,014-001-095-042-001-015,15

2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),  I thank the Minister for his reply and note the sensitivity of some of the information. I have three supplementary questions for the Minister.,1,17,014-001-095-042-001-017,17
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"Firstly, yes, we are aware and we thank MOE for the various mitigation measures to help lighten the stress and mental distress of teachers as well as educators across our educational institutions. The first question is, what are the further concrete steps that MOE can take to reduce further pressures from various stakeholders, non-essential workload and support better work-life harmony, so that teachers and educators can also attend to their loved ones?",2,18,014-001-095-042-001-018,18
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"The second supplementary question is, can I suggest to the Minister that school leaders, especially, set the tone to look after the well-being of teachers, staff and educators in operationalising MOE's policies as well as meeting the schools' expectations?",3,19,014-001-095-042-001-019,19
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"My third supplementary question is, to overcome mental health and well-being issues, can I ask MOE HQ and educational institutions alike to work closely with our teachers as well as with teachers' and education's cluster of unions to better manage this issue on the ground, as we hear it is brewing; and in addition, also partnering the community and building the right societal values, especially as we move and chart the way forward in the next normal?",4,20,014-001-095-042-001-020,20
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"  Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Mr Patrick Tay for his questions and, more importantly, for his concerns for the welfare and well-being of our teachers. I should say a couple of things to set the context as I answer the three supplementary questions from Mr Patrick Tay.",1,21,014-001-095-042-001-021,21
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"First, I think we should all thank our teachers and educators because, over the last two years, it has really been very tough on them. We are one of the few systems in the entire world that have managed to keep our schools going and to allow our students to continue learning with minimum disruptions during the last two years. So, I really want to say a big ""Thank You"" to all our teachers for going all out.",2,22,014-001-095-042-001-022,22
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Not many of us realise that in order to keep our school system going, the workload for our teachers has more than doubled. In order for us to switch seamlessly from physical schooling to home-based learning, our teachers need to spend a lot of time preparing more than two sets of lesson plans  one set of lesson plans for the school, the physical schooling; and one set of lesson plans for the home-based learning, just in case we need to switch over seamlessly. On top of that, to be able to take care of the higher-needs students who would still need to return to the school during the home-based learning period.",3,23,014-001-095-042-001-023,23
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On top of all this, the school leaders and teachers also have to perform the role of contact tracing in case there are cases in the school. We have to do this without additional manpower support. We have seen the challenges that even MOH, together with the support of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), had and how big a challenge this can be. So, all the more, I am deeply appreciative of the efforts by our teachers.",4,24,014-001-095-042-001-024,24
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Over the course of the last two years, be it the vaccination programme or the mental and social emotional stresses experienced by our students and their families, many of these will culminate in their experiences in the school, which our teachers also have to manage.",5,25,014-001-095-042-001-025,25
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"With that at the back of our mind, what can we do as a society to help our teachers manage? Because they are, ultimately, not only teachers but they are also fellow Singaporeans. They also have families that they need to take care of.",6,26,014-001-095-042-001-026,26
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I would like to answer the three supplementary questions from Mr Patrick Tay in three parts  what are things that we can do in the short term, things that we can do in the longer term and things that we, as a whole-of-society, can do together to better support our teachers. The fundamental belief is this  if our teachers are well taken care of, they will be able to take care of all our children well. But if our teachers are not well taken care of, if they are not in the best condition, then it is also very difficult for us to expect them to take good care of our children, our students.",7,27,014-001-095-042-001-027,27
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In the short term, as I have mentioned, we have adjusted various programmes in order to lighten the workload of our teachers. We have adjusted the schedule as to how we roll out new programmes. We have given the schools some of the flexibility to adjust the scheduling, for example, the implementation of blended learning. And for the Full Subject-Based Banding roll-out, we will have to make some adjustments in order to alleviate the workload on our teachers.",8,28,014-001-095-042-001-028,28
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The second thing that we can do in the short term is to use technology for us to scale up the lessons, especially for home-based learning. While in the long term, this will help to lighten the workload of our teachers, in the short term, it actually requires our teachers to do more because we have to switch over from the current physical schooling curriculum to the online curriculum. Many of our teachers will need to learn new skills. But our hope is that, over the longer term, as we leverage technology to scale up the lesson preparation and even some of the class sizes, then we will be able to devote more time to the higher-needs students.",9,29,014-001-095-042-001-029,29
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Overall, as a system, it is quite unrealistic for us to expect that we can double the amount of resources overnight. In order to focus more attention and bandwidth on the high-needs students, we will need to find other ways to scale up our curriculum teaching so that we can save some time and bandwidth on the other areas where we can.",10,30,014-001-095-042-001-030,30
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The third thing in the short term that we have done is to insert what we call surgical breaks into the term time so that, in case there is a spike in the number of cases where the workload is very high, we can give our teachers a slight break. An example of this is, this year, Term 4, where we took one extra day to declare it as a school holiday after the PSLE marking. That one extra day would have given us a period of about nine days continuously for some of our teachers to take a bit of a break and to spread out their load during the PSLE marking. These are things that we will continue to do.",11,31,014-001-095-042-001-031,31
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The fourth thing that we are doing is to make sure that when MOE communicates with our teachers, we do it systematically. We know that this is a large system that operates with 50,000 educators, more than half a million students. We try not to make too many changes too quickly. This allows time for the teachers and the school leadership teams to make the necessary adjustments.",12,32,014-001-095-042-001-032,32
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"In the longer term, we would need to do much more to help our teachers cope. One is to use technology to scale up our teaching resources so that we can, as I have mentioned, apply the time more surgically to the higher-needs students.",13,33,014-001-095-042-001-033,33
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The second thing that we can do to better equip our teachers to manage this is to equip them with the skillsets to detect potential mental health issues among the students and their fellow peers. We are applying it, starting from the National Institute of Education (NIE) curriculum, all the way to their professional development and continuing training. So, these are things we will do over the longer term.",14,34,014-001-095-042-001-034,34
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Over the longer term, I would also like to see our teachers systematically given a break or sabbatical, whereby they can go out and recharge themselves. And not just to recharge themselves but also for them to acquire new perspectives, new skills, new connections to bring back to the school. That is my wish over the long term and we will progressively roll this out.",15,35,014-001-095-042-001-035,35
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Finally, can I say that to better support our teachers, we really need a whole-of-society approach. Let me say this  I think our teachers work very hard; they care a lot for our students. I do not think our teachers are afraid to work hard. But in working hard, they must be given a sense of agency, that they are in control, that they are doing things with conviction. That is important. And this is why I keep emphasising that no matter how hard our teachers and school leaders work, they must feel that they are in control, with a sense of agency. They can take charge of things, they can customise the curriculum according to the needs of their students, because every school has a different profile of students and no two children are similar. We need to allow teachers and school leaders that autonomy to customise the programmes according to their school needs, according to their students' needs.",16,36,014-001-095-042-001-036,36

2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,,"The second thing that I think I would say is that we, as a whole-of-society, must also help our teachers in a form of partnership. I will give a very simple example. Our teachers care a lot, many of our teachers even give their handphone numbers to their students, just in case their students get into trouble outside school hours. And I have heard many stories of our students, sometimes calling the teachers in the middle of the night because they got kicked out of home, because of family issues and our teachers respond. This is the extent to which our teachers go, to take care of our students beyond the curriculum time in school.",2,38,014-001-095-042-001-038,38
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,,"But in giving out their handphone numbers to the families and the students, we also hope that the families will not abuse the trust. It is one thing for the child to call up the teacher at midnight to say that he is in trouble. It is another thing for the parent to call up the teacher at midnight to ask whether tomorrow the child has spelling and should wear a red or blue T-shirt. If the child does not remember, so be it. It is part of his learning experience. We, as parents, do not need to overly protect our children and deprive them of the learning experience.",3,39,014-001-095-042-001-039,39
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,,"I think we need to establish this clear understanding as expectations of parents and society, and that of ourselves, get heightened, a lot of expectations are projected onto our teachers as well. That is why we need to strengthen this partnership. This is the reason why I want to strengthen the partnership between the schools and the parents support groups, not so much just for the parents support groups to support the schools, but also for the parents support groups to support one another in helping one another set the correct expectations, so that we can have a strong partnership between parents and teachers in bringing up our children.",4,40,014-001-095-042-001-040,40
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,,"Last but not least, I would say this  in the COVID-19 situation, there are many changes. We may not be perfect and we will not be perfect. All of us can pull together and help one another overcome some of the imperfections that we are facing. Sometimes, we have to make changes. Sometimes, we have to make changes at the last minute because of the circumstances. But all of us can pull together and help one another. For example, some families prefer HBL, some families prefer physical schooling. There will not be a situation where we can meet the needs of everyone.",5,41,014-001-095-042-001-041,41
2021-11-02,Mental Distress or Psychiatric Issues Reported by Teaching Staff in Schools and Institutes of Higher Learning,014-001-095-042-001,,"But we can all help one another, that when we do not get the things that we want for ourselves, for our families, let us not burden the teachers with the excessive demands on the teachers to try and fulfil our own personal needs. That, I think, will go a long way in helping our teachers cope as well. One of the common feedback from our teachers is that most of our parents are very supportive of our teachers, but there is a small minority of parents who place a very huge demand on our teachers. It is perhaps unfair for the teachers if they are unable to spend their time and take care of all the students because of the high demands placed on them by a very small group of parents.",6,42,014-001-095-042-001-042,42

And I thank Minister Chan for sharing about the short- and long-term perspectives of supporting teachers. I think our Government has always been very good with adopting technology enablement to support all our civil and public servants. We have always done very good on that front. But Minister Chan has also acknowledged that a lot of the stress that the teachers feel come from students reaching out to them, things that happen outside of the classroom.",1,45,014-001-095-042-001-045,45

I would like to ask the Minister whether any of the support plans that MOE has rendered to teachers can involve none of them requiring to be further trained. When we try to support someone, but we also require them to go through further training to provide peer support, again it adds to the load on their bandwidth and stress.",2,46,014-001-095-042-001-046,46

To the extent that we can, we would want to do this as part of their professional training. Having said that, one of the things about counselling services is this  be it students or teachers, they all need someone that they can trust in order for them to open up to the counsellors or to the peer, to share. Without this trusting relationship, it is not a function of how many counsellors that we have. Even if we have the counsellors, be they para-counsellors or full-time counsellors, we need this trust relationship to be established. Which is why from Secondary schools and above, we try as much as possible for the first layer to have the peer support, for each of them to be able to identify their own issues and also to look out for their peers. And then, we escalate it to either the family or the teachers, and we escalate it next level to the full-time counsellors. So, we need to triage this.",2,51,014-001-095-042-001-051,51

Definitely, we want to promote a safe environment for people to come forward and seek help.

We tend to look at mental health as a black or white issue  I am mentally okay, or I am mentally not okay. We may need to update our concept. Let us look at it as a kind of fitness level. We all grow in our fitness level, with a bit of training. Today, I might not be able to run as fast or as far. But with a bit of training, tomorrow I can run further and faster. And mental health is also like that. Today, I might not be able to cope with some things.

In spite of that, once we have achieved that high level of vaccination, and we also had enough evidence to show that those of us who have received and completed the two doses of the vaccination, the incidence of complications was significantly less than for those who are unvaccinated.

In Justin’s case, he was trafficking drugs and seems like he was also abusing drugs. But with the right help, he could also have changed. And our processes are structured to provide that guidance and help, after he is dealt with in Court. We bring in the family into these efforts as well because, without adequate family support, it is difficult to help the young person.",2,20,014-001-095-042-006-020,148

There are regular reviews to ensure that they are up to date. Ms Denise Phua, in 2016, and Ms Sylvia Lim, in 2017, had asked if all persons under 18 can be supported with an Appropriate Adult during interviews. Given that the AAYS scheme applies to all persons under 16, the point really is whether it can be extended to persons who are 16 and 17. We have told both of them that this would be reviewed. There were some difficulties in expanding the scheme to suspects in this age group. So, we decided to operationalise the current process, which was announced in 2017, for a period first, while we consider if, and, if so, how we can deal with the issues.

Justin’s case falls in the small minority of 16%, because he was openly trafficking. The general approach when dealing with young suspects is to, where possible, avoid criminalising their conduct, give them a second chance and help them in their rehabilitation. Suitable youths who have been arrested for minor offences can be referred to diversionary programmes, such as the Guidance Programme introduced in 1997, which has a strong focus on counselling and rehabilitation. Placing youth offenders on diversionary programmes allows them to be accountable for their actions and prevents disruption in other areas of development, such as education.

MDWs who already possess documentation overseas can be on boarded onto the programme within a week and there are slots available. AEAS and its partner employment agencies will adjust the programme according to demand to compliment the entry of MDWs through the mainstream channel.

I thank the Minister of State for the comprehensive reply. We are very thankful that MOM is able to increase the quota for MDWs.

On the number of MDWs who are waiting to enter Singapore for the next three months, there are several thousands. But I think the more important point is how we are able to gradually increase the entry of MDWs while protecting public health in Singapore.

For Myanmar and India, we also know flights were affected by the Not-to-land (NTL) that was determined by MTF. This NTL has been lifted recently. So, we are also hopeful that employers will be able to bring in the MDWs from Myanmar and India for the next few months. Again, the AEAS option already extends to Myanmar and, soon, to India as well.

Raising the retirement age is essential for Singapore because it benefits our workers for this new economy.

Hence, the solution might be to employ a mixture of vigorous young workers and more experienced older workers.

Digital tools should not be seen as the new takeover in making our economy an efficient one, but these tools are to assist our workers who are equipped with upgraded skills to effectively harness these tools.

This is especially important for housewives who are relying on their husband's CPF LIFE payouts, as women tend to outlive their husbands. The Panel had proposed then that members be allowed to transfer their CPF savings above what they require for Basic Retirement Sum to their spouses' Special or Retirement Accounts.

It is, as I have mentioned earlier, to simplify and make easier to facilitate the beneficiaries’ claim through the distribution of un-nominated CPF monies via the BR; and also to facilitate the beneficiaries, the speed at which it can be done, while at the same time managing and mitigating the risk of disagreement or conflict which might arise between the beneficiaries.",6,86,014-001-095-042-008-086,298

Besides the PTO’s actions taken to safeguard the rights and interests of the beneficiaries, the framework is in-built with a safeguard to only apply to cases where the deceased member’s un-nominated sums do not exceed this sum. This specified limit, in our view, strikes a balance between expediency in the disbursement of the funds and safeguarding of the beneficiaries’ rights and interests, particularly in the context of larger estates. A specified limit of $10,000 would allow around half of the current number of cases coming forward to make a claim for un-nominated sums and we believe that, of this half, a substantial number will be uncontentious and will benefit from an expedited scheme like this.",24,104,014-001-095-042-008-104,316

The BR need not submit proof of eligibility of all the other eligible beneficiaries, so this cuts down part of the administrative time and effort. The BR approach relieves the other beneficiaries from administrative inconvenience.

In this regard, I agree with Mr Heng Chee How, who has very wisely pointed out that strengthening the employability of our senior workers cannot start only when they are near retirement age. There is a need to invest in retraining and employment facilitation not only for our senior workers, but also for the future cohorts of senior workers. As Mr Patrick Tay has highlighted, employers play an instrumental role in this. And we are committed to providing the necessary assistance, including funding support.

So, today, I will just highlight the critical roles that our tripartite partners NTUC and SNEF play in this endeavour. The Company Training Committees, or CTCs, established by NTUC early this year, are making their impact felt. The CTCs bring together the employers, HR and employee representatives to identify gaps and opportunities and develop the necessary training plans to align a company’s workforce to its business transformation roadmap. This ensures that our senior workers’ training needs are correctly identified, to enable them to contribute productively for many more years to come.",26,27,014-001-095-042-010-027,368

This allows training needs and suitable job roles to be identified early. Employees will also be more motivated to pick up new skills if they have a clearer picture of how they fit into their companies’ future plans.

As mentioned by Mr Shawn Huang and Ms Yeo Wan Ling, it is also important for our workers to adopt a lifelong learning mindset.

The Payout Eligibility Age, or PEA, is not linked to the retirement or re-employment age. The current PEA of 65 strikes a balance between timely access to retirement income and providing a sufficient runway for members to build up savings for retirement, especially as Singaporeans are expected to live longer. Members continue to have the option to defer the payouts for higher monthly payouts. In fact, yesterday, I shared that for every year that they defer after 65, the increase could be up to 7% more per annum.",33,34,014-001-095-042-010-034,375

2021-11-02,Retirement and Re-employment (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-042-010,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Earlier, he mentioned that the consensus among the tripartite partners was that this was still necessary on the statute books as it serves as a floor to protect workers. My question is that most, if not all, employment contracts, as I have mentioned in my speech, do have a termination clause where either the employer or the employee can give notice of a short period, one to two months, to stop the employment relationship and no reasons need to be given. And if notice is not sufficient, payment in lieu can be made in accordance with that clause.",2,58,014-001-095-042-010-058,399

Firstly, as I have said in my speech, I am not here to encourage people to work to their last breath. Has MOM done a study on how many of those actually choose to retire early, maybe because of age or they just want to retire early? Hence, can they actually ask for their CPF payouts to be at an earlier age compared to 65? That was the main gist of me requesting for the Ministry to explore the possibility if someone decides to retire before the legislative age because they want to do something personal. To them, it is their money and they are also requesting whether they can get part of the share.",2,65,014-001-095-042-010-065,406

At 55, the member can withdraw a guaranteed sum of $ 5,000, provided he has the money in his CPF account. In the Retirement Account, he is expected to have the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS), which I believe is pegged at $93,000 today. If his property is pledged – and I believe the majority of Singaporeans today would have a property and it is pledged to the CPF – he can withdraw not just the $5,000 at the age of 55, he can also withdraw a sum higher than the $5,000 from his Special Account and his Ordinary Account.

How will the evolution of technology in energy infrastructure affect us and, if needed, how much would it cost in terms of actual infrastructure and human capital requirements and where would these increased landing points be located as it comes in into Singapore? And with the need to invest in capital for the cables and the landing stations, how much more would these add to the cost for consumers, whether it is private or public built? What can our Government do to mitigate the higher cost going forward, maybe a few decades down the road?",7,189,014-001-095-042-012-189,612

In recent times, we have seen how the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted operations in some countries. So, we need to think of contingencies so that we are not caught off-guard.",8,190,014-001-095-042-012-190,613

The resultant effect caused spot electricity futures on SGX to spike on those days. This also prompted the operator of the LNG terminal, Singapore LNG Corp, to look into boosting gas inventory to bolster energy supplies. We need to learn from this and look at how to manage such a scenario.",9,191,014-001-095-042-012-191,614

How do we ensure, if one supply source is disrupted, the other external sources could still keep the supply flowing? I think some Members in the House mentioned this earlier, but it highlights the point that, besides diversity, we need to ensure that our external source supplies actually do not get disrupted significantly, even after diversification. For example, the natural gas supply to Singapore from Indonesia was disrupted in July and, as of October, the supply has not fully recovered. The July disruptions were blamed mainly on an unplanned shutdown at the Anoa field and planned maintenance at the Gajah Baru field, both located in Natuna, according to a report. Production in Natuna is down 27.5% from its previous peak to 370 million standard cubic feet per day.",10,192,014-001-095-042-012-192,615

""The recent spike could be attributed to a number of factors, including higher than usual electricity demand, the outage of several generation units, curtailments of gas from West Natuna, as well as low landing pressure of the gas supplied from South Sumatra,"" EMA reportedly said.",11,193,014-001-095-042-012-193,616

""Gas exports to Singapore will stop in 2023 and we will use the gas for the domestic market”, Downstream Oil and Gas Regulatory Agency (BPH Migas) head Fanshurullah Asa said, as quoted from the ministry’s press release. Indonesia's gas exports to Singapore come from the Corridor Block, which has a supply of 300 million standard cubic feet per day. The gas supply will be channelled into the Dumai Duri transmission pipeline to be distributed to industrial estates in Sumatra, namely, the Sei Mangkei Special Economic Zone in North Sumatra, among other destinations.",12,194,014-001-095-042-012-194,617

This is where new offshore terminals will also add Singapore to a growing list of Asian countries deploying floating infrastructure. Can the Minister give the House an update on this undertaking and how are we coping with these LNG alternatives? When would LNG likely replace our demand for natural gas for use by gencos? And what steps are in place to avoid a worst-case scenario? Would it result in any supply shortage that may necessitate a back-out of supply to households?",14,196,014-001-095-042-012-196,619

Clause 2(a) of the Bill expands the powers of EMA. With this change, EMA can now raise loans and grant charges over EMA’s property. I understand that the goal is to ensure energy security by freeing EMA to fund its construction of critical energy infrastructure. However, it seems like this change also opens a gap in our energy security. After all, borrowing from foreign financiers may also mean granting them rights and interests over parts of our energy infrastructure. Can the Minister share in what circumstances would such foreign funding be approved by the Government?

In its response to feedback from the public consultation, MTI said that EMA would use its new powers under this law to develop “further targeted measures” that would reduce the power generation sector’s emissions. Can the Minister share EMA’s timeline for consulting the sector and for releasing new standards and policies? Put simply, we are already behind schedule. The latest IPCC report on climate change stresses that there is only a small window of opportunity left for countries to keep the 2050 temperature increase below two degree Celsius.

Hong Kong’s Antiquities and Monuments Ordinance, section 5, also provides for public officials to have such powers of entry to inspect monuments. For entry into residential sites, written consent must be obtained from the occupier, or the Authority must give not less than 48 hours' written notice of their intention to enter. Furthermore, section 22(2)(b) of this Ordinance reads, quote, “no regulations made under this Ordinance shall confer upon a person any right which he would not otherwise have had to enter upon private land"", unquote.

Section 2C of the Ordinance provides that if the proposed monument is within private land, the owner or occupier may at any time apply to the Authority for withdrawal of the declaration.

One of our national monuments that had been gazetted early on in 1980 is Lian Shan Shuang Lin Monastery. In the 1990s, it fell into disrepair and was infested by termites. But the restoration and reconstruction took almost 20 years due to the difficulties in, firstly, finding local craftsmen with the necessary expertise and, secondly, bringing in foreign craftsmen.",33,87,014-001-095-042-013-087,825
2021-11-02,Preservation of Monuments (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-042-013,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Singapore currently classifies heritage building maintenance and restoration under the construction industry, so, these craftsmen can only work here as foreign construction workers. However, the highly-skilled and experienced craftsmen preferred for these projects are often older and would face the age limit obstacle when applying for a work permit. Furthermore, they would only be allowed to work on a single “construction” project, and would have to leave on project completion. So, there is no one available to attend to the daily maintenance of these heritage buildings. I also note that, in recent years, it has been even harder to attract such foreign craftsmen to come here, given that the pay in Singapore may not be significantly more attractive than in their home country. Could the Ministry look into this problem more closely in collaboration with MOM and perhaps consider relaxing entry requirements for foreign craftsmen by recognising them as such, instead of seeing them as “foreign construction workers”; and allowing them to work on multiple projects while here?",34,88,014-001-095-042-013-088,826

In MCCY’s press release on this Bill, the Padang had been singled out as a site that will be proposed for preservation. Despite having borne witness to key historical milestones, the Padang today is regrettably an under-utilised public place. When there are no major events held there, it is deserted and almost ""lifeless"". Beyond simply preserving the site, could our urban planners and architects be challenged to imagine new ways of bringing the space to life, so future generations can be a part of its story?",42,96,014-001-095-042-013-096,834

Section 20(1)(a) deals with non-compliance of an enforcement notice.

So, again, every attempt is made to demonstrate that you are either unable to enter, or you have been refused entry, and these two sub-provisions that I have cited show that every effort must be made by the officer concerned to make an attempt to either speak to the owner or occupier or some other person who appears to have control of the site – and all that takes place before entering, as is explicit in both sections 27(2B)(a) and (b).",19,146,014-001-095-042-013-146,884

Further, any person duly authorised by the Secretary of State may at any reasonable time enter any land for any of the following purposes that include surveying, ascertaining whether an order has been complied with, ascertaining whether an offence has been or is being committed and ascertaining whether any building or any land or any other land on site is being maintained properly, or whether it is in a proper state of repair.",24,151,014-001-095-042-013-151,889

Indeed, preservation and enforcement powers help us to safeguard National Monuments, but that, in itself, is not sufficient if the public is not aware of its significance and also appreciative of its heritage value. Many of us would have noticed that several of our National Monuments have also been given a new lease of life, to borrow Mr Leon Perera's words, ""through careful, adaptive reuse"", which is a pragmatic and sustainable approach to preservation. Even though their historic façades and structures are preserved, the internal uses may evolve over time.

2021-11-02,Preservation of Monuments (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-042-013,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"For now, it is probably best for us to look at the sites and, given the level of interactivity that NHB has with stakeholders, with owners, with occupiers, with members of the public, with the heritage groups, it is sufficient for now, I believe, to leave it as ""reasonable period"", so that there is some flexibility in their engagement. And one can also have regard to the specific context of the site in question. And it does not have to be tied to a particular period, in all cases, for all sites or all buildings.",42,169,014-001-095-042-013-169,907

In fact, NHB engages the heritage societies I have mentioned regularly, including NGOs, docent leaders, monument owners and occupiers regularly. And also the grant applicants, those who take grants from NHB, we engage them as our stakeholders. NHB also conducts focus group discussions and public consultations for major projects and initiatives. Our SG Heritage plan is part of that.

Mr Leon Perera asked if it is online and if it is free. I think if it is online it will be free and NHB intends to publish it online, so that members of the public will know in advance if something is proposed to be gazetted as a monument.

As I have explained in my opening speech, sometimes, for a site, besides being subject to regulations or orders on preservation, how it is to be conserved, preserved and so on, there is also a question of how it is otherwise maintained by other agencies. In some cases, it may be a sewer, in other cases it may be about the maintenance of the environment. What section 22A does is to provide that these other agencies may come in and deal with their area of operations, their works, without running afoul of PMA.

So, I did tell her that she could try to suggest to some of our local supermarkets to bring in the product.

Today, travellers are granted GST import relief on new goods that are purchased overseas and brought into Singapore for their personal use, with the relief amount set at $500 with 48 hours spent away from Singapore.

High inflation would simply mean lower real incomes and, at the moment, the debate globally, which has yet to be settled, is whether or not the current inflationary pressures in the market are seen to be transitory or permanent.

Yes, I acknowledge that there will be an enhancement to the permanent GST Voucher scheme, which, at the moment, only applies to those earning less than $2,300 a month, amongst other conditions. These may be progressive elements involved but does the raising of GST make our tax system as a whole more progressive or more regressive? I believe the answer is clear.

The same survey also found that more than half of the respondents shopped less frequently in physical stores.

They keep their prices affordable not just to drive up profit margins, but because they thrive on strong personal relationships with the very people they serve.

2021-11-02,Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-042-016,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My second point is on the use of best available information to determine whether goods are distantly taxable.

Can the Minister elaborate where the burden of proof lies and how the burden shifts in determining whether there was compliance with the tax treatment of distantly taxable goods? For instance, does the burden of proof shift to the Comptroller of Income Tax once the recipient is able to show a preliminary case that they relied on the best available information? Is the burden of proof then on the Comptroller to show that the recipient, in fact, had access to and should have relied on other information?",12,38,014-001-095-042-016-038,1033

2021-11-02,Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-042-016,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"First, Mdm Deputy Speaker, we need to provide more support for lower-income households. I am concerned that imposing GST on all incoming overseas goods will lead to an increased burden on these residents. Has the Government done research or sought feedback on how foreign online retailers intend to handle this tax increase? Will it be absorbed? If not, how much of it will be passed on to the consumers? As this new Bill mainly impacts individual buyers, the additional tax will be a heavier burden for our lower- to middle-income families.

According to a survey, eight in 10 local respondents shared that the main reason was the overall lower cost of procuring goods and services from foreign sites. The second reason was the wider variety of international brands’ products and the lack of availability from local retailers. If Singaporeans cannot find their preferred brand, services or shopping experience locally, the imposition of the GST will do little to shift their buying behaviour towards local businesses.",5,44,014-001-095-042-016-044,1039
2021-11-02,Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-042-016,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"As such, local businesses must not be lulled into a false sense of security, thinking that they can rest on their laurels and become complacent with the perceived decreased competition from foreign markets. They must continue to innovate, use business analytics to understand their customers’ needs, establish global partnerships and bring in products that are in high demand. The Government must continue to encourage and support our local businesses to compete globally by embarking on digitalisation and by getting onto these online retail platforms. In this connection, perhaps the additional tax revenue from the imposition of GST can be funnelled to support the globalisation efforts of local businesses.",6,45,014-001-095-042-016-045,1040

As such, the Government may require disproportionately more resources to ensure that individuals comply with the new GST regulations. How will the Government ensure that there are adequate resources to enforce the new policies in an efficient manner? Will more personnel be hired to handle the additional workload at IRAS?

Is IRAS ready for the potential increase in enforcement action when this comes into play? As for businesses, local GST is imposed on all GST-registered companies in Singapore. They collect GST from the customers or absorb it. And the collective amount is paid to the Government. Will foreign retailers who wish to sell to the Singapore market be GST-registered?

How will the Government deal with overseas companies who fail to comply with our GST regulations? In the case of New Zealand, their Inland Revenue would monitor for non-complying retailers.

And will they be told that they have to pay additional GST to collect their parcel in Singapore? SingPost has recently switched to an online cashless system for collecting GST on packages valued above $400. The new policy would see a significant rise in the number of packages due for GST payment. This could also provide opportunities for scams. Unscrupulous merchants may leverage on this to cheat consumers into paying them a sum to retrieve their purchase. Parcel clearance scams, where callers masquerade as customs officers asking for payment to retrieve a parcel, have not been uncommon even before this. It is thus imperative to educate consumers on when and where GST is to be paid and the official payment platforms to do so.

Our revenue is not coming from taxes alone. And the budgetary surpluses of the entire last two decades have been called upon because of COVID-19.

Tourism is down now, but when you look at the mid- and longer-term projections, that 60% still remains the same. So, our GST system is a good example of how we do this redistribution and never forget that this Government will do what is necessary to support our people. When you consider the pandemic, we had five Budgets. Every time the MTF had to put in place measures that affect businesses, we put in place support. So, you cannot look at just one single item and say, ""Oh, this, by itself, please change, it is very onerous"". You do have to look at the bigger picture.

I am sure Members of this House would have received many requests by your residents to assist them with an appeal for a rental flat from the HDB, just as I have. Again, in response to my PQ in April this year, Minister Desmond Lee shared that, from 2016 to 2020, HDB received an average of 7,500 requests regarding rental flats and only about 35% or an average of 2,600 such requests were successful each year.",14,16,014-001-095-042-018-016,1145

Also, the average waiting time for BTO projects has increased, from an average of three to four years in the past to four to five years for ongoing BTO projects.

Single buyers have access to housing grants and can buy smaller BTO units in non-mature estates. While our overall housing policy continues to support families, we recognise the home ownership aspirations that many singles have. For instance, some singles have had to forgo opportunities of forming families of their own because of caregiver responsibilities. Seniors who are single also tend to be more vulnerable than those who can count on the support of their spouses, children and even grandchildren. In such cases, home ownership can be material in improving a person's well-being as well as financial security.

Fifty years on, while the security context has changed, the remit of the FPDA has remained the same, that is, for member-nations to consult one another in the event of a threat or actual armed aggression against Malaysia or Singapore.

In recent years, these activities have incorporated contemporary security threats, such as terrorism. Exercise Bersama Gold this year is the highlight exercise for the FPDA’s 50th Anniversary. The fact that, despite the pandemic, member-nations successfully held an exercise with around 2,700 troops, many ships and planes and a submarine, and pulled together a flypast and naval display over the Marina Bay area in Singapore reflects the strong, continued commitment of the five countries to the FPDA.

Employers will not receive JSS payouts if they fail to make CPF contributions for their employees for the respective reference month. Similarly, if employers cut wages for their employees during the respective reference month, their JSS payout will be correspondingly reduced. In other words, the JSS is designed as a reimbursement to help employers offset part of the wages already paid to their employees.

For cases with high risk of fraud, such as irregular CPF contributions to get higher JSS payouts, IRAS requires the firms to authenticate their CPF contributions before the payouts are released. As of August 2021, 1,889 cases have been denied or had their JSS payout adjusted.

While the Government does not intervene in how business owners and board directors determine remuneration and bonuses for key executives, they are expected to practise good corporate governance and stewardship. In particular, a good practice is to exclude Government grants in the computation of a company’s financial performance for the purposes of determining remuneration and bonuses for key executives. This is because Government grants are not a result of the performance efforts of these key executives.

This arose from previous AGO audit observations. Given the long-term nature of season parking, season parking rates are not waived or refunded due to partial use. This applies to all Government-managed car parks, even if the season parking holder does not physically come into the office on certain days due to work from home or hybrid work arrangements. Hence, the parking rates are worked out on the basis of a flat monthly charge, with no pro-rating or waiver for days when there are days of non-usage. This also means that the monthly season rates typically translate to a fairly reasonable pricing, which is certainly the case for school season parking, as compared to alternative time-based parking options at nearby public carparks.",3,4,014-001-095-042-040-004,1349

The minimum occupation period, or MOP, for new and resale HDB flats ensures that flat buyers purchase HDB flats with the intent of living in the flat, instead of quickly reselling the flats for profit.

This year’s supply is already higher than the 14,600 and 16,800 flats launched in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Given the current strong housing demand, we will continue on this trajectory going forward to ensure that housing supply keeps up with demand.

We have been actively collaborating with foreign law enforcement agencies to share information that may lead to the arrest of scammers based abroad.

For example, in 2018, a study by Elizabeth Keogh, Bruce Smythe and Alexander Masardo found that in Australia, which legislated default ""shared parenting time"" since 2006, shared-time arrangements may work well for children where separated parents are able to cooperate and communicate in ways that avoid or contain conflict. This increases the longevity and quality of the relationship between the child and both parents, encouraging parents to maintain or establish a meaningful relationship in all aspects of the child’s life1.",2,3,014-001-095-042-051-003,1389

Where there are high levels of ongoing conflict, shared-time arrangements may be more damaging because children are likely to be “caught and used” in conflicts. Where there are safety concerns arising from issues, such as family violence, mental health, alcohol or substance abuse, child well-being could also be negatively affected in a shared-time arrangement.",3,4,014-001-095-042-051-004,1390

An earlier study by the Australian Institute of Family Studies in 2009 showed that children in shared-time arrangements fared slightly better than those who were mainly in the care of one parent and spent some time with the non-resident parent on some measures, but the differences were small and largely disappeared after controlling for demographics and other characteristics3.",4,5,014-001-095-042-051-005,1391

Cooperative co-parenting is characterised by parents who communicate frequently and collaborate with each other regarding their children’s matters and make major decisions about their children together. Parallel co-parenting is characterised by parents who tend not to communicate with each other and seldom make major decisions about their children together, but both continue to be involved in their children’s lives.",5,6,014-001-095-042-051-006,1392

We take these offences seriously. However, the question is whether they will qualify under the OCA – do they pose a serious threat to public safety and security in Singapore and are they related to organised crime? Over the years, NParks has investigated and made a number of prosecutions for illegal wildlife trade. These cases have so far not been found to be associated with organised crime in Singapore. That said, MHA and MND will monitor the developments. We do not rule out including these offences under OCA if the specific criteria set out are met. We will emphasise  even if they are not within the ambit of the OCA, nevertheless, they are considered serious offences.",2,3,014-001-095-042-054-003,1407

This includes wearing a helmet and riding as near as practicable to the far-left edge of the road except when overtaking. These rules apply for all roads, including bus lanes. Between January 2018 and September 2021, 545 helmet-related offences were detected. The number of violations detected by the Traffic Police (TP) of cyclists riding on the right side of a motor vehicle, whether in a bus lane or otherwise, when not overtaking or preparing to make a right turn and for not riding at the far-left edge of the road was eight, 12, three and two for 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 respectively, and two for the first nine months of this year.",1,3,014-001-095-042-067-003,1465

The scheme helps companies defray the cost of conducting independent assessments to validate the sustainability credentials of a loan. The GSLS also supports banks in the development of green and sustainability-linked loan frameworks. Such frameworks provide standardised criteria and processes for the assessment and issuance of loans to finance activities that contribute to sustainable development, such as the construction of green buildings.",3,4,014-001-095-042-093-004,1563

2021-11-02,Legislation for Existing TAFEP Guidelines,014-001-095-042-097,Dr Tan See Leng,  The Tripartite Committee on Workplace Fairness’ deliberations involve defining the scope of future legislation and designing a legal framework that is balanced and in the best interest of Singapore and Singaporeans. This includes a claims process where mediation is the first and necessary step and appearance before the tribunal is a last resort to avoid the unintended consequence of fostering a litigious workplace culture. This has worked well for the handling of salary-related and wrongful dismissal cases.,1,2,014-001-095-042-097-002,1577
2021-11-02,Legislation for Existing TAFEP Guidelines,014-001-095-042-097,Dr Tan See Leng,"We agree with the Member that anxieties about workplace discrimination can also be driven by perceptions. Not every complaint means that the employer has done something wrong. That is why the mediation process, in itself, is an opportunity for employers and employees to close gaps in their understanding of requirements. Legislation must also go hand in hand with education efforts to change mindsets and attitudes towards inclusive and fair work practices.",2,3,014-001-095-042-097-003,1578
2021-11-02,Legislation for Existing TAFEP Guidelines,014-001-095-042-097,Dr Tan See Leng,"The reality is that trade-offs will need to be made as we develop an approach that aims to strike a balance between objectives that are in tension with each other. For example, while we want to ensure that claims are thoroughly investigated, which is time-consuming, we also want to make sure that the claims management process is efficient and not over-burdensome on workers and employers. This illustrates the difficult task being undertaken by the Tripartite Committee, which will have to manage such trade-offs.",3,4,014-001-095-042-097-004,1579
