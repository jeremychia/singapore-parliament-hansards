While responding to the incident, the SCDF officers found the fire engine accessway leading to Block 91 Henderson Road obstructed by a tent where a funeral wake was being held.

The Police are currently conducting an independent, thorough investigation into the circumstances of SGT1 Edward's demise and will apprise the Coroner of its findings.

They also use proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and equipment that are common to their fire station. From their time in the CDA, their instructors will closely monitor them and look at their progress and help build their confidence. The relationship, the camaraderie and peer support are also vital parts of the culture and overall journey. In fact, I visit SCDF fire stations as well as some of the set-ups regularly, and this is something I have noticed. The peer support, the relationship and that journey that someone goes through – whether for NSFs or Regulars – is so important. The juniors will look up to the seniors, not only between the Regulars and the NSFs, but also between the NSFs together, they look up to their seniors and they want to see how they can play their part.",2,21,014-001-095-079-003-021,30

They will not straightaway go to the frontline, as in fight the fire. This is the opportunity to give them the time to settle down and get to know their Rota. During this time, their supervisors will observe the NSFs in the daily shifts, watch them perform during drills and training to assess their suitability, competency and confidence to be placed on turn-out, on the main fire engines and Red Rhinos. This is where they are most likely to be on-scene, earlier than the rest.",3,22,014-001-095-079-003-022,31

2023-01-09,Review of SCDF Training in wake of Recent Passing of NSF Firefighter,014-001-095-079-003,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Indeed, just like many of the vocations which require practical experience, the only way for all firefighting personnel – whether Regular or NSF – to build their experience is on-the-job training.

Like what the Member shared earlier, we feel the loss of the late SGT Edward. Just like the rest, all NSFs need to be certified medically fit and complete the relevant training and courses, prior to deployment at the frontline. During his training as a firefighter, SGT1 Edward Go attained ""Gold"" standard for his individual Physical Proficiency Test and faired well in the other mandatory course requirements, including achieving an ""A"" grading for his Breathing Apparatus Proficiency Test. His performance, in fact, was among the top 25% in his cohort. Like the rest, he would go through the journey like any other SCDF NSF. In fact, when he was posted to the Central Fire Station in May 2022, he had attended nearly 60 fire and rescue calls. So, he was an officer with some level of experience as well.",7,26,014-001-095-079-003-026,35

Sir, I have one supplementary question for the Minister of State. I note that there have been quite a number of fires in public rental blocks in recent years.

Not only rental flats, all HDB buildings are compliant with the prevailing Fire Code at the time when they were built or renovated. At the unit level, flats are designed as separate fire compartments to minimise the risk of fire spread to other units via walls of required fire-resistance rating. So that is at the unit level. And fire-rated doors will also have a closer, to ensure that they do not stay open after the occupants have evacuated.",1,29,014-001-095-079-003-029,38
2023-01-09,Review of SCDF Training in wake of Recent Passing of NSF Firefighter,014-001-095-079-003,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"This maintains the route of evacuation for residents for a certain time, based on the fire rating. For the common areas of Block 91 Henderson Road, the corridor width complies with the prevailing Fire-Code requirements. On a day-to-day basis, Town Council conduct fire safety inspections of the HDB blocks, such as checking on obstruction along corridors and requiring residents to remove them. So, the involved Block 91 Henderson Road also complies with the prevailing Fire Code requirements, that the fire engine access road must be within 18 metres of the dry riser breaching inlets located near the exit staircases",2,30,014-001-095-079-003-030,39

I have one supplementary question for the Minister of State. Earlier, he mentioned that the coroner would study the outcome of the Police investigations into the incident. I would like to ask him whether there has been any decision or indication that a coroner's inquiry will be held in open Court in this case, because, obviously, there is a high element of public interest and it would be good for the public to follow the circumstances of what happened to the deceased.",1,34,014-001-095-079-003-034,43

This scheme is designed to work in tandem with the various Government programmes that support Singapore's economic priorities. Firms that participate in these programmes contribute towards Singapore's competitiveness and generate economic opportunities for Singaporeans. M-SEP provides these firms with time-bound manpower flexibilities, should these firms require it.

Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Mr Patrick Tay have asked how the Ministry will safeguard against abuse of these work passes and ascertain that foreign workers hired under the M-SEP scheme will be deployed in areas that advance Singapore's economic goals. This is inherent in the design of Condition 1. The 16 programmes or activities under Condition 1 are specially selected to be in line with our economic priorities. In this way, M-SEP is selective in targeting firms or investments that will grow our economy and also grow our competitiveness. To take part in these programmes, these firms would have worked closely with our economic agencies, like EDB or ESG. Only about 1,000 firms will meet the qualifying criteria. This represents less than 1% of all registered business entities in Singapore.",7,17,014-001-095-079-004-017,62

This is the archetype of firms which the M-SEP scheme is targeted at.

I hope that, as a result of the explanation, he can see and appreciate how M-SEP is about helping firms to create more opportunities for Singapore. In fact, some of the Condition 1 programmes are related not just to growth, but also to help firms to become more productive at the same time, through innovation and internationalisation. To reduce the reliance on large numbers of low- and mid-skilled foreign workers, and continue in their automation journeys, firms will need to pivot and transform. And this is what Condition 1 is fundamentally about – to support our strategic economic priorities. To further assure the Member, M-SEP only provides time-limited support. So even if a company uses additional foreign workers to transform initially, these flexibilities are time-limited and they will cease after the support period.",16,26,014-001-095-079-004-026,71

In the process of rolling out COMPASS, the ONE Pass and now the M-SEP scheme, which we committed to in the last Committee of Supply (COS), we have ensured that the COMPASS scheme has been appropriately resourced, the departments are there to conduct the relevant checks including sieving out potential cases of false salary declarations, where such declarations are needed.

One, in terms of our innovation, as a research and development hub. Second, investments into ensuring that we continue to become and maintain our status as a hub, not just in the region but globally. And the third thing is, how do we help these companies internationalise. These are very clear strategic economic priorities where we can ascertain clearly what the outcomes will be.

2023-01-09,Work Passes Issued under Manpower for Strategic Economic Priorities Scheme,014-001-095-079-004,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"  Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. The first supplementary question to the hon Minister is, is the Government still planning to cap the ratio of foreign workers at one-third of the overall workforce and does the introduction of M-SEP put us at risk of breaching that cap? The reason I ask this is because I think this cap of one-third of the workforce, which was alluded to in the Economic Strategies Report of 2010 and is something that has been affirmed at various points for quite some time; and most recently, by Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong in this House, I think last year.",1,62,014-001-095-079-004-062,107

2023-01-09,Work Passes Issued under Manpower for Strategic Economic Priorities Scheme,014-001-095-079-004,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"And lastly, I think, when introducing M-SEP, the Government has previously taken the view that there will be no U-turns and this was made very clear to the business sector. So, does the introduction of M-SEP, which is giving companies extra foreign worker quota, amount to a U-turn in the Government's foreign manpower policies? Or how will the Government manage the risk that it will be seen by the business sector as a U-turn or as a sign that possibly in the future, the Government will U-turn and make some concessions on the foreign manpower policy, and therefore lessen the drive to increase productivity and strengthen the Singapore Core, which is the acknowledged policy aim of the Government?",3,64,014-001-095-079-004-064,109

The few relevant M-SEP firms that I had chatted with are appreciative of this new scheme.

Today, by extension, if you want to extend the M-SEP support scheme to audit firms, I think would really be too broad-based and it may run counter to M-SEP, which is intended to be very highly selective.

Owners are required to physically occupy their flat during the Minimum Occupation Period (MOP), before they are allowed to sell their flat on the open market or rent out the whole flat. During the MOP, owners are not allowed to leave the flat vacant, or rent out the whole flat without staying in it – this also means that owners are not allowed to rent out their whole flat under the guise of renting out only the bedrooms, for instance, by locking up one room and not actually living in it. To be clear, this also applies to Executive Condominiums, or ECs.",2,13,014-001-095-079-005-013,156

It also helps, in part, to deter the speculative purchase of HDB flats to keep HDB flats affordable. Nevertheless, we recognised that flat owners' circumstances may change over time. Some may aspire to own a bigger flat or private residential property as their financial situation improves or as their family size grow. While others may wish to right-size or to move closer to their parents or children for mutual care and support. In short, life stages change. The current five-year MOP seeks to strike a balance  on the one hand reinforcing the objective of owner occupation, while on the other hand not unduly hampering those who want to move when their family circumstances or life needs change.",4,15,014-001-095-079-005-015,158

Other participants suggested carving out popular BTO projects, such as those in well sought-after locations or in areas with very favourable attributes, such as close proximity to amenities and imposing tighter HDB ownership conditions – such as longer MOP – to further deter speculative intent. And yet, there are other participants who suggested tiered MOPs – for applicants at the same income level, those who accept longer MOPs can get more subsidies and those with shorter MOPs get much lesser subsidy and pay for BTO flats closer to market price.",7,18,014-001-095-079-005-018,161

The CAP will continue to review all feedback received and will engage businesses, where necessary, to address the issue. The CAP is prepared to publicly highlight egregious businesses which persist in GST misrepresentation.",1,2,014-001-095-079-006-002,199

Businesses are encouraged to be transparent in their communication on price adjustments. The Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) publishes best practices on price display and communication. The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) has recently issued an advisory for businesses which need to adjust their prices, on how they should communicate their reasons for price or fee adjustments to consumers. Our trade association partners have also been guiding their members in clearly communicating any price adjustments. For instance, the Federation of Merchants' Associations Singapore (FMAS) and the Heartland Enterprise Centre Singapore (HECS) have conducted extensive outreach and walkabouts in coffee shops, in HDB shops and hawker centres to remind their members of the need to be transparent about their pricing.",2,3,014-001-095-079-006-003,200

I will respond in two ways. One, I want to say that MTI monitors the prices of essential products and services via one of our agencies called the Department of Statistics (DOS). We keep a very close watch on the prices of essential goods through the Consumer Price Index (CPI). We review, we share the CPI survey regularly. The CPI is compiled by DOS and measures the average price changes of a fixed basket of consumption goods and services commonly purchased by resident households over time.",1,7,014-001-095-079-006-007,204

MTI and the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) have been working very closely with CASE, in particular, since a few years ago and especially in the last one year, to further strengthen Price Kaki. I am happy to share with Ms Foo and Members of the House that today, consumers can use the Price Kaki app, developed by CASE, to compare prices of more than 10,000 supermarket items and more than 37,000 cooked food items from food courts, hawker centres and coffee shops. At the touch of a button, you will be able to see the items within your vicinity and you have choices. This is really what we want  free market competition and for consumers and fellow Singaporeans to have a wide range of choices.

It is not just the item itself. It is also unit prices. This feature came about because we hear a lot of feedback from fellow Singaporeans about the need to understand the price changes for a unit of a product.

2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"First, given the heightened risk profile of international travellers, would Singapore consider temporarily tightening the mask-wearing policy to require masks to be worn on board all flights entering Singapore so that we can reduce the risk of inflight COVID-19 contamination? I think we all believe that masks act as the first line of defence against the spread of the virus.",2,34,014-001-095-079-009-034,347
2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Second, as Minister Ong mentioned earlier, COVID-19 wastewater surveillance has shown to be a valuable tool. Airplane wastewater surveillance could potentially be an option. Would Singapore consider stepping up sampling wastewater taken from international aircraft entering Singapore to track any emerging new variants?",3,35,014-001-095-079-009-035,348
2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr S Iswaran,"  I would leave the wastewater question to the Minister for Health, who can speak on it more authoritatively.",1,36,014-001-095-079-009-036,349
2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr S Iswaran,"On the point on mask wearing, today, specifically with respect to China, the airlines already require mask-wearing for their crew as a precautionary measure. Also, China already requires mask-wearing for flights going in and coming out. So, in a sense, that has already been addressed.",2,37,014-001-095-079-009-037,350
2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr S Iswaran,"Our general posture on mask-wearing is really for compliance with the source country's or destination country's requirements. If you are going to a country that requires the wearing of masks whilst in flight, then the airline will advise you to do so, and then, you wear the mask; and likewise, on the return leg.",3,38,014-001-095-079-009-038,351

2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"  Minister Iswaran left the wastewater testing to me. As I mentioned in my Statement, wastewater testing, at least for the ones we use in Singapore, works by detecting viral fragments from solid waste, not from urine. Therefore, we used it in dormitories, in housing estates, even in nursing homes, it is quite a challenge because many old folks use diapers. Therefore, for a flight from China to Singapore, it is quite a short duration; so, I think that the use of wastewater test will capture a very small sample and is, therefore, not very useful.",1,40,014-001-095-079-009-040,353

2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"  A clarification. Thank you, Sir. Minister Ong said we required the tourists, the in-flights, people, if they did board the plane, they have to declare that vaccination status right now. What is the definition of a full vaccination for that matter because in Singapore, the full vaccination status, if you take non-mRNA is three shots. So, what is the definition of that?",1,44,014-001-095-079-009-044,357
2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"Secondly, do we require – maybe Minister for Transport can advise us – do we require an air traveller to buy COVID-19 insurance as he comes to Singapore?",2,45,014-001-095-079-009-045,358
2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"  We do require medical insurance if you are not fully vaccinated. But the Member is right that, in Singapore, as Members are aware, MOH has revised our vaccination status definition. We require minimum protection, which is three shots, mRNA or four shots, Sinovac. And after that, we require another additional shot five months to 12 months after the previous shot to keep yourself up-to-date. So, our definition is quite a tight one. World Health Organization (WHO) has a more relaxed definition. We know our definition is different and stricter than WHO's, which is currently applied on travellers. It is not practical to fully align the vaccination definition for people living here and for travellers from all around the world because every country has their own definition. And that is why we use the WHO definition, which is less strict on travellers from all sources.",1,46,014-001-095-079-009-046,359

2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr Ong Ye Kung,  Thank you. Very critical question. What do we do when we detect a new dangerous variant?,1,52,014-001-095-079-009-052,365
2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Let me make a few points.,2,53,014-001-095-079-009-053,366
2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"One, there are a lot of sub-variants. Omicron alone, there are about 650 Omicron sub-variants. So, if you jump at every one, you will be jumping every day, twice, right? Because sub-variants can really differ very minimally, just like a human, you are wearing a different shirt, different watch, different shoes, different earrings. That is about it. You are essentially still the same person. So, we cannot jump at every sub-variant, no matter how sexy the name sounds. There are just so many sub-variants.",3,54,014-001-095-079-009-054,367
2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But keep our eyes and ears on the ground with the global surveillance system. Look out for those that is more dangerous. If there is one, then we think about what we should do. And we can see how some countries are implementing. Mr Melvin Yong suggested masks on planes, not unthinkable, PDT and so on and so forth. But a popular one is PDT.",4,55,014-001-095-079-009-055,368
2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The second point to note is that PDT is not foolproof. In fact, it is quite leaky. Why? Because, first, you can be incubating and you test before you board the plane, you are negative on the plane or, upon arrival, you develop disease and you become positive. And then, leaks will happen.",5,56,014-001-095-079-009-056,369
2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Therefore, if you want PDT to be a little more tight, you also implement an OAT, on-arrival test. But still, for a short flight, you might be incubating before you board and also landing. And then, for the next three days you are incubating. And therefore, that is still not enough, you want to be even tighter, you implement SHN, stay-home notice. All these sounds familiar. That was what we did – PDT, OAT, SHN. And soon, you have a big border control system, testing everyone before they board; testing everyone after they board, dedicated a taxi driving you to your homes and then using devices to make sure they stay at home. And then, there is still not foolproof, because one day, a traveller may pass it to a driver, and driver goes home, he goes for big lo-hei dinner, passed it to many other people. And then, next thing you need to think about is safe mangement measures (SMMs), social restrictions.",6,57,014-001-095-079-009-057,370
2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We always have the mindset that border measures is a substitute for domestic community measures. Actually, it is not. They are all complementary; they go together. Once you implement one, you must be prepared that the rest are going to follow because that is how transmissible the virus is. One is not the substitute of the other. They all come in a package unfortunately.",7,58,014-001-095-079-009-058,371
2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Third point is that, certain protocol that the Member mentioned, PDT, OAT, SHN or combination, can buy us time. And that can be very valuable. Therefore, why do we buy ourselves time? Let us say we detect something that sounds serious which you can recall, when we first detected Omicron coming from Africa, we have to implement a combination of those measures. We know it will not shut out the virus, but it buys us time for scientific data to come out, because in a matter of weeks, you can know the characteristic and the parameters that matter. How long does it incubate? How fast does it transmit? To what extent does it translate into severe cases? Does it affect old people more or young people more? That is actually an important parameter. Once you know these parameters, then you can decide your next step. If the parameters turned out that it is not something very serious, then you can stand down, false alarm. There will be some damage to livelihoods and inconveniences but, at least, we stand down.",8,59,014-001-095-079-009-059,372
2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But if your nightmare comes true, this is very transmissible and very deadly, then, you have to hunker down. We have to hunker down again, back to almost square one – contact tracing, SMMs, border measures, everything come in, again to buy us even more time. Even more time for what purpose? Even more time so that a new effective vaccine come on stream. With mRNA technology, hopefully, that can happen in 100 days and that is why it is important to go onto the mRNA platform.",9,60,014-001-095-079-009-060,373

This is roughly the idea. But when something like that happens, expect lots of uncertainties, some confusion, it would not be straightforward, a lot of judgement calls will be required.",10,61,014-001-095-079-009-061,374
2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr S Iswaran,"  Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for her clarification. As I have stated earlier in my reply, whether you look at it in terms of flights or in terms of passenger volumes, we are well below where we were, in fact, 10% – or less – compared to pre-COVID-19. So, there is clearly significant scope to restore air connectivity and the passenger flows between China and Singapore.",1,62,014-001-095-079-009-062,375
2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr S Iswaran,"Having said that, I am reluctant to put a timeline to this process and the reason is because there are several variables that we need to take into account. First, just from a commercial point of view, the number of applications from airlines and so on, although all indications are that there will be strong demand. But, beyond that is, of course, the public health situation that is evolving. We also need to take into account Changi Airport's own ability to manage any increases and to do so in a manner that ensures safe and smooth travel for passengers.",2,63,014-001-095-079-009-063,376
2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr S Iswaran,"So, a variety of factors.

I think unlikely, but neither will we be at a standstill.

2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"In the past before COVID-19, returning Singaporeans do not need to do health declaration at the customs. But now, we have to do that and do it via online or physical. I mean, I can understand we need to do some of these border checks like PDTs, but for SG Arrival Card where we ask some generic questions  where you come from, Africa or Latin America or Middle East. And then, ask those questions like, ""in the last seven days, have you been unwell"" and so on. We can say yes to all three questions, but you will still be granted entry, you will still be allowed entry to Singapore and there is no follow-up. I just want to ask whether what purpose does this serve to do that, to have that, say, that SG Arrival Card process?",2,72,014-001-095-079-009-072,385

But because of COVID-19, everything went digital. So, now, SG Arrival Card has become a digital declaration. And in that process, MOH gone through with ICA very thoroughly and reduced the questions to bare minimum to the extent that the Member feel may not be so helpful. Maybe we will review to see whether we can add a few more questions.

2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But the purpose is, it is not targeted at COVID-19 but targeted at MERS, at Ebola, monkeypox and so on, that can arise and can infect travellers. While travellers declare whether they feel well or unwell, the fact is they leave behind a contact. So, if someone falls sick, goes to a doctor and we detect is MERS, for example – we are always on the lookout for MERS – we know which flight the person came off, who are their close contacts and if we want to do contact tracing, we can do so through the SG Arrival Card mechanism. It is one of those things we keep in the background – useful to have, and if we need to trigger some action, the information will be valuable.",3,75,014-001-095-079-009-075,388

2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"The first one is about hospital capacity. I understand that currently, in terms of bed utilisation and ICU utilisation, the capacity levels are very high – for some of the public hospitals is 90% or even, well above 90%. So, notwithstanding the regime of PDT and full vaccination, it will just take a relatively small number of cases coming in to possibly strain the hospital capacity to a very difficult position. So, I am just wondering if the Government has thought through this extreme or worst case scenario that might happen with the opening up, of capacity being overstrained in a public hospital system.",2,78,014-001-095-079-009-078,391
2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"The second supplementary question is on the prescription of Paxlovid, which is the COVID-19 anti-viral drug. I understand that there are 36 clinics now that can prescribe it. Is there plan to expand this across the whole primary healthcare system?",3,79,014-001-095-079-009-079,392
2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"  On hospital capacity, indeed, this is one of the key considerations I mentioned in the Statement just now. Today, the number of COVID-19 inpatients is actually low. I cannot remember how many exactly, but it is in the low tens. So, it is actually not burdening our hospital system. However, the hospital system utilisation of non-ICU wards is high because we are ageing – more people are falling sick.",1,80,014-001-095-079-009-080,393
2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"COVID-19 affected that indirectly because it delayed the opening of some major public health facilities. Woodlands Healthcare campus, for example, delayed for two to three years. We hope it can start opening end of this year. It will greatly relieve the burden currently of high utilisation rate of hospital beds.",2,81,014-001-095-079-009-081,394
2023-01-09,Safe and Orderly Restoration of Singapore's Air Connectivity,014-001-095-079-009,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"You cannot rush the building of a hospital, but what we can do, which I have announced and explained in this House before, is to set up step-down facilities, particularly Transitional Care Facilities (TCF) that proved to be very helpful. That means for patients who do not require acute care, but waiting for step down care or rehabilitative care, they can go to a TCF first. So, that can temporarily relieve the situation.",3,82,014-001-095-079-009-082,395

First, a requirement for Institutional Creditors (ICs) making bankruptcy applications to apply for Private Trustees in Bankruptcy, which I will call PTIBs, to be appointed as the trustee administering the bankruptcy, instead of the OA.

For instance, in jurisdictions like the United States and Canada, the law mandates the appointment of the equivalent of PTIBs for every bankruptcy case in those jurisdictions.

Along the way, there might be realisable assets that are called in, and this includes property acquired after a bankruptcy order as well. So, all that collectively comes out of the bankrupt estate and it goes towards the PTIBs' fees.",8,158,014-001-095-079-011-158,568

The answer is no. These firms take on the work pre-bankruptcy – so they might go and recover debts; they might go and issue demands and so on. But once the bankruptcy takes place, that is when the PTIBs step in.

So, when you asked about what happens when there is no such PTIB, or, in what cases can the OA step in, I would say as a starting point that it has got to be very narrow. That would be in line with the philosophy of this Bill – to keep it narrow so that parties go to the PTIBs.

More Singaporeans and employers are participating in upskilling and reskilling. The Government's investment in CET has also increased significantly.

2023-01-09,SkillsFuture Singapore Agency (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-079-012,Ms Gan Siow Huang,"First, the SSG Act currently has limited provisions to deal specifically with the abuse of SSG funding. Today, SSG can recover wrongly obtained funds through contractual and civil actions. But recovering funds through civil action can be costly and time consuming. More importantly, it does not effectively deter potential abusers from trying to wrongly obtain funds for purposes other than what they are intended for.",8,12,014-001-095-079-012-012,635

Beyond this, SSG will have to rely on the Penal Code to prosecute egregious cases of cheating.",9,13,014-001-095-079-012-013,636
2023-01-09,SkillsFuture Singapore Agency (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-079-012,Ms Gan Siow Huang,It is necessary to expand the set of offences regulated under the SSG Act to comprehensively and clearly cover the different forms of funding abuse that may arise.,10,14,014-001-095-079-012-014,637
2023-01-09,SkillsFuture Singapore Agency (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-079-012,Ms Gan Siow Huang,"Second, SSG's levers to deal with false or misleading advertisements are limited today. When SSG detects these cases, SSG relies on contractual levers to terminate the errant entity's status as an approved training provider, preventing them from offering SSG-subsidised courses further. However, SSG does not have legislative levers to direct errant entities to take remedial actions such as to take down or correct these advertisements.",11,15,014-001-095-079-012-015,638

2023-01-09,SkillsFuture Singapore Agency (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-079-012,Ms Gan Siow Huang,"First, clause 12 inserts section 57B to define ""abusive funding arrangement"" as one where a person obtains funding that they would not have gotten or higher than what they would have otherwise gotten from SSG.",15,19,014-001-095-079-012-019,642
2023-01-09,SkillsFuture Singapore Agency (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-079-012,Ms Gan Siow Huang,Clause 12 also inserts section 57C to set out a specific offence for entering into or facilitating an abusive funding arrangement.,16,20,014-001-095-079-012-020,643
2023-01-09,SkillsFuture Singapore Agency (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-079-012,Ms Gan Siow Huang,The key elements of the new offence are as follows  (a) the offenders must have entered into or facilitated an abusive funding arrangement which I have just described; (b) they must have known or have had reason to believe that the funding arrangement is abusive in nature; and (c) they must have entered into or facilitated the abusive funding arrangement with the intention to dishonestly or fraudulently induce SSG to provide funding to them or to someone else.,17,21,014-001-095-079-012-021,644

2023-01-09,SkillsFuture Singapore Agency (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-079-012,Ms Gan Siow Huang,A past example of an abusive funding arrangement that is not covered by the current SSG Act was where training providers colluded with several companies to apply for grants from SSG. Individuals were recruited to be employees for the sole purpose of attending a course and drawing training grants from SSG. The individuals' employment was terminated after the course.,19,23,014-001-095-079-012-023,646

2023-01-09,SkillsFuture Singapore Agency (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-079-012,Ms Gan Siow Huang,"Second, clause 12 inserts the new section 57E to set out a specific offence for publication or distribution of an advertisement that is false or misleading in a material way. Subsection 4 under the new section 57E defines a ""false or misleading advertisement"" as an advertisement that falsely represents that SSG has provided funding, approval or endorsement for a course or its provider when this is not the case. It also includes an advertisement that falsely represents the contents or skill sets that would be acquired through attending an SSG-funded course.",21,25,014-001-095-079-012-025,648
2023-01-09,SkillsFuture Singapore Agency (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-079-012,Ms Gan Siow Huang,"The definitions are based on actual cases of misrepresentations that SSG has encountered. For example, courses were advertised to be funded by SSG, accredited under the Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) credentials or would lead to a government-issued diploma when they are not. This misleads individuals into signing up for unsuitable courses. If left unaddressed, such misrepresentations could undermine public confidence in the SkillsFuture movement.",22,26,014-001-095-079-012-026,649

2023-01-09,SkillsFuture Singapore Agency (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-079-012,Ms Gan Siow Huang,We also intend to give SSG powers to direct remedial actions under the new section 57F in the SSG Act as inserted by clause 12. SSG can direct remedial actions if it assesses a person has published or distributed such false or misleading advertisement or caused them to be published or distributed. Examples of appropriate remedial actions include removing the false and misleading advertisement and publishing a corrective advertisement as approved by SSG.,24,28,014-001-095-079-012-028,651
2023-01-09,SkillsFuture Singapore Agency (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-079-012,Ms Gan Siow Huang,"In addition, to better safeguard public interests, clause 12 inserts the new section 57G to empower SSG to direct training providers and other recipients of SSG funding to refund monies paid by trainees and/or funding provided by SSG if the course did not start on the scheduled start date or ceases to be provided before it is completed.",25,29,014-001-095-079-012-029,652

2023-01-09,SkillsFuture Singapore Agency (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-079-012,Ms Gan Siow Huang,"However, SSG currently has to rely on contractual levers and civil proceedings to recover the funds that have been wrongly obtained as a result of such false or misleading information.

2023-01-09,SkillsFuture Singapore Agency (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-079-012,Ms Gan Siow Huang,"Further, I would like to assure Members that there will be due process where SSG exercises these expanded regulatory powers. For example, before directing a person to remove an advertisement or to refund trainees or SSG if the course is cancelled, SSG will first give a written notice for the person to submit written representations to explain their actions unless it is not practicable or desirable within a reasonable specified timeline. SSG will decide whether to issue the direction or to modify it after considering the written representation by the person. If a person is aggrieved by SSG's direction, the person can appeal to the Minister. Clause 12 will insert section 57H to provide for this.",31,35,014-001-095-079-012-035,658
2023-01-09,SkillsFuture Singapore Agency (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-079-012,Ms Gan Siow Huang,"In view of the new offences, SSG's enforcement powers will need to be enhanced. Under the SSG Act today, SSG's enforcement powers are for limited purposes, mainly to verify information submitted to SSG for SSG funding as well as to ensure that SSG funding had been properly applied by the funding recipient. Persons authorised by SSG may enter premises, take photos and videos, access documents and ask for returns within a specified period. However, these powers are limited and are not sufficient for the investigation of offences.",32,36,014-001-095-079-012-036,659

2023-01-09,SkillsFuture Singapore Agency (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-079-012,Ms Gan Siow Huang,"Currently, offences and enforcement powers relating to incentives, grants or loans are set out in the SDL Act or SSG Act, depending on whether the funding source is SDF monies or non-SDF monies. Clause 6 of the SDL (Amendment) Bill repeals the offence and related provisions concerning SSG funding out of SDF monies. Offences relating to SSG funding, paid wholly or partly out of SDF monies, will be ported over to the SSG Act from the SDL Act and will be enforced using enforcement powers under the SSG Act. Offences and enforcement powers that pertain to the levy will remain in the SDL Act.",38,42,014-001-095-079-012-042,665
2023-01-09,SkillsFuture Singapore Agency (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-079-012,Ms Gan Siow Huang,"Second, we will make it easier for employers to compute SDL liabilities and make monthly contributions for both CPF and SDL. Today, employers use the definition of ""wages"" under the Central Provident Fund Act, or CPF Act, to calculate the CPF payable for their local employees, and a slightly different definition of ""remuneration"" to compute the SDL payable for their employees. For example, certain medical benefits are currently considered part of ""remuneration"" but not part of ""wages"" and therefore subject to SDL and not CPF. This can result in additional administrative burden on employers.",39,43,014-001-095-079-012-043,666
2023-01-09,SkillsFuture Singapore Agency (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-079-012,Ms Gan Siow Huang,"Clause 2 of the SDL (Amendment) Bill will replace the definition of ""remuneration"" in the SDL Act with a definition of ""wages"" as in the CPF Act. We currently intend for employers to adopt the same definition in the CPF Act of what constitutes wages, before applying the respective formulas to compute SDL payable. The computation formula for SDL and the scope of employees for whom SDL is payable, remain unchanged.",40,44,014-001-095-079-012-044,667

This will allow individuals and employers to have greater confidence to participate in training. We will also better protect genuine learners from being misled into taking courses that are of little or no value.

Two, marketing agents soliciting sign-ups without intention to offer a course and submitting claims without individuals' knowledge.

However, not all cases of training grant abuse can constitute an offence as defined under the Penal Code. They are also not covered by current offences under the SSG Act.

From time to time, SSG encounters cases involving misrepresentation of SSG-approved courses or funding information.

Persons who provide false or misleading information will be guilty of an offence, punishable at up to 12 months' imprisonment, or a fine up to $10,000 or both.

Tying enforcement actions to funding can give rise to potentially perverse incentives toward zealous or over-regulation and possible abuse by state authorities.

I agree with this forward-thinking approach. I would only add that the agency should not apply a blanket ban but consider the context as each case may present itself.

Then, there are people, the individuals who submitted false claims without taking any courses. Then, there are some employers are known to falsely submit names of trainees who are not really employees and with the intent to just access SSG grants.

Education Minister Chan Chun Sing has just delivered, a few days ago, a brilliant public speech on the future of the education landscape of Singapore.

First, the Bill will make it an offence for anyone to enter or facilitate an abusive funding arrangement. An errant party guilty of the offence would be punished in three ways – pay a penalty equal to the amount of the wrongly obtained funding; or fined not exceeding $10,000 and/or imprisonment for not exceeding three years; and/or ordered to repay the wrongly obtained funding. My questions are these  one, do the penalties in fine and/or imprisonment commensurate with the size of the offence? For instance, is a fine of $10,000 plus imprisonment sufficient to deter a potential gain of $10 million? Should there or ought there be heavier penalties, as suggested during public consultations?",6,102,014-001-095-079-012-102,725

With more than 1,000 training providers and 25,000 SSG-supported courses, no number of SSG-appointed inspectors will be enough to ensure better governance.

We have seen in 2017, a crime syndicate attempted to defraud SSG of nearly $40 million dollars. In 2018, a HR consultancy tried to cheat SSG of $145,000.

It is heartening to hear that there are already different tiers of funding for training providers. Steps are also in place to remove funding and subsidies from courses, which are deemed to be non-certifiable, to better fund quality ones. Will the Government consider setting up a dedicated channel for users to provide feedback to SSG on courses and trainers?

2023-01-09,SkillsFuture Singapore Agency (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-079-012,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"As such, I believe the Government can do more to provide better quality assurance for SkillsFuture courses. This is so that more Singaporeans are willing to commit their credits, time and energy to these opportunities, at the assurance that they will not be wasted. As of June 2022, only 29% of eligible Singaporeans, aged 25 and above, utilised their SkillsFuture credits for the year.

As enforcement personnel will receive additional investigative powers, where will they receive training in investigative skills? Will we leverage on industry professionals, or the Police, to guide them? Why is there a need for authorised persons and inspectors?

MND finally provided a memo to the Public Petitions Committee on 14 November stating that in a previous SERS at West Coast Road, residents who bought equivalent flats at the ""designated"" West Coast Crescent site, near their existing flats, had received cash payment from the Government of $51,000 for a 3-room flat and $61,000 for a 4-room flat respectively. Only residents who opted for ""a more centrally located replacement site"" at Clementi Avenue 1 were required to top up with cash. Thus, the Government's example of West Coast Road SERS cannot be taken as an example of past SERS residents having to top up cash for an equivalent flat.",4,6,014-001-095-079-016-006,769

It is disingenuous of the Government to have not admitted to the different outcome up till today, even though the outcome is undeniably different.

The reason given is the lease decay. The Minister explained that in past SERS, the flats were generally younger at the point of the SERS announcement, with around 70 years of lease remaining.

He also did not explain why the residents affected by Marsiling SERS which was announced slightly later than the Ang Mo Kio SERS, did not need to top up with cash although the Marsiling flats have a lease balance of only 58 to 59 years which is not much longer than the 57 years remaining for the Ang Mo Kio flats.",8,10,014-001-095-079-016-010,773

At the same time, the prices of new flats in mature estates have risen much faster because they enjoy the benefits of good amenities and location. Therefore, there is a larger price difference between the existing old flats and the new replacement flats in Ang Mo Kio than in Marsiling. This is the key reason why the Ang Mo Kio residents have suffered a worse outcome than that of the residents of the Marsiling SERS and previous SERS when the effect of lease decay had not set in.",9,11,014-001-095-079-016-011,774

There are about 150 blocks, with about 2,000 units without direct lift access, where LUP will incur high cost, and in some cases, not be feasible due to existing technical and site constraints.

First, ICA adopts a dynamic approach in managing traffic at the land checkpoints. Officers are deployed dynamically to areas which require more support to manage traveller volume, while ensuring that other objectives, such as managing security and checking for contraband and security-sensitive items, are not compromised. In addition, clearance lanes are converted flexibly for different modes of conveyance based on the traffic situation. For example, during car departure peaks, more manpower resources are deployed to the car departure zones and lorry departure lanes are converted for car departure clearance. That said, there are limits to the effectiveness of such dynamic deployment. For example, heavy departing car traffic from Woodlands Checkpoint to Malaysia during this year-end period has led to frequent tailbacks at the Causeway, all the way from the Malaysian CIQ to our departure car counters.",3,4,014-001-095-079-035-004,921

2023-01-09,Nuclear Energy Options that Do Not Require Domestically Located Reactor,014-001-095-079-037,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"  Singapore has limited scalable sources of renewable energy domestically. We do not have the land nor sufficient wind speeds for large solar or wind farms, or the rivers needed for hydro-electric power. Therefore, Singapore will need to stay open to various kinds of low-carbon energy sources. It is in this context that the Energy 2050 Committee developed three possible scenarios through which Singapore could achieve net-zero by 2050; of these, the ""Emergent Technology Trailblazer"" scenario included the option of deploying nuclear energy in the future. While advanced reactor designs that are being developed, such as the Small Modular Reactors and ""Generation IV"" technologies, have the potential to be much safer than many of the plants in operation today, most of them are still undergoing research and development and have not begun commercial operations.",1,2,014-001-095-079-037-002,932

Any decision to deploy new energy technologies such as nuclear will be carefully considered against its safety, reliability, affordability and environmental sustainability in Singapore’s context. In addition, these technologies will need to comply with stringent standards in line with the best practices of countries which have experience in ensuring the safety of such technologies.",2,3,014-001-095-079-037-003,933

We will also continue to explore and tap on other low-carbon energy sources such as solar, regional power grids, low-carbon hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS).",3,4,014-001-095-079-037-004,934

Hence, not surprisingly, with the relaxation of border restrictions in April 2022, non-resident employment has increased more quickly as employers backfilled their positions. Overall, non-resident employment has increased by 167,000 from December 2021 to September 2022, but is still 3.9% (44,000) below its pre-COVID level. Non-resident employment growth in the last two quarters was concentrated in Manufacturing and Construction, sectors which are more reliant on non-resident workers.

Significantly, more residents took on jobs in outward-oriented sectors such as Financial and Insurance Services, Information and Communications, Professional Services, as well as in Accommodation, and the median income of full-time employed residents has grown from $4,100 in 2016 to $4,700 in 2021, an increase of 2.1% per annum in real terms. We are in a tight labour market situation, with most unemployment being frictional unemployment. Our resident unemployment rate and resident long-term unemployment rate have recovered to their pre-COVID averages (2.8% and 0.7% respectively). Labour market tightness eased slightly in the third quarter, but the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed persons remained at 2.2, with the bulk of the job vacancies in Manufacturing and Construction, and also in services industries such as Information and Communications and Financial and Insurance Services. As such, I expect total employment to continue growing, but more moderately for residents given the low resident unemployment rate.",3,4,014-001-095-079-038-004,938

From April 2020 to April 2022, around 200,000 locals were placed into jobs, traineeships and attachment opportunities under the NJC’s SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package.

LTA has studied the experiences of other countries and found that installing traffic signal countdown timers did not lead to any significant improvement in road safety. In fact, some jurisdictions that implemented traffic signal countdown timers eventually phased them out. This could be due to motorists speeding up to try to beat the red light and such findings were corroborated during a six-month trial conducted by LTA at the junction of North Bridge Road and Rochor Road. Nevertheless, LTA will continue to monitor and study this and other developments in traffic design, to improve road safety for all users.",1,2,014-001-095-079-088-002,1134

As a result, virtually all FT families have been given a chance to select a flat within their first three tries for an NME BTO flat and almost 90% have been given a chance to select a flat within their first two tries for an NME BTO flat. Applicants are also encouraged to apply for a flat in a town or flat type that has relatively lower application rate. HDB regularly updates the application rates during the application period of a BTO exercise and this information is displayed on HDB InfoWEB for applicants’ reference.

During the MOP, owners are not allowed to leave the flat vacant, or rent out the whole flat without staying in it – this also means that owners are not allowed to rent out their whole flat under the guise of renting out only the bedrooms, by locking up one room and not living in it.

Some may aspire to own a bigger flat or private residential property as their financial situation improves, while others may wish to right-size or to move closer to their parents or children for mutual care and support.

And rental flat tenants who get additional support under the Fresh Start Housing Grant to buy a new HDB flat have to meet a 20-year MOP. During Our Housing Conversations held under the auspices of ForwardSG, we had received several suggestions to strengthen the owner-occupation intent of public housing. For instance, some suggested increasing the MOP for all flat types. Other participants suggested carving out popular BTO projects, such as those in well sought-after locations or areas which have very favourable attributes such as close proximity to amenities and imposing tighter HDB ownership conditions – such as longer MOP – to further deter speculative intent. They say this could be an expansion or variant of the PLH model. And yet, there are other participants who suggested tiered MOPs – for applicants at the same income level, those who accept longer MOPs can get more subsidies, and those with shorter MOPs get much lesser subsidy and pay for BTO flats at close to market price. We are studying the very many views and ideas carefully and will continue to regularly review our housing policies to meet the needs of Singaporeans.",5,8,014-001-095-079-104-008,1200

Between January 2017 and December 2022, a total of 258 BTO flats and 168 resale flats have been returned to HDB, mostly due to changes in owners’ circumstances within the MOP, which rendered them ineligible to own an HDB flat. Circumstances include divorce or separation, demise of the owner, medical reasons and so on.
