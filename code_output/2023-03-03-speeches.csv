2023-03-03,Conducting Island-wide Noise Management Studies in Areas Affected by Multiple Construction Projects,014-001-095-091-001,Mr Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry intends to conduct another island-wide noise measurement study, since the last study was done in 2018, particularly in areas affected by multiple construction projects, such as Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6 which is located in the vicinity of ongoing residential development projects and the North South corridor construction; and (b) when was the last traffic noise impact assessment conducted for Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6,",1,1,014-001-095-091-001-001,1

2023-03-03,Conducting Island-wide Noise Management Studies in Areas Affected by Multiple Construction Projects,014-001-095-091-001,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for Transport),NEA requires LTA's contractors to carry out localised noise impact assessments prior to the commencement of all major infrastructure projects. LTA conducted a noise impact assessment at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6 in 2019 prior to the commencement of North South Corridor (NSC) construction works.,2,3,014-001-095-091-001-003,3

These include erecting noise barriers and noise enclosures, installing mufflers on machineries, using rubber mallets for hammering and carrying out noisier works in the day. However, safety critical works such as the construction of diaphragm walls have to be conducted continuously, which could include working through the night. In such instances, LTA and the Contractors will notify affected stakeholders through circulars and social media platforms.",3,4,014-001-095-091-001-004,4

2023-03-03,Conducting Island-wide Noise Management Studies in Areas Affected by Multiple Construction Projects,014-001-095-091-001,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"  I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. Will the Ministry consider more targeted and frequent noise monitoring at residential developments, which are affected by multiple construction projections managed by different agencies, as the noise can be amplified by these different things that are happening on the ground?",1,7,014-001-095-091-001-007,7
2023-03-03,Conducting Island-wide Noise Management Studies in Areas Affected by Multiple Construction Projects,014-001-095-091-001,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"For instance, Nuovo and Castle Green condominiums along Avenue 6 are affected by noise from the NSC, the MRT line, as well as the BTO construction, all happening within the same vicinity. Will the Ministry of Transport (MOT) also consider constructing noise barriers along the MRT lines near these residential projects?",2,8,014-001-095-091-001-008,8
2023-03-03,Conducting Island-wide Noise Management Studies in Areas Affected by Multiple Construction Projects,014-001-095-091-001,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"  I thank the Member for his supplementary question. There are two parts to this. Firstly, for construction noise, for all construction projects, if they are near residential projects or noise-sensitive facilities, NEA requires these projects to have noise meters installed throughout the projects' duration to monitor the noise levels. And all contractors are required to mitigate the impact of the noise and not exceed the levels stipulated.",1,9,014-001-095-091-001-009,9
2023-03-03,Conducting Island-wide Noise Management Studies in Areas Affected by Multiple Construction Projects,014-001-095-091-001,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"For LTA projects, we go beyond that, in the sense that we do everything that is possible, particularly in major projects like the NSC project, which is a national, major project. We do as much as possible to mitigate noise from the construction. To do this, we erect noise barriers at source, at the construction site near to these residential developments, including like the Member cited – Nuovo condominium, for instance. There are noise barriers that are as high as is practicable, and all the other measures – noise enclosures, mufflers for the heavy machinery and equipment, and so on.",2,10,014-001-095-091-001-010,10
2023-03-03,Conducting Island-wide Noise Management Studies in Areas Affected by Multiple Construction Projects,014-001-095-091-001,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"But the reality would be that it is really not possible to mitigate all noise. We do as much as we can. When there is a need, for instance, for deep excavation, pouring of concrete continuously for the diaphragm walls, we will have to do it through the night and then, we will have to inform the stakeholders.",3,11,014-001-095-091-001-011,11
2023-03-03,Conducting Island-wide Noise Management Studies in Areas Affected by Multiple Construction Projects,014-001-095-091-001,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"With regard to construction of noise barriers along MRT lines, the noise impact assessment studies, for instance that we did in 2018, was to look at certain stretches along the MRT lines and identify where the noise exceeds the recommended level by NEA. For those stretches, noise barriers will be constructed – that is for rail noise. Then, for construction noise, it is barriers and mitigation at source.",4,12,014-001-095-091-001-012,12
2023-03-03,Research to Understand Number of Children Singaporean Women Would Like to Have,014-001-095-091-002,Mr Leon Perera,"asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the Government has conducted any research to understand the number of children that Singaporean women would like to have and the reasons why this may be different from the number they actually do have; and (b) if not, whether it will consider doing so and publishing the findings of the fertility gap and the reasons for it.",1,1,014-001-095-091-002-001,13

However, in practice, married female respondents had less than two children. Common reasons cited for not having more children include concerns over the financial cost and the stress of raising children, and difficulties in managing work and family demands.",2,3,014-001-095-091-002-003,15

However, beyond Government-initiated measures, we need a whole-of-society approach that is supportive of families, values family well-being, and acts accordingly.

2023-03-03,Research to Understand Number of Children Singaporean Women Would Like to Have,014-001-095-091-002,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),  I thank the Minister for replying. I have two supplementary questions.,1,6,014-001-095-091-002-006,18
2023-03-03,Research to Understand Number of Children Singaporean Women Would Like to Have,014-001-095-091-002,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"The first is regarding the survey and the data that she referred to, is this data publicly available and can Singaporeans study the statistical fertility gap within that survey, the gap between the number of children women want to have and how many they actually have? And does that data provide reasons for that gap, including all possible reasons such as housing affordability, for one, which has been discussed before in this House, where there is evidence from another study by an NUS researcher that there is a correlation between high house prices and low total fertility rate (TFR)?",2,7,014-001-095-091-002-007,19
2023-03-03,Research to Understand Number of Children Singaporean Women Would Like to Have,014-001-095-091-002,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"The second supplementary question is, does this study contain – and if not, could future studies address – differences between different segments in Singapore? Because that may be a source of policy ideas if we look at outliers where there are certain segments be it by income or by other characteristics —",3,8,014-001-095-091-002-008,20

2023-03-03,Research to Understand Number of Children Singaporean Women Would Like to Have,014-001-095-091-002,Mr Leon Perera,"  Yes. Where the TFR is higher or the TFR is lower. In America, for example, some research shows higher-income, better educated women have more children. So, can that information also be made available so that we can have a whole-of-society approach to address what is really an existential issue?",1,10,014-001-095-091-002-010,22
2023-03-03,Research to Understand Number of Children Singaporean Women Would Like to Have,014-001-095-091-002,Ms Indranee Rajah,"  Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his clarifications. The survey results are, in fact, publicly available. Mr Perera may have missed them, but they are available. They were published by the Prime Minister's Office, so the survey is available online. I would encourage him to have a look at it.",1,11,014-001-095-091-002-011,23
2023-03-03,Research to Understand Number of Children Singaporean Women Would Like to Have,014-001-095-091-002,Ms Indranee Rajah,"You will see when you look the survey that it actually contains quite a lot of information. The survey was conducted from February to June 2021, with respondents comprising 2,848 single – that means, never married – and 3,017 married Singapore residents, aged 21 to 45 years. In the annex to the survey, there are details of the profile of survey respondents.",2,12,014-001-095-091-002-012,24
2023-03-03,Research to Understand Number of Children Singaporean Women Would Like to Have,014-001-095-091-002,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The highlights of the survey do not indicate housing prices, as Mr Perera mentioned. What was key on their mind were other reasons and let me just highlight them.",3,13,014-001-095-091-002-013,25
2023-03-03,Research to Understand Number of Children Singaporean Women Would Like to Have,014-001-095-091-002,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The first thing among the key findings was that marriage and parenthood aspirations remained strong. So, Singaporeans do want to get married and do want to have children. In terms of the factors that affected having children, the survey showed that in making parenthood decisions, key considerations included the ability to manage the costs of child-raising as well as to manage work and family commitments. Another key consideration was that fathers were equally important as caregivers and could play a greater role at home. And the third key finding was that many agreed that Flexible Work Arrangements make it easier for couples to start a family and have more children.",4,14,014-001-095-091-002-014,26
2023-03-03,Research to Understand Number of Children Singaporean Women Would Like to Have,014-001-095-091-002,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, we do understand that for young couples starting family, having a home is important and you would have seen that in the Budget, the measures to prioritise first-timer families, young families and married couples, are aimed at ensuring that they have a home. And we have had a whole debate on affordability and accessibility. Singaporeans can rest assured that that is very much on our minds and we are making sure that housing is available for those who wish to start families and have children.",5,15,014-001-095-091-002-015,27
2023-03-03,Research to Understand Number of Children Singaporean Women Would Like to Have,014-001-095-091-002,Ms Indranee Rajah,"But the other findings, which were the key findings from this, you can see that this year's Budget, in particular, the Marriage and Parenthood measures are targeted squarely at that. The measures are directed towards financial support for parents. So, the increase in the Baby Bonus cash gift, the CDA top-up, the in the enhancement of the CDA co-matching. That addresses the financial concern. We have doubled the Government-Paid Paternity Leave, which addresses this finding that they wish to see more involvement of the fathers. And the other, which was said in the Budget, and actually, we have said many times but has not yet received as much attention is the Flexible Work Arrangements.",6,16,014-001-095-091-002-016,28
2023-03-03,Research to Understand Number of Children Singaporean Women Would Like to Have,014-001-095-091-002,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Flexible Work Arrangements are sometimes confused with work from home. But it is not equal to work from home. Work from home is a subset of Flexible Work Arrangements, which is a much broader thing. This I think is what would help parents the most – that sense that they would be able to take time off or to be able to arrange their work in such a way that allows them to care for young children. Also bearing in mind that many parents also have to look after their own parents, the grandparents.",7,17,014-001-095-091-002-017,29
2023-03-03,Research to Understand Number of Children Singaporean Women Would Like to Have,014-001-095-091-002,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, Flexible Work Arrangements will be key and hence, that is why in my earlier answer, I indicated that we need a whole-of-society approach, where everyone is supportive or families and family well-being.",8,18,014-001-095-091-002-018,30

Property tax or PT, is our primary means of taxing wealth. PT payable is based on the applicable PT rate, applied to the Annual Value or AV of the property, where AV is a proxy for the property value and thus, the owner's wealth.",1,5,014-001-095-091-003-005,35

Properties with AVs of up to $8,000 pay no PT, while properties with higher AVs pay PT at progressively higher rates of taxation. Owner-occupied residential properties enjoy concessionary PT rates and are taxed at rates lower than non-owner-occupied ones.",2,6,014-001-095-091-003-006,36

I have one clarification for Senior Minister of State. Can MOF share, does Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) have a system to calibrate annual property values as a ratio of all owner- and tenant-occupied properties, to ensure that AVs are not disproportionately skewed by a few high rental units?",1,20,014-001-095-091-003-020,50

The way that IRAS goes about computing AV is that they will, generally, exclude very high and outlier rentals that the properties may fetch. And so, I think this is a way to ensure that the data and the statistics are not skewed by some of these outliers.",1,21,014-001-095-091-003-021,51

Is it the principle of the Government that we would want to persuade them to sell their property, so that they would not be considered wealthy? I mean, how do we define the term ""wealth""?

Property is an asset, and I hope Mr Lim agrees with me on that. An asset is part of your wealth.

I mentioned some examples earlier, in AP, and also when we look at certain schemes that we design.

This was the previous name used before the Bus Contracting Model was introduced in 2016.

The large majority of commuters use them to connect to the MRT and other bus services at key transport nodes. This means, that their commuting needs will be better served with a hub-and-spoke model instead of using intra-town feeder services. The hub-and-spoke model is also more flexible in meeting new demand, for example when a new Built-To-Order (BTO) estate is constructed within the town.",7,73,014-001-095-091-007-073,160

I will not go through the newspaper articles that can substantiate this concern.",2,236,014-001-095-091-007-236,323
2023-03-03,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport) ,014-001-095-091-007,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Minister said that the violations of motorcycle financing would be subject to the Hire Purchase Act.

2023-03-03,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport) ,014-001-095-091-007,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"My second clarification is very short. It pertains to the second point of my cut. Does the Minister have a perspective on the total number of motorcycle COEs transferred to the Open Category over the last 10 years? I use 10 years because it is the lifespan of a COE, even though I note that the practice had been stopped in 2017.",5,239,014-001-095-091-007-239,326

2023-03-03,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport) ,014-001-095-091-007,Mr S Iswaran,"Perhaps, I will start with the second point on COEs and allocation. I think what the Leader of the Opposition is driving at is whether there is a way to re-allocate some of the old COEs. I think that was the point he made earlier because of the old system, which was discontinued in 2017.",2,242,014-001-095-091-007-242,329
2023-03-03,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport) ,014-001-095-091-007,Mr S Iswaran,"First, let me say and I want to reiterate this point. I omitted to mention Mr Fasial Manap's Adjournment Motion, but as I said, I do not think any one party here has a monopoly on the care and concern for motorcycle owners. We all do. We are all endeavouring to help. And the question is, how to best achieve that.",3,243,014-001-095-091-007-243,330
2023-03-03,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport) ,014-001-095-091-007,Mr S Iswaran,"Secondly, let me make the point that we need to be clear about what is the overall intent and structure of the system. So, I start with the vehicle growth rate. We have taken an important albeit difficult decision that the vehicle growth rate will be zero. We have done this because of the overall interest in terms of the liveability of our city and ensuring that even our roads, the flows, the vehicular flows can be sustained, going forward, taking into account road development and all the other modes of transportation that we are developing.",4,244,014-001-095-091-007-244,331
2023-03-03,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport) ,014-001-095-091-007,Mr S Iswaran,"So, that is the first and important consideration, baseline point, that vehicle growth rate is zero. Why is that important? It is important because the moment we agree on that and – I am assuming the Leader of the Opposition agrees with that as a principle. Because if you do, then any mechanism to re-allocate COEs is basically a zero-sum exercise. We have to take it from some other category in order to give it to a more critical category. The Leader of the Opposition's proposal is to take it from, I think, Cat E, or – I cannot remember where.",5,245,014-001-095-091-007-245,332
2023-03-03,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport) ,014-001-095-091-007,Mr S Iswaran,"But there have been similar arguments made for other categories – whether it is for Cat A, whether it is for Cat C, commercial – in this House. So, how do we decide then where to take it from, where to allocate it, how much to allocate and how do you measure that the outcome has been successful? Because, clearly, the intent here is that – and I am reading into the Member's comment – unless prices soften, the desired objective has not been served.",6,246,014-001-095-091-007-246,333
2023-03-03,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport) ,014-001-095-091-007,Mr S Iswaran,But we have to look at any change we make to the COE system holistically for all the reasons I have just highlighted.,7,247,014-001-095-091-007-247,334
2023-03-03,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport) ,014-001-095-091-007,Mr S Iswaran,"So, to propose one particular dimension for modification without looking at the systemic implications, I think would be remiss on our part.",8,248,014-001-095-091-007-248,335
2023-03-03,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport) ,014-001-095-091-007,Mr S Iswaran,"But as I have said, having said that, we have been prepared to take measures.

And we remain ready to do more.",9,249,014-001-095-091-007-249,336

And, as I said, I hope buyers and dealers will take note of this when making their decisions on bidding and buying for Cat D.",10,250,014-001-095-091-007-250,337
2023-03-03,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport) ,014-001-095-091-007,Mr S Iswaran,"The first point that he raised was on the financing elements. First, we should all be very focused on our core mission. And the mission in LTA and for MOT is to make sure that we have agreed on a policy for managing the population of vehicles and we have an allocation mechanism through the COE, and we should ensure that that is working to the best of our ability.",11,251,014-001-095-091-007-251,338
2023-03-03,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport) ,014-001-095-091-007,Mr S Iswaran,"Having said that, financing is essential because most buyers of vehicles, generally, do need financing assistance. Whether we can study further, whether there are any other alternatives, I would say that this is actually better left to the market and to industry players to respond. Because in the end, LTA or the Government is not in a unique position in any way or even in a position where we have special insights into this. The practices – and the Member himself has highlighted, there is a cooperative and so on – the mechanisms exist, in other context perhaps. And it is really best left to the market.",12,252,014-001-095-091-007-252,339

But I think the other context to consider, and I make this appeal to the Minister, is the landscape with regard to what has happened since 2017 and today, insofar as a burgeoning of the gig economy and the need for lower-income Singaporeans to have an affordable mode of transportation to deliver food and whatever else, has changed.",2,256,014-001-095-091-007-256,343
2023-03-03,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport) ,014-001-095-091-007,Mr Pritam Singh,"So, that was the context in which I raised the argument that covered a previous policy of LTA, which was to take COEs from the motorcycle Cat D and put it to the Open Category. And I was wondering whether there could be some considerations because of the landscape, to see whether it is feasible to consider a transfer back. And in my cut, I use the word ""equity and fairness"". It is not meant to dilute the Minister's response of the larger task of re-allocation from other categories as well. I take that point.",3,257,014-001-095-091-007-257,344
2023-03-03,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport) ,014-001-095-091-007,Mr Pritam Singh,"On the point of the market, indeed, ultimately, that is the bedrock that has to sustain financing. But in view of the Forward Singapore exercise, I think there was an exercise which looked at the prospect of cooperatives partnering businesses to better manage finance. I am wondering whether the Ministry could nudge our cooperatives to consider providing loans for lower-income Singaporeans so as to ensure that the arbitrage that motorcycle financers gain is not overly large, to the detriment of lower-income Singaporeans who need these bikes in the first place.",4,258,014-001-095-091-007-258,345

But we have to be very clear that in our desire to do so, we do not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Because it is a system that in general has worked. But let us also be clear  why we are discussing this today is because the prices have gone up.

We should encourage it, I fully agree with that. As the Leader of the Opposition said, if there is an arbitrage possibility and if the market is functioning well, then somebody would take advantage of the arbitrage and come in – whether it is a cooperative or another finance business or whatever.

It is going to have to require ongoing efforts around public education because medical treatment does change. I think the key issue is that if the provider is licensed, they are required only to assert claims that are provable and demonstrable.

But for infant care teachers, I am quite sure many of us are experiencing that there is a long waitlist. There, certainly, is a long waitlist at the preschool centres in my constituency. Therefore, my first clarification is, what can we do to increase the supply of infant care teachers, so that it will help to shorten the queues for them?",2,4,014-001-095-091-011-004,1604
2023-03-03,Committee of Supply – Head I (Ministry of Social and Family Development),014-001-095-091-011,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"My second clarification is to the Minister. We are heartened by the top-up of $300 million into the ComCare Endowment Fund. We know that the cost of living has gone up. My simple question is, on the review of both ComCare and Public Assistance scheme, when is this due, because for all those who are receiving these, the last year, in particular, has been quite hard on them.",3,5,014-001-095-091-011-005,1605
2023-03-03,Committee of Supply – Head I (Ministry of Social and Family Development),014-001-095-091-011,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"And my third clarification is for Senior Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua. I refer to a suggestion by Mr Leon Perera where he suggested that we could dispense for SSOs to probably dispense or simplify the need to verify certain documents. My own take is that we need to be cautious about this. I would rather say and hope that, instead, SSOs be empowered more to exercise greater flexibility to work within the guidelines and yet, exercise flexibility on a case-by-case basis as they evaluate each of these ComCare applicants.",4,6,014-001-095-091-011-006,1606
2023-03-03,Committee of Supply – Head I (Ministry of Social and Family Development),014-001-095-091-011,Ms Sun Xueling,"  I thank the Member for his clarifications. We all recognise that, indeed, we do have a shortage of manpower in the early childhood industry. Currently, our manpower stands at 24,000 persons. As I have mentioned in my main speech, we would need an additional 2,500 persons to join the early childhood sector by 2025. The Member is right that it is in the areas of infant care educators, infant care carers, that we do face an acute shortage.",1,7,014-001-095-091-011-007,1607
2023-03-03,Committee of Supply – Head I (Ministry of Social and Family Development),014-001-095-091-011,Ms Sun Xueling,"So, ECDA has embarked on a three-pronged approach.

We are also working with AOPs, where possible, for them to consider diverting their manpower internally so that there is good deployment between infant care and childcare where they are operating in the same premises.",3,9,014-001-095-091-011-009,1609

The ComCare Short and Medium-Term Assistance (SMTA) and the Long-Term Assistance (LTA) were just reviewed in August 2022. So, we raised that from $600 to $640, and have higher cash assistance for the LTA. But we must continue to monitor this current increase in inflation, which is not the usual one, creeping slowly, but given the circumstances that are faced by people all over the world. We will look at this and, if the need arises, we will certainly increase the support to our ComCare recipients.",1,12,014-001-095-091-011-012,1612

But having said that, the income eligibility criteria are not hard thresholds because the SSOs can assess holistically the family, their needs, because if their basic needs cannot be met, no matter what their income is presented to be, the SSOs do have the discretion to support them. Therefore, we do have flexibility to exercise on a case-by-case basis.",2,13,014-001-095-091-011-013,1613

2023-03-03,Committee of Supply – Head I (Ministry of Social and Family Development),014-001-095-091-011,Mr Eric Chua,"  Chairman, I thank the Member for his suggestion and his comment. I agree and I just want to go on to add – and also to add to Minister Masagos' point – about the fact that the SSO GMs and staff do have some discretion, especially when giving out quick and immediate support. Oftentimes, we get feedback that SSO applications take about four to six weeks to get approved. That is for a large percentage of all cases that come in. But beyond that, the GMs do have some discretionary funds within each SSO for them to take some quick actions as well. I just wanted to add on to that.",1,15,014-001-095-091-011-015,1615

I appreciate the points made by Senior Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua. Just one supplementary question. That is in relation to the suggestions I made about significantly enhancing the ComCare grant quantums in line with minimum income standard research, extending the runway perhaps to a year and making the application process less onerous in terms of interviewing family members and documents and so on.",1,17,014-001-095-091-011-017,1617
2023-03-03,Committee of Supply – Head I (Ministry of Social and Family Development),014-001-095-091-011,Mr Leon Perera,"My clarification would be  would the Ministry be open to experimentation, doing a pilot to see if we do these things and make significant changes, whether the net benefits will outweigh the risk or the downside in terms of reducing that bandwidth tax, reducing the stress, enabling that trampoline effect where families are able to plan ahead and plan a turnaround in their life? And also, just improving the outcomes of their children as they go through this life that they have to go through, which they did not choose to go through.",2,18,014-001-095-091-011-018,1618

2023-03-03,Committee of Supply – Head I (Ministry of Social and Family Development),014-001-095-091-011,Mr Eric Chua,"I think, first of all, it is the reference to the minimum income study. I think that has been covered in the last COS and addressed by Minister Masagos. I will not go into great detail on that. I think our position on that has been clear; there have been previous press releases by the Ministry of Finance as well with regard to that study.",2,21,014-001-095-091-011-021,1621

I think the Member also was nodding away when I was talking about SupportGoWhere and ComCare applications being made easy through SupportGoWhere. That is just the start of our entire journey. We are on the cusp of change in the social service delivery landscape, if I could put it that way.

Of course, this is more operational than policy that they have one point of contact for all the different services, have the befriender and the ComLink engagement officer working together to make sure that what is presented in terms of an action plan to each family is coherent, it is not obfuscating to the family, it is not confusing to the family.",6,25,014-001-095-091-011-025,1625

I would like to direct my question to Senior Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua. I think to commend MSF for taking on this very bold experiment. I feel like ComLink is almost undertaking a massive endeavour that is similar to what social service agencies might do. So, my question is, does the ComLink programme have headcounts within MSF that play a dedicated volunteer management role? Yes, that is my question.

And Ms Carrie Tan, being in this sector for a long time, would know that we want those who are big-hearted, red-blooded and have a big heart for ComLink families to be able to journey with them for the long haul. Because we are not talking about volunteering for ad hoc occasions, we are talking about going at it for months and sometimes, perhaps, even for a couple of years, at least, with each family, understanding them in depth and then proposing and perhaps, nudging and working through with these families – as equals, of course – on the situations that they are in.",5,34,014-001-095-091-011-034,1634
