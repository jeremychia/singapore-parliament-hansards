2021-07-26,Curbing Scam Calls Made From +65 Prefix Phone Numbers,014-001-095-033-002,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether the Ministry is able to do more to limit the number of +65 scam calls made to unsuspecting Singaporeans; and (b) whether the Ministry and local telcos can expand its scam awareness outreach efforts offline particularly to the elderly who have no knowledge of such apps.,1,1,014-001-095-033-002-001,8
2021-07-26,Curbing Scam Calls Made From +65 Prefix Phone Numbers,014-001-095-033-002,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Communications and Information),"  Mr Deputy Speaker, MCI and IMDA work closely with MHA in the Inter-Ministry Committee on Scams to strengthen our whole-of-Government efforts to protect Singaporeans against scams. One key initiative, which the Member cited is our effort to combat scam phone calls from overseas. The +65 prefix which we implemented with telcos in April last year helps to alert the public that these are calls coming from overseas and that the public should not pick up such calls if they are not expecting anyone calling from overseas. This is part of our broader anti-scam efforts, including the expeditious blocking of known numbers used to perpetuate scams or those attempting to spoof the numbers of Government agencies.",1,2,014-001-095-033-002-002,9

2021-07-26,Curbing Scam Calls Made From +65 Prefix Phone Numbers,014-001-095-033-002,The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Communications and Information),"The technological solutions that we implement need to be complemented by measures to heighten the awareness and vigilance of the public. In this spirit, IMDA teaches seniors cyber safety tips such as how to identify spoofed scam calls via its Seniors Go Digital programme. The Government has also partnered key stakeholders like the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC), banks and telcos to disseminate anti-scam messages. These efforts take place online and offline, in order to reach out to a wider audience, including vulnerable segments in our society.",3,4,014-001-095-033-002-004,11

The NCPC’s crime prevention ambassadors also reach out to seniors to share crime prevention tips at various community events.",4,5,014-001-095-033-002-005,12

2021-07-26,Curbing Scam Calls Made From +65 Prefix Phone Numbers,014-001-095-033-002,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"  I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State for the answer. I have two supplementary questions. I believe many Members in this House have asked this question about the +65 scam calls. The first question I have is, I have been receiving a lot of questions from residents about the +65 scam calls and it seems that the trend has increased quite significantly. So, the first question is whether MCI and MHA would look into blocking the source of these +65 calls in a more concerted way.",1,7,014-001-095-033-002-007,14
2021-07-26,Curbing Scam Calls Made From +65 Prefix Phone Numbers,014-001-095-033-002,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Secondly, how much more can we educate our elderly residents and even young residents or adults who may unsuspectingly pick these calls up and combined with scam and phishing efforts of these perpetrators, lead to further worsening exposure of our residents to such efforts.",2,8,014-001-095-033-002-008,15
2021-07-26,Curbing Scam Calls Made From +65 Prefix Phone Numbers,014-001-095-033-002,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"  Mr Deputy Speaker, indeed, the Ministries and agencies involved will continue to monitor and are concerned about an increased trend in attempted scam calls and spoof calls using the +65 prefix. We will try to work upstream.",1,9,014-001-095-033-002-009,16
2021-07-26,Curbing Scam Calls Made From +65 Prefix Phone Numbers,014-001-095-033-002,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"There is unfortunately a problem in that there are also legitimate calls that will end up using the +65 prefix, for example, Singaporeans who are roaming overseas and calling back home. But we will continue our efforts and we are as concerned as the Member.",2,10,014-001-095-033-002-010,17
2021-07-26,Curbing Scam Calls Made From +65 Prefix Phone Numbers,014-001-095-033-002,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"As far as education, indeed, that is the key. The main prevention is going to be the vigilance of the public, the awareness of what a scam might look like, what they may be trying to get away with. In this, the education and outreach is not confined only to the specifics of a scam call or a spoof call, as our general efforts to education the public around using online technologies, digital technologies – which are often what the scam calls are trying to extract value from; as people have a comfort and understanding about those things; they will become more vigilant, more understanding about what is possible and what needs to be protected in this space. We thank all stakeholders in our community who have helped to spread the word on this.",3,11,014-001-095-033-002-011,18
2021-07-26,Help for Individuals Affected by Bank-related Cyber Scams or Unauthorised Bank Transactions,014-001-095-033-003,Ms Yeo Wan Ling,"asked the Prime Minister (a) in the last six months, whether there is an increase in successful bank-related cyber scams or unauthorised bank transactions involving victims not divulging their OTPs, IDs or passwords to scammers; (b) who bears the financial loss when the unauthorised transaction is not due to the banks’ lapses or non-compliance with Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) rules and the consumer has not given his login information to a third party; and (c) whether victims who suffer financial loss can be given financial help during the period of investigation and recovery.",1,1,014-001-095-033-003-001,19
2021-07-26,Help for Individuals Affected by Bank-related Cyber Scams or Unauthorised Bank Transactions,014-001-095-033-003,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Prime Minister),"  Mr Deputy Speaker, I am taking this question on behalf of the Senior Minister and Minister-in-charge of MAS. Generally, consumers who have suffered financial losses from fraudulent transactions are protected as long as they have acted responsibly.",1,2,014-001-095-033-003-002,20
2021-07-26,Help for Individuals Affected by Bank-related Cyber Scams or Unauthorised Bank Transactions,014-001-095-033-003,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Prime Minister),"For online card transactions, if a merchant has not adopted a system which requires consumers to authorise transactions using one-time passwords (OTPs), a consumer will not be liable for an unauthorised transaction. For lost or stolen cards, a consumer’s liability is capped at $100 for lost or stolen cards, provided he or she has not been careless and has reported the loss promptly.",2,3,014-001-095-033-003-003,21

For unauthorised transactions exceeding this limit, financial institutions will investigate further on the root cause of the issue before liability is established. Where the unauthorised transaction arose because of lapses or non-compliance with MAS’ rules by the financial institution, the consumer will not be liable.",3,4,014-001-095-033-003-004,22
2021-07-26,Help for Individuals Affected by Bank-related Cyber Scams or Unauthorised Bank Transactions,014-001-095-033-003,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Prime Minister),"The question raised by Ms Yeo pertains to a situation where neither the consumer nor the financial institution is at fault. Specifically, the consumer has not given out his credentials to a scammer and there were no lapses or non-compliance on the part of the financial institution. Between September 2020 and February 2021, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) received a total of 89 reports of fraudulent card transactions performed with SMS OTPs, where victims claimed that they neither performed the transactions nor received any SMS OTPs to authorise the transactions. While these cases represent less than 0.1% of fraudulent online card transactions reported and the number of cases has come down since March 2021, it is nonetheless concerning.",4,5,014-001-095-033-003-005,23

MAS has however asked financial institutions to step up vigilance towards such fraud. Financial institutions have put in place additional measures, such as rejecting card payments made to common merchants previously linked to the unauthorised transactions or placing limits on the transaction amounts that consumers can transact with such merchants.",5,6,014-001-095-033-003-006,24
2021-07-26,Help for Individuals Affected by Bank-related Cyber Scams or Unauthorised Bank Transactions,014-001-095-033-003,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Prime Minister),"MAS also expects financial institutions to ensure that consumers are treated fairly whilst investigations are ongoing. For instance, banks have waived finance charges and late fees on the outstanding amounts or offered temporary goodwill credits on the consumers’ credit cards in the interim. For those who wish to settle on the issue, banks may also offer partial waiver of the disputed amounts, taking into consideration individual circumstances, such as financial hardship and whether there were indicators of negligence by the consumers.",6,7,014-001-095-033-003-007,25

The review will include the scenario where neither the consumer nor the financial institution was remiss in allowing the fraud to occur, the scenario that Ms Yeo had asked about. The framework should provide a balance of incentives for all parties to do their part in preventing fraudulent transactions, while ensuring that consumers who are not at fault are protected.",7,8,014-001-095-033-003-008,26
2021-07-26,Help for Individuals Affected by Bank-related Cyber Scams or Unauthorised Bank Transactions,014-001-095-033-003,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"  Thank you, Sir and also, thank you to the Minister for his comprehensive answer. I have one supplementary question. I have seen over the past few months a rise in the number of appeal cases from my residents who have fallen victim to such cyber crimes. They tell me that they have not received any OTPs nor have they divulged their bank account information or credit card information unwittingly. When they go to their banks for investigation, their banks' usual response is that they have divulged their OTPs and hence, the victim, not the bank, is responsible for the loss.",1,9,014-001-095-033-003-009,27
2021-07-26,Help for Individuals Affected by Bank-related Cyber Scams or Unauthorised Bank Transactions,014-001-095-033-003,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"One of my residents, who is a retiree, lost over $10,000 in a string of transactions and she is very sure that she has never given her OTP once, if any. Another resident has told me he has merely done one banking transaction online with a payment platform and before he knew it, he had $1,000 missing from his bank account.",2,10,014-001-095-033-003-010,28

Nevertheless, as I highlighted, this is concerning and we are doing a few things.",2,13,014-001-095-033-003-013,31

2021-07-26,Help for Individuals Affected by Bank-related Cyber Scams or Unauthorised Bank Transactions,014-001-095-033-003,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Thirdly, as I also highlighted, we are working with the industry through the Payments Council to review the framework to provide greater clarity should instances arise where both the financial institution and consumer say, ""Look, we did not do anything""  and the consumer says, ""I never revealed any OTP"", as what Ms Yeo said her residents claimed. So, the banks too have put in place sufficient safeguards, complied with all the rules. What exactly went wrong there? We will have to find out but should such an incident arise and we hope in the future, less and less of it will happen, but should such an incident arise, then, we are looking at the review to see how we can provide greater clarity on the responsibilities of both parties – the banks as well as the consumers – in order to resolve such incidents.",5,16,014-001-095-033-003-016,34

I would like to ask might MAS know what is the total value involved in that 89 cases spoken about? Two, these are hard-earned monies, so, I am wondering whether for some of the fraud cases where the amount that is being cheated, if it is below a certain amount, can the bank just write it off first, so that it reduces the stress on the poor victims. And thirdly, I am glad to know of the review; I am just wondering if there is an indication of the timeline for when this will be done? Technology is fast evolving and so is the nature of crime.

For those of us that have spent some time in the US, we would be aware of the enormous comfort that is provided by the kind of consumer protection legislation where, at the very least, it means that the amount of liabilities that are faced are often capped at a certain amount, once evidence of fraud has been established.

On 11 July 2021, an accident occurred at the Bukit Batok Bus Interchange when a bus that was making a turn within the interchange hit another bus that had just entered the interchange. Following the incident, a bus captain was placed under arrest by the Traffic Police and has been temporarily suspended from active duty by Tower Transit Singapore. The Traffic Police is investigating the accident. As investigations are ongoing, I would refrain from commenting on the cause and contributing factors for the accident.",1,6,014-001-095-033-004-006,52

Bus interchanges are designed to ensure safe movement of passengers and bus captains. Prior to the commencement of operations, LTA conducts analyses and trials to ensure that buses can move around the interchange safely. Buses driving within the interchanges must adhere to a speed limit of 15 kilometres per hour and obey traffic schemes such as the stop lines and the ""Slow"" markings which are prominently painted on the driveways. Bus parking warning systems are also installed to warn bus captains of reversing buses.",3,8,014-001-095-033-004-008,54

The number of accidents involving public buses, not just in bus interchanges but across different settings, has been falling steadily. There were 148 of such accidents between January and May 2021, as compared to 270 in the same period in 2017. The average yearly accident rate for our public buses has been on a downward trend over the last few years, from about 0.15 cases per 100,000 bus-kilometre travelled in 2017, to about 0.10 cases per 100,000 bus-kilometre travelled between January and May 2021.",5,10,014-001-095-033-004-010,56

I recognise that the Interchange itself was built in around 1987. I wonder whether LTA is minded to look into the design, having regard to the fact that buses have become bigger. Also, there may be a need to provide for sufficient safety margins and also extra safety measures to ensure that should something untoward happen, at least there are some structures in place to make sure that the pedestrians', commuters' lives and of course, that of our bus captains', would also not be impacted.",2,20,014-001-095-033-004-020,66

Notwithstanding the presence of these safety features, safe driving is ultimately the most important. Because no matter how much infrastructure we put in, if it is due to human error, the infrastructure cannot completely take that away. So, safe driving, at the end of the day, I think it is still the most crucial and this is what will help to reduce the risk of accidents.",2,22,014-001-095-033-004-022,68

Just one supplementary question, specifically on ransomware. That is an increasing threat around the world and while prevention is better than a cure, many companies do end up paying these ransoms in cryptocurrency.

Additionally, we also see that the threat actors will take notice that an organisation is willing to pay up and, therefore, consider that organisation to be a soft target and, therefore, strike again in future. So, the businesses have to consider what their message is to the cyber criminals. Is your message to them that, well, we have been compromised, we will cough up the ransom as you require? Or is your message that we have taken preventive measures and, yes, we were affected but we were able to recover and we will strengthen our defences?

2021-07-26,Tracking of Mental Health and Stress Levels of Students with Rollout of Subject-Based Banding,014-001-095-033-013,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"So, I am wondering other than the current efforts to recalibrate the examination system and the streaming system, are there current efforts by MOE to enrol parents as co-stakeholders together with teachers to redefine the narratives and expectations of what success looks like, to alleviate the stress that the students are facing in a rather hyper-competitive culture?",3,9,014-001-095-033-013-009,198

MOE has been promoting the concept of multiple pathways to success and not just in relation to Full SBB. I think we heard the response from Minister Maliki earlier as well. There is a continuous conversation and continuous encouragement to society – parents, stakeholders and community partners alike – to expand the way we look at success and acknowledge multiple pathways of success. And this is to help our students develop a growth mindset and also alleviate any mental well-being concerns that may arise from academic stress.",1,10,014-001-095-033-013-010,199

From May, due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases locally and globally, the Government tightened the entry approvals given to MDWs as well as other travellers from countries with higher incidence of COVID-19, so as to manage the risk of COVID-19 importation and local transmission.",1,2,014-001-095-033-014-002,202

They posed a transmission risk to our frontline workers at our checkpoints and at SHN facilities and had to be cared for under our healthcare system.

MOM has also had to postpone the entry of about 1,800 MDWs who had previously received approval to enter Singapore. With a much smaller number allowed to enter, MOM prioritised the entry of MDWs for families with very challenging caregiving needs.",3,4,014-001-095-033-014-004,204

Barring any further tightening of entry approvals by the Government, we hope to progressively schedule the entry of the remaining two-thirds by the end of the year.

The employment agency industry, through the Association of Employment Agencies Singapore (AEAS), has begun a pilot which we announced on 14 July 2021. And this is to implement additional safe management measures in the MDW's home country before they enter Singapore. MOM is monitoring the effectiveness. If the pilot proves successful in lowering the number of imported COVID-19-positive individuals, we can progressively allow for more MDWs to enter under this arrangement.",5,6,014-001-095-033-014-006,206

Not every employer will be able to get entry approval for their MDW before the end of the year. But MOM will continue to prioritise those with urgent care-giving needs. Some prospective MDW employers may have to consider other arrangements until the regional COVID-19 situation improves.

We are all upset by the irresponsible behaviour of the individuals involved in this KTV cluster, but we still have a public responsibility to ensure that everyone receives the medical care that they need. We also do not want individuals, especially those who are infected, to avoid getting tested and treated, or hide where they have been from contact tracers, because they are afraid of getting penalised.

2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As Members can see, while daily infections had gone up sharply over the past couple of weeks, the number of patients with severe illnesses who required oxygen supplementation or are in ICU remained relatively low. There was a slight uptick but relatively suppressed.",2,35,014-001-095-033-015-035,245
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Currently, all of these patients with severe illnesses are either unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. But we are watching this closely because there is a time lag of one to two weeks between infection and the onset of severe illnesses. For now, it would appear that we have successfully weakened the link between infections and severe illnesses.",3,36,014-001-095-033-015-036,246
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"While we are making good progress in vaccinating our people, we acknowledge that the recent reversion to Phase Two (Heightened Alert) has caused some confusion amongst members of the public. They are asking  is the MTF still committed to the path towards normalcy and living with COVID-19?",4,37,014-001-095-033-015-037,247
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The answer is a definite yes. For that is the only way for Singaporeans to regain our lives and livelihoods, for Singapore to reconnect with the world again, for our young to look into the future with hope.",5,38,014-001-095-033-015-038,248
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Some countries, like the UK, have declared a Freedom Day recently, where all social restrictions are lifted all at once. Others, like Israel and the Netherlands, opened up and saw sharp increases in infections and hospitalisations and had had to dial back very quickly.",6,39,014-001-095-033-015-039,249
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Ours will be a controlled opening. We are not going to do a big bang because, predictably, things will then blow up. The MTF has been developing a roadmap comprising packages of measures to be implemented step-by-step over the next few months and with every step, ensuring that opening up is safe for the community.",7,40,014-001-095-033-015-040,250
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But even as we do so, we must bear in mind that until we reach a sufficiently high vaccination rate, especially amongst our seniors, we will continue to be vulnerable to unexpected setbacks – just like what we are going through now.",8,41,014-001-095-033-015-041,251
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"A high rate of vaccination will provide us with a more solid and stable base as we proceed on this journey. The higher the vaccination rate, the more solid the ground we walk on.",9,42,014-001-095-033-015-042,252
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So, in a way, this is the most peculiar period of our transition, where we are clear about our mission, our will is firm, we have a broad plan but we do not have enough antibodies in all of us to ensure that we can follow through our plans without a hitch.",10,43,014-001-095-033-015-043,253
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But let us not underestimate the progress we have made. The roadmap is, in fact, being implemented as we speak. Our attention often is on the Safe Management Measures, or SMMs, such as whether we can eat in restaurants. But there at least three other important aspects, namely  (a) restoring economic and social activities, including connecting with the outside world; (b) remodelling COVID-19 healthcare protocols; and (c) shifting our collective psychology, which, I feel, is probably the hardest.",11,44,014-001-095-033-015-044,254
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Minister Gan Kim Yong will speak about restoring economic activities while Minister Lawrence Wong will speak more about enabling more social activities. Let me talk about healthcare protocols and our collective psychology.,12,45,014-001-095-033-015-045,255
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"As we learn to live with COVID-19, our healthcare protocols must be remodelled. If COVID-19 is, indeed, endemic, having 200 or more cases may not be an unusual thing at all.",13,46,014-001-095-033-015-046,256
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"During an influenza season, our daily infection rates can go up to as high as 1,000 a day. Imagine we treat influenza like we treat COVID-19. This is what will happen.",14,47,014-001-095-033-015-047,257
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We will put everyone suspected of influenza infections through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and then long isolated stays in hospitals. Then, everyone they come into contact with will be quarantined. A thousand cases a day. This will disrupt the lives of many people. Further, hospital beds will all be filled and many other patients who are sicker will be turned away. The healthcare system will not be able to cope and that is clearly not the way to deal with an endemic disease.",15,48,014-001-095-033-015-048,258
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So, if we want to live with COVID-19 as an endemic disease, we cannot carry on with the current healthcare protocols. They need to shift closer to how we treat influenza today – without extensive contact tracing and quarantine in dedicated facilities and hospitalising only those who are very ill.",16,49,014-001-095-033-015-049,259
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But that can only happen when the likelihood of developing a very serious or life-threatening disease as a result of a COVID-19 infection has been significantly reduced by effective vaccination of our population, especially amongst the vulnerable.",17,50,014-001-095-033-015-050,260
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"With our current rate of vaccinations, we have started to take the first transition step to remodel our healthcare protocols. As of last week, we had made the following changes.",18,51,014-001-095-033-015-051,261
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"First, greater use of community care facilities instead of hospitals. Vaccinated individuals aged between 45 and 59 who test positive for COVID-19 and show no or mild symptoms can be directly admitted to community care facilities instead of going first to hospitals. These community care facilities, currently, for example, are NTUC D'Resort as well as Civil Service Club (CSC) Loyang. This was already the practice for all cases aged between 17 and 45, but we are now expanding the protocol to people up to 59 years old.",19,52,014-001-095-033-015-052,262
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"With this change, we expect up to 60% of infected cases to recover in community care facilities instead of in acute care hospitals. Meanwhile, we will plan for the next step. This is just the first step. We will plan for the next one where perhaps 80% can be admitted to community care facilities and some can even start to recover at home.",20,53,014-001-095-033-015-053,263
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The second change is, we have shortened the length of stay in hospitals and community care facilities. Our tests have shown that the viral load in infected persons who are fully vaccinated falls very rapidly to a very low level after nine days. Previously, most people, generally, were discharged only after 21 days. We are now discharging fully vaccinated persons after 14 days from the onset of illness, with a seven-day leave of absence in addition, so long as their tests show that they are COVID-19 negative or have very low viral loads.",21,54,014-001-095-033-015-054,264
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,We are reviewing our policy to allow fully vaccinated patients to be discharged even earlier and to complete the rest of the isolation period at home if their home environment is suitable.,22,55,014-001-095-033-015-055,265
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The third change is the greater use of home quarantines. For fully vaccinated persons, they can now serve their quarantine at home instead of at a dedicated Government facility, provided that their home is suitable for isolation. We expect that up to 40% of persons under quarantine can serve their quarantine at home and this will go beyond 50% in the coming few weeks as more people get vaccinated.",23,56,014-001-095-033-015-056,266
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"These are amongst the first steps that we will take in the healthcare transition. In the meantime, what we are experiencing in this current wave of transmission is also valuable because we are also witnessing a palpable shift in our collective psychology.",24,57,014-001-095-033-015-057,267
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The first, I think, is a shift away from always focusing on infection numbers. We used to get a shock when we see high daily numbers because this will mean that a week or two from then, we will see more severe illnesses and deaths.",25,58,014-001-095-033-015-058,268
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"However, in recent days, that mental link is starting to be broken as we know that, with vaccinations, high infection numbers need not necessarily mean more sickness and deaths.",26,59,014-001-095-033-015-059,269
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Many people are now rightfully focusing on the number of people with severe illnesses. As of today, despite the higher infection cases over the past few days, that number is 14 and does not threaten our hospital capacity.",27,60,014-001-095-033-015-060,270
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Many friends, including Members of this House, have been texting and asking me  why do we not publish the number of people with severe illnesses so that we know that vaccination works?",28,61,014-001-095-033-015-061,271
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Actually, the media have been publishing these numbers every day for quite a while now. But our attention is always on the infection numbers. It is good that the attention is now shifting. I will not say that there is a huge psychological shift but I think the shift is starting to happen.",29,62,014-001-095-033-015-062,272
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,A second shift is a greater acceptance of differentiated safe management measures between those who are vaccinated and those who are not. There have been many calls to do this. Mr Xie Yao Quan has also asked about this.,30,63,014-001-095-033-015-063,273
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"This is something which the MTF has always intended to do. That was why we decided on the ""two-five rule"" for restaurants when the KTV cluster broke out. But it was scuttled with our reversion to Phase Two (Heightened Alert).",31,64,014-001-095-033-015-064,274
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"When our whole society is very highly vaccinated and we have transitioned to living with COVID-19, we should make very little differentiation between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated. But during this period of transition, when we are still building up our resilience, differentiation by vaccination status is a practical way to open up some activities first while protecting those who are still vulnerable.",32,65,014-001-095-033-015-065,275
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,The MTF will revisit this during our Phase Two (Heightened Alert) midpoint review and Minister Lawrence Wong will speak more about that later.,33,66,014-001-095-033-015-066,276
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Let me address several other questions from Members.,34,67,014-001-095-033-015-067,277
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Mr Murali Pillai will be comforted to know that MOH actively monitors international developments in medical treatment options for COVID-19. This is done through the National Centre of Infectious Diseases (NCID) and an expert committee. They have developed national treatment guidelines which are constantly updated based on new evidence. They provide guidance to our doctors on the use of evidence-based medical treatment options for COVID-19 patients.,35,68,014-001-095-033-015-068,278
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Our local institutions have also been participating actively in international multi-centre trials investigating novel COVID-19 therapeutics. These trials have generated important data on new COVID-19 treatments such as remdesivir.,36,69,014-001-095-033-015-069,279

Persons who have contracted COVID-19 are clinically assessed for risk factors and scientific papers on the correlations may be published in future.",38,71,014-001-095-033-015-071,281
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Antibody testing is not required after vaccination under Singapore’s National Vaccination Programme and we are actively reviewing the need for vaccine boosters. We are also continually reviewing Singapore’s portfolio of COVID-19 vaccines. We plan to bring in non-mRNA vaccines that are robustly assessed for quality, safety and effectiveness. This should happen before the end of the year, subject to supply and regulatory approval.",39,72,014-001-095-033-015-072,282
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Testing will remain very important, even as we transit to living with COVID-19. Because it is only through testing that we can know if we are infected and do the civic-minded thing in excusing ourselves from work and staying home.",40,73,014-001-095-033-015-073,283
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But we have to make testing simple, accessible and affordable, even more so than now, so that we can all do our part. I believe many Members have done the breathalyser testing just now. So, it is one example of a test that is non-intrusive, simple, easy, accessible and fast.",41,74,014-001-095-033-015-074,284
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Since mid-June, we have progressively rolled out regular Fast and Easy Tests for staff working in higher-risk settings. This includes a network of 16 Quick Test Centres, which we intend to expand further. In response to Ms Joan Pereira’s question, the Quick Test Centres will support small businesses by allowing their staff to walk in and get themselves tested and have their results recorded. At some point, I believe, the Quick Test Centres should also be using breathalyser tests.",42,75,014-001-095-033-015-075,285
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We will continue to work with NEA to deploy wastewater testing across Singapore. Mr Dennis Tan asked about this. Currently, NEA has deployed 270 auto-samplers across about 200 sites. Every site can have a few, two or more auto-samplers. We are increasing this to 500 auto-samplers across 400 sites by end of this year. Wastewater testing is an increasingly strategic resource as we learn to live with COVID-19. Where we place the sites is very important. We can deploy them in areas where we suspect transmission is happening, such as around the markets that are currently affected, or where we know many unvaccinated seniors live.",43,76,014-001-095-033-015-076,286
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,Such testing is non-intrusive and would give us valuable early warning when COVID-19 starts to take hold in a locality; we will know very early. And that will prompt us to take further public health measures in the affected residential estates.,44,77,014-001-095-033-015-077,287

MOH has been publishing monthly safety data updates on our website. It also gives an age breakdown of the affected persons and indeed, the majority are young people. As of 30 June 2021, HSA had received 12 reports of myocarditis and pericarditis occurring in persons after receiving a dose of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine. While there is a small increased risk among those in the younger age groups relative to the baseline rate, the local incidence rate remains low. One of the reported cases is a full-time National Serviceman in the Singapore Armed Forces who is below 30 years old. None of the cases was from the Singapore Police Force and Singapore Civil Defence Force.",45,78,014-001-095-033-015-078,288

2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But remember that with or without vaccination, there is a baseline number of disease cases amongst our population. Since the vast majority of Singaporeans have stepped forward to be vaccinated, there will naturally be numerous incidents which just happen to coincide with vaccinations. Hence, we have to do what is practical and reasonable, which is to have VIFAP applications reviewed by a panel of medical experts, who will consider them against known evidence about the vaccines.",47,80,014-001-095-033-015-080,290

The Sinovac vaccine is called CoronaVac but we always just call it Sinovac. Sinovac is the company; the vaccine is CoronaVac but for simplicity, we just refer to it as the Sinovac vaccine. As at 25 July 2021, about 72,000 persons have received at least one dose of the Sinovac vaccine and about 17,000 persons have received their second doses. Amongst them, 28% are Singapore Citizens and they are mostly young.

As a Government, we need to recognise that our society is diverse, with different segments of the population having different opinions, needs and wants.

With Changi Airport's passenger load at only around 3% of pre-COVID-19 levels – 3%, not 30% – demand in these sectors have plummeted. Some firms have pivoted to adjacent areas. For example, Singapore Airlines is now using some of its passenger planes to operate cargo flights to take advantage of the increase in cargo traffic, while operators in the tourism sector have come up with new and creative products to attract local visitors as foreign tourists have dried up.

We introduced several schemes, such as the Jobs Support Scheme, Jobs Growth Incentive, rental relief and tax rebates. We ensured that firms that ran into cashflow problems could gain access to credit by enhancing our enterprise financing schemes and working with the banks to put in place a moratorium on loan repayment.

COVID-19 has wreaked havoc on almost every single economy in the world, but those which can respond well and take the opportunity to adapt and transform quickly will emerge stronger and move ahead of others.

We need focused efforts. This is why we set up the Emerging Stronger Task force, or EST, at the height of the crisis in May last year, to look at how Singapore should refresh and re-imagine our economic strategies going forward. The EST formed nine Alliances for Action, or AfAs, as a new model of public-private partnership to allow our businesses to move quickly and bounce back stronger.",15,111,014-001-095-033-015-111,321

For example, the AfA on Safe and Innovative Visitor Experiences enabled us to testbed several ideas for safe MICE events, which provided some relief for the MICE sector while also elevating its international profile. The AfA on Supply Chain Digitalisation saw the growing demand for supply chain transparency and resilience and created SGTraDex, which stands for Singapore Trade Data Exchange. As a digital infrastructure, SGTraDex allows businesses to share data with each other in a trusted and safe manner, thereby allowing them to optimise their supply chain flows through Singapore. With more trades coming through Singapore, our position as a key node in the global supply chain is further strengthened.",16,112,014-001-095-033-015-112,322

These include the financial, ICT, biomedical manufacturing and electronics sectors. In particular, the biomedical manufacturing sector expanded significantly by almost 25% last year, while the electronics sector grew around 12.5%. The AfA on medtech product development is another good example of our new partnerships. Recognising the increasing prevalence of infectious and chronic diseases, it identified in-vitro diagnostics as a key sub-sector that we can grow.",17,113,014-001-095-033-015-113,323

We will begin to adjust our Safe Management Measures in stages, while keeping an eye on the number of serious cases. For example, restrictions on social gatherings will ease and we can expect larger dining-in group sizes and lower requirements and higher capacity for various events. We will take a differentiated approach  vaccinated individuals will be able to engage in a wider range of social activities and in larger groups, while those who are unvaccinated will only be able to do so with a negative Pre-Event Test (PET) result.",22,118,014-001-095-033-015-118,328

Sectors, such as tourism, cruise and MICE will also get some relief as capacity limits are progressively raised, although foreign tourists will still take some time to return. Workplace restrictions will also be eased and progressively, more workers can go back to office.

Encourage employees to self-isolate and get themselves tested if they are not feeling well or if they suspect they may have been exposed to COVID-19. Doing so can help detect cases early and limit the extent of disruption to your business. I know of several employers who have made bulk purchases of testing kits, so their staff can easily access them if needed.

As a small and open economy, we simply do not have the luxury of closing ourselves off to the world. Many parts of our economy require a steady flow of people in and out of Singapore, be it workers or visitors.

Practically all social and workplace restrictions can be lifted, although some critical measures, such as mask-wearing and precautions for large events may remain. This means that domestically, infected cases will create much less disruption than they do today and our businesses can largely return to normal operations.",30,126,014-001-095-033-015-126,336

Instead, infected individuals with mild symptoms may be able to recover from home and close contacts will likely just be required to monitor their health without the need for quarantine or self-isolation.

Furthermore, in a mixed population of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons, we are more likely to see large clusters because vaccinated persons can be infected but experience very mild symptoms. Consequently, they may not realise they are infected and inadvertently, become asymptomatic carriers. By the time the cases pop up, days or even weeks would have passed and the infection would have spread to many people.",2,134,014-001-095-033-015-134,344
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Because of these large clusters, we faced a heightened risk of widespread community transmission before we attained adequate vaccine protection. We must remember that the proportion of people with two doses and with two weeks after their second shot was still less than 50%. This was when we moved into Heightened Alert. And we are especially worried about our seniors because there are still over 200,000 seniors aged 60 and above who are not fully vaccinated. If they catch the virus, many would likely become severely ill or even succumb to the infection.",3,135,014-001-095-033-015-135,345
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"That is why, as you heard just now from my Co-Chairs just now, the MTF made the difficult decision to scale back activities and return to Phase Two (Heightened Alert). This will help to slow down transmission in the community and crucially, this will give us time to push up vaccination rates further and protect our seniors.",4,136,014-001-095-033-015-136,346
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),I know the restrictions have caused much inconvenience to everyone. We seek your forbearance and understanding. I hope our explanations will help you understand why we had to reintroduce these painful but necessary measures to protect our seniors.,5,137,014-001-095-033-015-137,347
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),We also know these measures will be difficult for our workers and businesses. This is why MOF announced a new $1.1 billion support package last Friday to cushion the impact. I will elaborate on this in my Statement later this afternoon on the Supplementary Supply Bill and we hope the support measures will help affected workers and businesses tide over the Heightened Alert period.,6,138,014-001-095-033-015-138,348
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"As we bring the current outbreak under control and continue to speed up vaccinations, we will be able to get our reopening plans back on track. The key is to open up at the correct juncture. Some countries have decided to open up fully, even though their vaccination rates are less than ideal. For example, the Netherlands lifted all restrictions when 45% of its population was fully vaccinated. Cases surged ten-fold to an average of 10,000 a day within two weeks. They have since reimposed restrictions. The UK has about 55% of its population fully vaccinated, although its coverage of its seniors is much higher at above 90%. It lifted all restrictions on 19 July, its ""Freedom Day"". Cases have surged to 50,000 a day, more than two-thirds of its peak in the last wave and are likely to rise further. Hospitalisation and death rates are starting to creep up again, almost entirely amongst unvaccinated individuals.",7,139,014-001-095-033-015-139,349
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We are watching what is happening in these countries very closely. What is clear to the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) and our medical advisors is that we should be very careful about lifting restrictions when a significant proportion of our people are still not fully vaccinated, especially our more vulnerable seniors.",8,140,014-001-095-033-015-140,350
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"While other countries may have come to terms with a certain level of COVID-19 cases and even deaths, this is not the choice we want to make in Singapore.	Here, we look out for one another and we take care of each other. We do not want to see large numbers of COVID-19 patients in intensive care, on oxygen supplementation, let alone succumbing to the virus. So, we must give our fellow Singaporeans more time. Today, many younger Singaporeans are still waiting for their second dose of the vaccine. And many of our seniors who had been hesitant about getting vaccinated are now starting to step forward. So, we will see continued improvements in our vaccination rates.",9,141,014-001-095-033-015-141,351
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"At the same time, there is no need to wait for everyone to be vaccinated before we begin to open up.

2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"So, what is our approach? Let me explain.",11,143,014-001-095-033-015-143,353
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We will synchronise our reopening with our vaccination coverage, not just of the overall population, but also amongst our seniors, who are the most vulnerable. And we will do so in a series of controlled steps. So, this is what we can all expect in the weeks ahead.",12,144,014-001-095-033-015-144,354
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"In early August, at the midpoint of the Phase Two (Heightened Alert) period, we plan to review the current set of measures. We will assess the overall infection situation. We will also monitor the status of the infected cases to confirm that the link between infection and hospitalisation has been weakened by the vaccines, like in the chart which Minister Ong showed just now. Importantly, by then, two-thirds of our population would have received two doses and we would have vaccinated about three-quarters of our seniors aged 70 and above. So, if the clusters are under control and hospitalisation rates remain low, we will be able to ease some of the Phase Two (Heightened Alert) measures.",13,145,014-001-095-033-015-145,355
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"But the easing will be differentiated and extended to only vaccinated persons because they are much better protected against the effects of the virus. This means that if you want to attend a large event or a religious service involving more than 100 persons, you have to be fully vaccinated. If you want to go out to dine in a restaurant or work out in a gym, you have to be fully vaccinated.",14,146,014-001-095-033-015-146,356
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"By around early September, we expect to vaccinate about 80% of our population with two doses and we hope to cover a similar proportion of our seniors aged 70 and above. We would then be able to ease the restrictions further, including allowing larger groups to get together, especially if they are fully vaccinated. We would also begin to reopen our borders, especially for vaccinated persons to travel. We will start by establishing travel corridors with countries or regions that have managed COVID-19 well and where the infection is similarly under control. Fully vaccinated persons will then be able to travel to these countries or region without needing to serve the full 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) in a hotel when they return. Depending on the risk level of the country they visit, we will either replace the SHN with a rigorous testing regime or shorten the SHN to seven days at home. This will allow vaccinated persons to travel more freely. Those who are not vaccinated can still travel, but will be subject to the prevailing SHN requirements.",15,147,014-001-095-033-015-147,357
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Beyond that, we will continue with a series of progressive easings. As we do, we must expect cases to rise. Partly because there is still ongoing cryptic transmission in our community, which can easily break out into new clusters with increased activity levels. Also, as we open our borders for people to travel without SHN, we will see more imported cases and infected persons slipping through from time to time. But at that stage, as you heard just now, our main focus would no longer be on daily case numbers. Because the vast majority by then would have been vaccinated and even if they caught the virus, they would be much less likely to become very ill. Instead, our focus will be on the much smaller number of infected persons who need supplementary oxygen or require intensive care.",16,148,014-001-095-033-015-148,358
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"So, at each stage of easing, we will monitor the health outcomes, especially the hospitalisation and ICU cases, closely. We will ensure that these remain acceptable and stable before we proceed to the next step. But if hospitalisation cases, or worse, severe illnesses were to shoot up, we will have to be prepared to slow down, or even pull back.",17,149,014-001-095-033-015-149,359
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"In particular, we have to expect new variants to emerge, which may be more transmissible, more lethal, or more successful at evading the present vaccines. We will find solutions to these variants, especially through booster shots or updated vaccines, which we may need to roll out nationwide. But we must be prepared that the new variants can lead to more severe outbreaks and may well force us to introduce restrictions again from time to time.",18,150,014-001-095-033-015-150,360

If many among our seniors are not vaccinated, we will continue to worry about our hospitalisation and ICU cases, as well as fatalities. So, I make a special plea to all who remain unvaccinated or have not registered to be vaccinated, especially our parents and grandparents  please come forward. And if you cannot get out of the house, we will send a team to your homes for the vaccination.",22,154,014-001-095-033-015-154,364

Basic SMMs like keeping a safe distance from others and wearing a mask can help reduce transmission effectively. So, we must stay disciplined and continue to maintain these practices, even as we transition towards the new normal. For example, we would probably not want to do away completely with our mask requirements. We may consider dispensing with masks when outdoors, but it would still make sense to wear them in an indoor enclosed environment where transmission risks are greater. So, this may well be one of the last rules to go in the new normal.",23,155,014-001-095-033-015-155,365

Since April last year, a multi-agency task force comprising various Government agencies, including the Police, have been coordinating the enforcement of Safe Management and Safe Distancing Measures in public venues, including F&B outlets and massage and spa establishments. They have been doing daily enforcement checks. Where laws were flouted, offenders, both operators and individuals, have been taken to task and cases publicised.

2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"There are a few simple but very effective precautions which we should all incorporate into our daily routines. I have said probably like a million times but I think it is worth repeating. Practise good personal hygiene. If you are not feeling well, stay home. See a doctor and get yourself tested. Do so even if you are vaccinated. Remember what I said earlier at the start that vaccinated persons can get infected and may feel very mild symptoms or even no symptoms. So, if you are feeling unwell – even vaccinated – feeling unwell with very mild symptoms, get yourself tested. If you receive an SMS alert, come forward to be tested as soon as possible and minimise your social interactions until you have a confirmed negative test result.",27,159,014-001-095-033-015-159,369

We are starting with those who live near markets where large clusters have been identified and we will progressively scale up and distribute to everyone in Singapore. As you heard just now, we are also rolling out new methods of testing, be it wastewater surveillance in our estates, or breathalyser tests at our checkpoints. Now, we have the breathalyser test in Parliament too before each Parliamentary session.

In fact, the MTF, as the Minister pointed out, considered the KTV cluster and decided we can manage it without having to impose any additional restrictions. As he has said in his speech, the KTV cluster has been brought under control fairly quickly  tracing, testing, ringfencing the cases. So, we have about five new cases linked to the KTV cluster each day for the past few days. He gave you the figures.

This brings me to the earlier question I posed. Some of them, when you look at the premises, you do question if they can really be F&B, but it requires us to say, flat out, to the operators, ""Regardless of what you say, I am not going to believe you and I am not going to allow you to operate as an F&B"". Agencies are working on the conditions that can be imposed like CCTVs, various other conditions, over and above what is applied to F&B outlets. They will also have to consult with the AGC, ""Can we say no to an operator if we think it might be dodgy, even if the operators undertake to comply with the conditions?"" It is not so straightforward. Once these issues are assessed, the MTF has to decide on whether the opening or reopening can be allowed.",30,199,014-001-095-033-015-199,409

During the period October 2020 to 10 July 2021, the Police conducted 202 operations against pivoted outlets as well as other outlets which were operating illegally. So, this is what I said earlier. Assume we had said no to all pivoting of F&B operations, there would still be places which offer sex and meet-up opportunities; that was always going to happen. So, we had one Police operation every single day on average since October 2020. This, I think, should put to rest any questions about enforcement actions by the Police; one operation every day. That has resulted in the detection of 58 Public Entertainment Act, Liquor Control Act infringements, 595 SMM breaches, 142 arrests for offences under various laws including the Public Entertainment Act, Liquor Control Act, Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, Immigration Act; not all in pivoted places but also completely illegal operations.",31,200,014-001-095-033-015-200,410

As I said to the House just now, there were about 437 pivoted outlets, so roughly 10% have been acting illegally and about 60 other F&B outlets also were in breach.

Basically, only Singaporean residents can come back, some of their relatives and some business travellers.

About one in four citizen marriages were between Singaporeans and non-resident partners. So, it is quite common for Singaporeans to have relationships with non-Singaporeans.

2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The first series of questions pertain to the differentiated regime between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, which is part of the coming to terms and treating COVID-19 as endemic in the community. The query pertains to the negative pre-event tests that unvaccinated individuals will be required to undertake. A few days ago in Israel, the Prime Minister announced that the unvaccinated individual there will pay for the test. I do not believe Minister clarified who pays for that test in Singapore. So, it would be helpful for the Minister to clarify that.",2,223,014-001-095-033-015-223,433

2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"So, the first question is with regard to the enforcement regime at the pivoted establishments, was it a heightened sort of enforcement regime? The Minister mentioned a few numbers – 202 enforcements from October last year to July this year. But was there some specific attention paid on pivoted KTV establishments? I think earlier on, Minister Lawrence Wong spoke in a Facebook post about a cat and mouse game. The Minister referred to that as well. Were additional conditions imposed on certain operators in view of their past record or reputation, so to speak? And in this regard, again, was there a differentiated regime from the enforcement agencies to pay more attention to some of these establishments?",5,226,014-001-095-033-015-226,436
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The Minister spoke of, I think, a total of seven establishments – and I stand corrected if I am wrong – seven establishments that have seen their licences revoked but about 10% of the pivoted KTV establishments have been in breach of regulations. Are the licences for that 10% – which I think will extend to 40 establishments – going to be revoked as well?",6,227,014-001-095-033-015-227,437

2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Let me first address the question on economic reopening. It is still on track and the key is to look at the progress in our vaccination programme, which, as Minister for Health has explained just now, is picking up momentum. But it is important for us to focus a lot more on the vaccination of our senior population which is of a greater concern to all of us. As soon as we are able to reach our vaccination rate of 80% and above around September or October, we will be able to move in a bigger way to reopen the economy.",1,229,014-001-095-033-015-229,439
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"But I also want to point out that we are not likely to have a big bang reopening because it is important for us, as Minister Ong and I have mentioned earlier, to continue to monitor the number of severe cases. If we do have many serious cases, we will have a problem with the capacity of our healthcare system which will then result in a higher mortality rate. So, we need to continue to keep an eye on our number of serious cases and at the same time, make sure that our vaccination rate is high. Then, we will be able to progressively, step-by-step, reopen our economy or open up our borders to allow for travel in and out of Singapore. And as I have mentioned in my speech, these details are still being worked out and we will share more details later on.",2,230,014-001-095-033-015-230,440

2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Lawrence Wong,"  Thank you. The question, I believe, was about who pays for the cost of tests, if the person is unvaccinated, to get into a venue. The thinking is that the rule is that for certain activities, certain settings, we will require vaccinated persons only. And from the Government's side, the rule will be that if the person is not vaccinated, not fully vaccinated, then he will have to produce a confirmed negative test. That is the requirement.",1,232,014-001-095-033-015-232,442

They may want to do it free. They may want to set up an operation. A restaurant might want to do that; a venue operator might want to do that; a MICE event organiser might want to do that, because it says, ""Look, I want to do that to let unvaccinated persons come in."" If not, then, he may well say, ""Look, it is up to the individual. The individual has to go to the clinic, get a test and then show me the result.""",2,233,014-001-095-033-015-233,443

2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr K Shanmugam,"First, on the enforcement regime, I think Mr Singh wanted to know if it is heightened. We can assume that if there was one enforcement action per day, it is quite intense and it has been so from October of last year to July of this year, right from the beginning. This is quite apart from what Safe Distancing Ambassadors and so on do.",2,236,014-001-095-033-015-236,446
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr K Shanmugam,"Second, I think Mr Singh wanted to know if there was a particular focus on pivoted outlets. I gave the breakdown just now. Not all were targeted at pivoted outlets. In fact, there were a number who were not to be operating at all and, in fact, totally illegal operations. And I would say, in terms of seriousness, those are particularly pernicious, in terms of transmission, the kind of activities and so on. And nothing is supposed to be happening in a warehouse. They set up and they do everything. So, those kinds of operations were busted as well. So, a broad range and also F&B operations which were not pivoted operations, just simply reopening. Also, some of them had been in breach. Do not mistake me to think that every single one was, therefore, engaging in what we might consider to be shady activities. Sometimes, there were breaches also. But we needed to target a broad range.",3,237,014-001-095-033-015-237,447
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr K Shanmugam,"Third, I think Mr Singh wanted to know – seven have been closed, but I pointed out that 10% were in breach, about 40-odd out of the 400 which had pivoted. And are they going to be closed? I assume Mr Singh is not asking for the closing down of every operation as long as there is any breach. There is a framework. Depending on the nature of the breach, there will be a penalty. The penalty is transparent and the penalty will be imposed according to the kind of breach that has been committed. And I think most people will know that there is also a point system for breaches which lead to closure. Of course, got egregious breaches, there will be closure. But I would not ascribe to Mr Singh the suggestion that Police now should get even tougher and just close everyone down as long as there is one breach.",4,238,014-001-095-033-015-238,448
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr K Shanmugam,"The last point I think was whether warnings given by the public were taken seriously. I do not do the operations obviously, but I think most Members will know how, in general, the Police intel system is expected to work. Police have their own intelligence framework, their own ground framework and public tip-offs. A lot of crimes are solved by public tip-offs and they are important, they are taken seriously and I assume that goes into the assessment framework on what operations to conduct.",5,239,014-001-095-033-015-239,449
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"  There is a last question by Mr Pritam Singh on vaccine supplies. Supplies continue to be in shortage throughout the world. Many developing countries are still trying to secure supplies and, in the earlier stage of the pandemic, we, too, were short of supplies. But, fortunately, we had negotiated advance purchase agreements (APAs) with major suppliers in the early stage of the pandemic. And, lately, we were able to bring forward and confirm some of the deliveries. So, as of now, for the past month or two, we have not had a supply problem. Our constraint now is we need more people, especially our seniors, to come forward and get vaccinated.",1,240,014-001-095-033-015-240,450

As time goes on, the testing system will also evolve. For example, in time to come, if you have gotten a negative test result, you may be able to attend multiple events and multiple premises.

2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"The first is stemming from a worry about discrimination on treatment between those who have been vaccinated versus those who are unable to and those who do not wish to be vaccinated and the treatment that they receive. On the one hand, I empathise and hear the calls of those saying, ""What is the point of being vaccinated if I am still faced with certain restrictions or why are we being penalised?"" But at the same time, I know full well the impact of some of those who are unvaccinated for various medical reasons, in particular, our seniors and the social impact of the isolation not being able to be involved in activities.",2,245,014-001-095-033-015-245,455

I would not call it discrimination because there are good public health reasons to differentiate the treatment between those who are vaccinated and not vaccinated. The differentiation helps protect those who are not vaccinated. The Member asked about whether TraceTogether app can indicate vaccination status. I believe it already does. Mine does; it says that I am vaccinated. You can check yours.",2,252,014-001-095-033-015-252,462
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Second is that children or seniors who, because of medical conditions, are not allowed to be vaccinated, whether they get left out. Earlier on, when we came out with the ""two-five rule"", one of the criticisms is that it was so confusing. And indeed, the confusion arises because of the exemptions we were trying to give. For example, in a group of five, all vaccinated, but you allow up to two children below 12 who cannot get vaccinated, but can join part of the group. So, I think, when we do our mid-term review, we will also take into account these provisions. And as for those who cannot be vaccinated or unvaccinated for some reason, but want to join such a group, we had earlier also allowed them to take a PET (Pre-event Test). If you are negative, you can join the group. This is something we will consider as we do our mid-term review.",3,253,014-001-095-033-015-253,463

How did the virus get into the Jurong Fishery Port? As I mentioned earlier, phylogenetic study shows that there is likely to be multiple points of entry because there are slight genetic differences in the virus and the infections across the cluster. We will continue to see if we can trace the sources of the infections. But as of now, it does not help us to suppress the cluster.

To date, 76% of workers at JFP are fully vaccinated, while 86% have received at least one dose of vaccine. Unfortunately, COVID-19 managed to breakthrough these defences, with many cases detected at JFP over the past month. The cases further spread to the markets and hawker centres through the stallholders who had visited JFP. In order to break the chains of transmission, MOH made a difficult, but necessary decision to close JFP for two weeks from 17 to 31 July with all 684 workers issued Quarantine Orders.",11,269,014-001-095-033-015-269,479

This meant a higher propensity for workers to adjust their masks or take them off momentarily. Second, the workers could have taken off their masks while they take their breaks, smoking breaks, for example, and socialise in close proximity. Third, JFP, being a marketplace, meant that the workers and traders mix freely throughout the facility. It is just like the market that we are used to, shoppers going around, traders going around and sometimes, between stallholders they mix as well as they move stocks from one to another. Some contactless delivery measures were not strictly followed. Finally, we are investigating the possibility of fomite transmission in JFP.",13,271,014-001-095-033-015-271,481

So, we look around and there is a qualitative assessment, our SDAs are out there, enforcement officers are out there and if we see that, potentially, in this particular industry, in this particular work site, SMMs are not followed, then that raises the alarm bells and we will want to take a closer look at that.

I think the school protocols have, fortunately, been very tight. Up to now, in the recent outbreaks, we have not had school-based transmission. We have had students who have been infected from their home, from family members, but not yet school-based transmission. We hope that can continue and that is, in part, because our schools have been very stringent in keeping and complying with these protocols. But still, beyond just having safe management measures, we would certainly look at putting in place a testing regime, especially when there are more convenient methods of testing which can be scaled up.",5,297,014-001-095-033-015-297,507

For all those who have taken the Sinovac vaccine, only 10% are Singaporean seniors above 60 years old. So, the great majority of Singaporean seniors actually still prefer the mRNA vaccine.

They asked why the F&B sector seems to be bearing the brunt of each of the heightened measures. So, can I ask the Minister why did we reverse on the 19 July decision to have fully vaccinated five-person dine-n?

Therefore, the risk profile was significantly different from when we first started planning for the ""two-five rule"" framework. Therefore, we had to make a very painful decision. I must share with you that we deliberated at length on this issue. Of course, one option was to proceed with it, come hell or high water. But the risk was that you may see a significant number of seniors being infected and because they would still be unvaccinated, they would still be at risk of severe outcome and even mortality.",2,310,014-001-095-033-015-310,520

But you must also remember that those who go to the restaurants and are vaccinated may still be infected and bring the virus back home to the families where there are seniors who are unvaccinated.

And there is a lot of interaction in restaurants and F&B outlets. The most critical difference is that their activities are mask-off, as customers have to remove their masks when they eat and drink. Therefore, it is one of the very high-risk settings and we have to be extra careful and exercise additional caution.

This lower efficacy rate has been known for some time. Why did MOH not make this known clearer that they will not be giving the same recognition to the Sinovac vaccine as the mRNA vaccines yet, for the purpose of differentiated measures? Because this could have blunted the demand for the vaccine, which was mentioned earlier, and convinced more people to get the mRNA vaccines.",3,317,014-001-095-033-015-317,527

I would say generally, even in the recent episode, we have seen that the systems are in place.

Yes, obviously, there are. But by and large, it has still been very effective and we want to make it even more effective, which is why for markets and hawker centres, previously, we had not put SafeEntry check-in requirements for all markets and hawker centres; because we all know it is very difficult.

2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"  The answer is yes. I think the quick test centres, in time to come, are likely to be almost a national infrastructure for living with endemic COVID-19. I can imagine buildings and employers requiring that their employees should be tested once every 14 days or seven days before coming to work as a precaution, as part of living with COVID-19. And the easy way to do it, either you buy a self-test kit from the pharmacy or you walk into one of these quick test centres, do a self-swab or do a breathalyser test.",1,349,014-001-095-033-015-349,559

Right now, it is five days, 10.00 am to 5.00 pm, I think, because many of the F&B outlets find that weekends are not suitable for them.

So, it only assumes an 8%-9% vaccine hesitancy share of the population. Elsewhere, it has been demonstrated that at far lower coverage rates, populations have seen a point of inflection where there is resistance. I guess the question is  how would we get this coverage to this 80% that, I agree, would certainly be welcomed?",2,353,014-001-095-033-015-353,563
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"  The basis of projection is because we watch the number every day. I do. Right now, those who have taken the first jab, it is already 76% and that is over the whole population, including those under 12. And if you break it down by age bands, it is well over 80% – 85% to 88% – except for the most senior group, age above 70, which is at 76%.",1,354,014-001-095-033-015-354,564

I think when the task force announced that we are going to release the Sinovac vaccine to the people, many rejoiced, they were very happy about it. But this rejoicing was short-lived after it was announced that the Sinovac vaccine – once you are vaccinated – is not considered as part of the national vaccination programme. I also understand that there are overseas Singaporeans who are vaccinated with AstraZeneca or other vaccines and I think MOH is prepared to accept them if they do a serology test.

I am very happy to hear that there is enough vaccine for all of us and, by September, we probably will hit about 80%. I read in the papers, our neighbour, Johor Bahru, has about 15% vaccination as of last month and I think Batam's was 23%.

Rather than doing serology tests – and amongst our experts, there are also different interpretations of serology tests – I think the easiest thing is to go back to what I have said just now. As of 5 July, Sinovac has submitted all the required data for us to do a proper evaluation under our PSAR framework. So, let HSA do its work. It is trying to do it as fast as it can.

So, beyond immediate easing and reopening, when we are well and truly into a new normal of endemic COVID-19; in this new normal, as Minister Ong Ye Kung has noted, we will have reached a high level of vaccination and, therefore, COVID-19 resilience in the population and the need for differentiation between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons would be less.

2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"So, to take this a little bit further, in the new normal, there is still a possibility that we get a major flare-up in infections from time to time. And in such a scenario, the few hundreds of thousands or half a million persons or so who remain unvaccinated will be the ones at greatest risk of severe illness and therefore, at greatest risk of loading our healthcare system.",3,366,014-001-095-033-015-366,576
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"And so, in such a scenario, I would like to ask the MTF how might we tame the flare-up and would the MTF then consider in such a scenario a sharper differentiation, albeit a transient or interim one in SMMs between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons so that we can protect the unvaccinated but yet not cause a major disruption to normal life for the vast majority like we now have in Phase Two (Heightened Alert)?",4,367,014-001-095-033-015-367,577
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"And more to the point, do we think we still need to pull back – to use Minister Lawrence Wong's words – pull back sharply as a population from time to time in the new normal or can we finally expect to see the last of Phase Two (Heightened Alert)?",5,368,014-001-095-033-015-368,578
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Lawrence Wong,"  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have tried to give some clarity on what we can expect in the weeks ahead. Mr Xie would like clarity in the months forward. Unfortunately, with the current situation being so fluid and uncertain, it is very hard. We do not have a crystal ball. That is why, beyond, I said early August, mid-term of the Phase Two (Heightened Alert), we have one move. When we get to about 80% coverage, we make another move. Maybe in September and beyond that, we will consider sequential moves.",1,369,014-001-095-033-015-369,579
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Lawrence Wong,"But each time we do so, we do it step-by-step and we do it in a controlled manner, not a big bang. And whenever we make one move to ease, we monitor health outcomes very closely, precisely for the concerns that Mr Xie has highlighted, that there will still be unvaccinated persons and we are concerned that when we make one step to open, cases go up. We have to watch the health outcomes and the hospitalisation and ICU cases.",2,370,014-001-095-033-015-370,580
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Lawrence Wong,"If these were to spike, then as I have said, we might either have to slow down on the next step of reopening or, in the very worst case, if indeed, a lot of unvaccinated persons and a lot of elderly turn up sick in the hospitals, then we may really have to pull back, as I have mentioned. The worst case in my mind would be when a new variant strikes. No one knows exactly when this will happen and what what sort of new variants we will see. But the risk is not trivial. And if a new variant emerges down the road that is much more transmissible or worse, lethal and more resistant to the current batch of vaccines, then it is almost like you are dealing with a new virus frankly. Therefore, the defences have all got to go up again.",3,371,014-001-095-033-015-371,581
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Lawrence Wong,"So, while we are embarking on this journey of reopening, let us understand that there are still risks, there are still uncertainties ahead and, therefore, we are taking this controlled step forward, remain alert, remain vigilant and continue to be flexible and adaptable in adjusting our posture, based on the latest assessment of risks and the external environment and how the pandemic proceeds.",4,372,014-001-095-033-015-372,582
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Deputy Speaker,  I will take two more clarifications before closing the debate. Mr Leon Perera.,1,373,014-001-095-033-015-373,583
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Just one clarification for the Minister for Health. There will be some individuals who have both doses and who still have very low resistance to the virus due to them being immuno-compromised for genetic reasons or to reasons due to having certain risk factors.",1,374,014-001-095-033-015-374,584
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),Is the Government actively looking at – and this can relate to the Parliamentary Question that I have filed – is the Government actively looking at giving a third jab to such individuals if the science actually supports that that will help them to raise their resistance to the vaccine? And I understand that the US Centres for Disease Control is actively looking at this question right now.,2,375,014-001-095-033-015-375,585
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"  If I am not wrong, the US has not come to a conclusion and neither have we. We are studying this actively whether we need a third dose as a booster, when and what kind of strategy – whether you use back mRNA or use a heterologous strategy. So, these are all being studied. And when the Expert Committee has made a decision, we will make the information public.",1,376,014-001-095-033-015-376,586

2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. Just a change to direct my question to Minister Shanmugam. I had earlier filed a Parliamentary Question for a later Sitting but I thank the Minister for answering it earlier.",1,378,014-001-095-033-015-378,588
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"I just have a follow-up question which is  given that there were rules to disallow hostessing and yet there was blatant disregard for the rules and now, with the spotlight on these KTVs or pivoted outlets, I am just wondering whether there is a risk that more of these vice activities may then be driven underground to other settings.",2,379,014-001-095-033-015-379,589
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Therefore, how will the surveillance and enforcement be stepped up to control this? I know the Minister had addressed this in quite some detail but I am just wondering how will the surveillance and enforcement be stepped up further, given the current possibility and especially in areas, such as industrial spaces, where perhaps office or factory spaces could be used for parties at night, based on some anecdotal feedback that we have heard?",3,380,014-001-095-033-015-380,590
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr K Shanmugam,  I thank Ms Tin for that question.,1,381,014-001-095-033-015-381,591
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr K Shanmugam,"I think we have to rightly focus on the people who are the cause of the spread, people who operate illegally and the people who patronise. But, before the pandemic, what was our framework? Singapore never made prostitution illegal because we knew that countries which had tried and for thousands of years people have tried, it is not going to work. So, you need to be realistic about what is doable and what is not doable. Pimping is illegal. Prostitution was neither illegal then nor is it now, except, I suppose, when there are safe distancing measures.",2,382,014-001-095-033-015-382,592
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr K Shanmugam,"When we allowed the nightlife outlets, pubs, bars, KTVs, those who wanted to pivot, what was our understanding of the situation? Supposing we had said no to all of them, there would have been a great deal of loss of jobs. But does that mean that, immediately, all dodgy activities would have stopped? Ms Tin is right. Precisely, this issue, it would have gone underground much more and it would have been very difficult to trace.",3,383,014-001-095-033-015-383,593
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, pivoting is not the issue. The issue is that there is money to be made in making available the services and there will always be people, because there is a huge demand, regardless of the rules and there is – I would not say unlimited supply but there is some supply. There will always be arbitraging opportunities to make money. That is why flats, industrial spaces, warehouses – you would have seen it in the newspapers – they even organised illegal KTV operations.",4,384,014-001-095-033-015-384,594
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, if we remove the two issues, it is not that one is not connected to the other. The pivoting of some operators is not connected to illegal activities. They go on and, by definition because of our rules, if all these activities are ""underground"", in the sense that they are not in the open, then we have to go and use our intelligence to find and deal with them. Some are in these outlets; some are in outlets that are not obvious. We have to keep continuing at it and whatever rules we come up with, this is not going to stop. It is just a question of whether it is more or less of the activities.",5,385,014-001-095-033-015-385,595
2021-07-26,Fifth Update on Whole-of-Government Responses to COVID-19,014-001-095-033-015,Mr K Shanmugam,"It puts a heavy onus on the regulatory authorities. We can urge everyone to be responsible. But as you saw from the example I gave, immediately after the unilateral opening was closed, there were many girlfriends standing up with Singapore sponsors with a variety of reasons and this will go on. We just have to try and deal with them.",6,386,014-001-095-033-015-386,596

2021-07-26,Support Measures for Phase Two (Heightened Alert),014-001-095-033-016,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"I recognise that businesses in the affected sectors have been working very hard to adapt to the changing regulations and are deeply disappointed by this turn of events. Last week, Minister Gan Kim Yong and I spoke with representatives from the Singapore Business Federation and several trade associations from the F&B and retail sectors. We have also received feedback from several business owners.",2,2,014-001-095-033-016-002,605

2021-07-26,Support Measures for Phase Two (Heightened Alert),014-001-095-033-016,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"In response to the concerns and feedback of businesses, we are providing higher wage support this round to further mitigate the impact of protracted safe management restrictions and uncertainties. For sectors that are required to close or suspend most of their activities, we are providing 60% JSS support, up from 50% previously. This will benefit the F&B, sports, performing arts and arts education sectors.",7,7,014-001-095-033-016-007,610
2021-07-26,Support Measures for Phase Two (Heightened Alert),014-001-095-033-016,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We also enhanced support to 40%, up from 30% previously, for sectors that are significantly affected by the restrictions. These include footfall-dependent sectors such as retail, museums, art galleries, historical sites, cinema operators, affected personal care services and family entertainment centres. The tourism sector will also receive 40% support as their revenues are likely to be impacted by the restrictions. This will benefit attractions, hotels, cruise and regional ferry operators, MICE organisers and travel agents.",8,8,014-001-095-033-016-008,611

2021-07-26,Support Measures for Phase Two (Heightened Alert),014-001-095-033-016,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),We will also help Small and Medium Enterprises and eligible non-profit organisations with cash flow by providing relief for rental costs. We will do this through an additional four weeks of rental waiver for qualifying tenants of Government-owned commercial properties and an additional two weeks of rental relief cash payout for qualifying tenant-occupiers and owner-occupiers of privately-owned commercial properties under the Rental Support Scheme.,10,10,014-001-095-033-016-010,613
2021-07-26,Support Measures for Phase Two (Heightened Alert),014-001-095-033-016,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),Many commercial tenants have asked the Government to intervene and mandate their landlords to extend rental relief. The Government has set out the principles before. Our starting point is always the sanctity of contract; we do not lightly intervene. But we are prepared to intervene in specific situations and in a carefully scoped manner. We decided to do so last year when we introduced emergency measures during the circuit breaker.,11,11,014-001-095-033-016-011,614
2021-07-26,Support Measures for Phase Two (Heightened Alert),014-001-095-033-016,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"In the last Heightened Alert, we did not require private landlords to extend rental relief. Instead, we encouraged landlords to do their part to match the Government relief. However, many tenants, especially those in the affected F&B and retail sectors, have told us that not all landlords were forthcoming in providing such rental support.",12,12,014-001-095-033-016-012,615
2021-07-26,Support Measures for Phase Two (Heightened Alert),014-001-095-033-016,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"This time, in light of the difficulties faced by many businesses, the Government intends to require landlords to provide a matching two-week rental support to their tenants. We recognise that not all landlords are in the same financial situation; some may have difficulty sharing the burden with their tenants. So, for landlords which are genuinely facing hardship, we will put in place a process to take their circumstances into consideration. More details on this measure will be announced by MinLaw in due course.",13,13,014-001-095-033-016-013,616

We recognise that our hawkers and market stallholders are affected disproportionately this time round, with many of them facing loss of earnings. Those operating in markets with active transmission have been required to close. Those who can operate have also been affected by reduced footfall due to public reservations about visiting markets and adjoining hawker centres. This is why we have introduced a new Market and Hawker Centre Relief Fund, which provides a one-off cash assistance of $500 per stallholder who operates in Government hawker centres and markets.",14,14,014-001-095-033-016-014,617

2021-07-26,Support Measures for Phase Two (Heightened Alert),014-001-095-033-016,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"First, we have worked with agencies to identify $0.9 billion of one-off under-utilisation in operating and development expenditures. These are due to delays brought about by COVID-19, so, they are one-off in nature. They include postponement and cancellation of activities in schools due to COVID-19 and construction project delays. Of course, these delayed expenditures will still need to be incurred in the future, once we recover from COVID-19.",21,21,014-001-095-033-016-021,624

2021-07-26,Support Measures for Phase Two (Heightened Alert),014-001-095-033-016,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Given that we are funding this support package via reallocation, we expect the overall fiscal position for FY2021 to remain unchanged with an overall deficit of $11 billion or 2.2% of GDP.",24,24,014-001-095-033-016-024,627
2021-07-26,Support Measures for Phase Two (Heightened Alert),014-001-095-033-016,The Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We do not expect this latest period of Heightened Alert to derail our economic recovery.

This small increase was likely contributed by increased business costs due to Malaysia’s recent Enhanced Movement Control Orders (EMCO) across the country, as well as seasonal weather that reduced crop supply.",1,2,014-001-095-033-021-002,741

The Government also continues to assist Singapore families in various ways. For example, MSF’s Social Service Offices (SSOs) provide ComCare assistance to low-income households to support their daily living expenses such as food, clothing, transportation and communications. From time to time, the Government also introduces one-off support measures to help Singaporeans with their household expenses during periods of economic uncertainty, such as the Budget 2020 Grocery Vouchers Scheme.",2,3,014-001-095-033-021-003,742

For example, it works with community partners such as the Community Emergency and Engagement Committees (C2Es) to organise community engagement events, which provide hands-on training on the use of fire extinguishers and disseminate fire safety educational materials. After a fire incident, SCDF partners the C2Es to conduct door-to-door engagements with residents of the affected blocks to share fire safety tips and assuage possible concerns.

In 2020, over 99% of debris from demolition was recycled for further use in the Built Environment sector. BCA’s Green Mark scheme also awards points to developments that make use of resource-efficient building designs and conserve existing buildings onsite.

For repeat offenders or those with psychiatric issues, NParks partners Town Councils, Municipal Services Office (MSO), PA, and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) to find out their motivations and to discourage them from continuing to feed wildlife. NParks also partners the AIC to offer nature-based activities to these feeders. For example, since January 2020, NParks has engaged repeat feeders of wild birds and offered them activities such as community gardening and bird-watching to discourage them from illegal bird-feeding. In addition, the AIC offers mental health assistance to repeat offenders with underlying conditions, where appropriate.

Tenants who rent HDB flats or rooms on the open market are not subject to the EIP, as their stays are typically more temporary in nature. That said, to prevent the formation of foreigner enclaves, HDB introduced the ""Non-Citizen Quota for Renting Out of Flat"" in 2014 to cap the number of flats that can be wholly rented out to non-Malaysian non-citizens within each block and neighbourhood.

This happens across all races, including Chinese sellers who are affected by the non-Chinese EIP limits. That said, we do receive more appeals from sellers from the minority races who find it more difficult to sell their flats at their desired price. This is because Chinese buyers form a larger proportion of the market and the impact on individual non-Chinese sellers is therefore larger when the Chinese EIP limits are reached.",3,8,014-001-095-033-041-008,838
2021-07-26,Data on HDB Flat Transactions Affected by Ethnic Integration Policy and Help for Flat Sellers or Buyers Impacted by Policy,014-001-095-033-041,Mr Desmond Lee,"However, it is difficult to size the exact impact of the EIP on financial outcomes. The selling price of a flat could be affected by many factors, including the location, storey height and the physical condition of the flat. Timing also matters, as market sentiments change over time. Similarly, the price of a flat at the point of purchase also depends on multiple factors. In particular, if a flat had been purchased on the resale market and was affected by the EIP limits at the point of purchase, the current seller could have bought the flat at a lower price, a positive financial impact from the EIP at that point. As such, the financial gains would vary for each transaction and for reasons other than and even due to the EIP.",4,9,014-001-095-033-041-009,839
2021-07-26,Data on HDB Flat Transactions Affected by Ethnic Integration Policy and Help for Flat Sellers or Buyers Impacted by Policy,014-001-095-033-041,Mr Desmond Lee,"As I shared in Parliament earlier this month, we are studying the situation carefully, including what more we can do to help affected sellers. We appreciate the suggestions raised by Mr Xie Yao Quan, Mr Zhulkarnain and Dr Tan Wu Meng, and will consider them in our review. But let me say that any potential measure must apply to all races and should be targeted at addressing the unintended effects of the EIP. For example, it might not be appropriate to tie the resale levy to the EIP as they serve different policy objectives. The resale levy is intended to reduce the size of the second housing subsidy from HDB and hence, applies to those who buy a second subsidised flat from HDB. Not all EIP-constrained flat sellers will buy a second subsidised flat and be liable for a resale levy in the first place.",5,10,014-001-095-033-041-010,840

For instance, HDB may give the household more time to sell their flat, or even waive the EIP limit if there are exceptional circumstances. We will keep working to smoothen the rough edges of the policy and seek Singaporeans' continued support for the EIP and the vital role it plays in fostering racial harmony and understanding.",6,11,014-001-095-033-041-011,841

We accord all Singaporean male officers salary increments for their duration of FTNS at the point of their first appointment into the Civil Service. This is to bring them on par with their peers in the same age cohort who did not serve FTNS. Once officers enter the Civil Service, their salary and career progression are based on individual merit and performance and not differentiated by gender.",1,2,014-001-095-033-042-002,843

Within the Marine Park, some conservation and research sites are not open to the public and can only be accessed by authorised individuals for scientific research, habitat restoration and species recovery activities.",2,3,014-001-095-033-058-003,934

For example, on St John’s Island, NParks works with community stakeholders, such as the Friends of Marine Park, to organise outreach activities on marine conservation including seminars, workshops, guided tours, and citizen science programmes. NParks has also installed onsite storyboards and conducts monthly guided walks to educate the public on the rich history and biodiversity of the island.",3,4,014-001-095-033-058-004,935

For example, the National University of Singapore, supported by the National Heritage Board (NHB), conducted a two-year research and documentation project, which concluded last year, on the Southern Islands’ cultural and natural heritage. The project included an exhibition and public tours, which helped give Singaporeans a deeper understanding of the history and heritage of the Southern Islands. In addition, NHB has included the traditional pilgrimage to Kusu Island in the national inventory of Singapore’s intangible cultural heritage.",4,5,014-001-095-033-058-005,936

The Singapore Government is closely monitoring the impact of these restrictions on our imports of essential supplies. Thus far, the flow of goods and supplies from our neighbouring countries remains stable. Overall merchandise trade between Singapore and our Southeast Asian neighbours also continues to grow. In the second quarter of 2021, total merchandise trade between Singapore and Southeast Asian countries was S$68.9 billion, an increase of 30.3% compared to the same period last year.",1,2,014-001-095-033-059-002,938

Domestically, Singapore’s economic recovery remains on track. Based on advance estimates, GDP expanded by 14.3% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2021, albeit from a low base. GDP is likely to continue to recover gradually over the course of the year in tandem with the economic recovery globally and in the region. For the full year, MTI expects GDP growth to come in at between 4% and 6%, compared to the 5.4% contraction in 2020.",2,3,014-001-095-033-059-003,939

It is this ecosystem that supports local jobs.

The mainstay of supply is HDB flats pending demolition, such as vacated SERS flats, that are not immediately needed for redevelopment. As at June 2021, HDB has about 840 rental flats available under PPHS. The majority of these are occupied and tenants usually stay for two years or longer.",2,3,014-001-095-033-092-003,1089

Delays in BTO completion have also slowed down the return of PPHS flats to HDB. At the same time, the demand for PPHS flats has increased, likely due to delays in BTO completion, working from home and competition for open market rental from others who need to rent flats.",3,4,014-001-095-033-092-004,1090

This behaviour can lead to a variety of concerns, including disamenities to immediate neighbours. The Municipal Services Office (MSO) leads a multi-agency workgroup to coordinate hoarding cases. The workgroup includes HDB, NEA, NParks, Animal and Veterinary Services (AVS), MSF, People's Association (PA), Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), Singapore Police Force (SPF) and Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) so that enforcement, social, community, health and medical interventions can all be considered in an effort to address the issue holistically and in a coordinated manner.",1,2,014-001-095-033-093-002,1095

When public feedback is received, cases are assessed and prioritised based on whether there is threat to public health and safety. For severe cases, regulatory agencies can already enter the home to make an assessment of the severity of the existing hoarding situation. For example, NEA for vector or mosquito issues, or SCDF if the materials hoarded comprise particularly flammable materials, such as petroleum or petroleum products. Likewise, SCDF works with the Town Councils and Management Corporation Strata Titles (MCSTs) to remove hoarding in the common areas, which increase fire safety risks by obstructing fire evacuation routes.",2,3,014-001-095-033-093-003,1096

There are thus no clinically proven medical treatments that could fully address hoarding behaviour and would apply to all hoarders. The interventions for each case will have to differ depending on the hoarder's underlying motivations and available support, such as from family members and community (for example, neighbours and social service organisations).",3,4,014-001-095-033-093-004,1097

Therefore, we will need strong support from the hoarder’s family and community. In many of the successful interventions, family members and neighbours have worked closely with agencies and grassroots leaders to encourage and assist the hoarders such that their behaviour does not recur. Premature mandated interventions may be not conducive to successful resolution as trust amongst the stakeholders may be eroded. MSO and the agencies involved will continue to review the need for more legislative powers, manpower and resources in tackling this issue.",4,5,014-001-095-033-093-005,1098

Since 2003, all foreigners working in Singapore have not been allowed to contribute to CPF or receive CPF contributions from employers. The CPF system is designed to support Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents in their retirement, housing and healthcare needs.

Some of the reports were misunderstandings that were resolved following clarifications with the complainants. For example, there were cases of employers and employees misinterpreting the work-from-home requirement to mean that no employees could return to the workplace, when employees whose work is of a nature that cannot be performed from home are allowed to do so.",1,2,014-001-095-033-095-002,1103

Our goal is not to find fault with employers, or to penalise them unnecessarily. Doing so will put further stress on the business and may even affect the livelihood of the employees. Most instances of non-compliance are minor, such as employees improperly wearing masks, or employers not enforcing the use of workplace SafeEntry check-ins. In such cases, MOM will advise the companies to rectify shortcomings. In a small minority of cases (66 of the reports received), MOM imposed a composition fine. These include cases where safe distancing was not observed at the workplace and where employees were back at the workplace at their employer’s instruction, even though their work could be done from home.",2,3,014-001-095-033-095-003,1104

This is due mainly to the suspension of workplace activities in the second and third quarters of 2020 to manage the COVID-19 outbreak. Notwithstanding, the unsafe practices detected remain largely unchanged, with the most common being unguarded openings and open sides, poor maintenance of heavy machinery such as excavators, boom lifts and forklifts and insufficient safeguards when operating machinery.",1,2,014-001-095-033-096-002,1107
