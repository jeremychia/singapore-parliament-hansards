And so, Members are still required to do an ART self-test before coming to Parliament House on Sitting days.

2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song,asked the Minister for Manpower whether there are plans to review the Employment Pass (EP) scheme to introduce a new dependency ratio ceiling for the bottom half of income earners among EP holders to encourage employers to enhance their Singaporean workforce by hiring and training more Singaporean talent and transferring skills from their foreign employees to the local workforce.,1,6,014-001-095-069-002-006,12
2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,Mr Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many companies have been placed under the Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices’ watchlist in 2021 due to possible breaches of the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF); (b) among those on the watchlist, how many have been found to have breached the FCF and debarred from hiring foreign workers and renewing their foreign workers’ work passes; and (c) how are employment agencies that breach the FCF dealt with.",1,7,014-001-095-069-002-007,13

2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,Dr Tan See Leng,"  Members of the House, I delivered a Ministerial Statement last month on “Strengthening Singapore’s Position as a Global Hub for Talent”. In the Statement, I outlined how we intend to strengthen Singapore’s position as a global hub for talent and addressed questions around the enhancement of our work pass framework, including the introduction of the Overseas Networks & Expertise (ONE) Pass.",1,11,014-001-095-069-002-011,17
2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,Dr Tan See Leng,"Members have subsequently filed a number of Parliamentary Questions on three related issues. First, on how we ensure a complementary foreign workforce. Second, on our concurrent efforts to develop our local talent pipeline. And last but not least, on our efforts to safeguard fair consideration. I am taking them together, so that we can address the issues more holistically. I will address questions which are more technical in nature on specific policies separately.",2,12,014-001-095-069-002-012,18
2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,Dr Tan See Leng,"First and foremost, ensuring a complementary foreign workforce. Members in this House generally acknowledge the need to attract top talent, as per the intent of the ONE Pass. Some Members have, however, raised questions on our broader foreign workforce policy.",3,13,014-001-095-069-002-013,19
2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,Dr Tan See Leng,"At the Employment Pass (EP) level, we focus on ensuring that the EP holders are of good quality. And we do not impose quotas. To answer Mr Gerald Giam’s question on whether there are plans to review the EP framework to introduce a quota for the bottom half of income earners among EP holders, we have explained our rationale before – doing so will restrict our ability to compete and hold our companies back.",4,14,014-001-095-069-002-014,20
2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,Dr Tan See Leng,"Our emphasis on quality was reinforced when MOM announced significant adjustments to our EP framework at this year’s Committee of Supply debate. First, to benchmark the EP qualifying salary to the top one-third of our local Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians (PMET) workforce. And second, to introduce a new points-based Complementarity Assessment Framework (COMPASS) from 1 September 2023 to holistically evaluate EP applications for complementarity. Companies whose candidates cannot meet the EP qualifying salary or pass COMPASS will have to apply for an S Pass instead, where they will be subject to a quota.",5,15,014-001-095-069-002-015,21
2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,Dr Tan See Leng,"This is a neater solution than what Mr Giam is suggesting. Compared to his suggestion where some EP holders are subjected to a quota while others are not, our current approach has the merit of keeping the positioning and criteria of each pass type clear, and overall work pass framework simpler for businesses.",6,16,014-001-095-069-002-016,22
2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,Dr Tan See Leng,Being open and connected and bringing in complementary global talent have helped to grow the overall pie for Singapore and more good job opportunities for locals.,7,17,014-001-095-069-002-017,23
2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,Dr Tan See Leng,"Ms Jessica Tan asked if there is data to show that Singaporeans are succeeding in getting quality jobs in key sectors. At the same time, Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked about the number of EP holders in the Information and Communications sector, compared to other sectors. The Information and Communications sector has been a fast-growing one and is a sector that is facing talent shortages worldwide. In Singapore and elsewhere, employers have had to tap into the global marketplace for skills in shortages. In 2021, the ICT sector accounts for one-fifth of our EP stock. This has increased from one-sixth in 2016, thus reflecting the growing digital needs of our economy. The growth of the Information and Communications sector has also resulted in creation of more jobs for our locals – in the same timeframe, we saw strong growth in the number of local PMETs by 34,400. Median local wages in the sector also continue to increase. Therefore, we can see quite clearly that it is not a zero-sum game.",8,18,014-001-095-069-002-018,24
2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,Dr Tan See Leng,"At the macro level, the data is also encouraging. There are more locals in higher-skilled PMET jobs. The proportion of resident workers in PMET jobs increased from 55% in 2016 to 62% in 2021. Across the board, local workers have experienced sustained wage growth. The median income of full-time employed residents has grown from $4,100 to $4,700 over the same period, an increase of 2.1% per annum in real terms. We have also seen improved job quality and better wages at the lower end, with the income of full-time employed residents at the 20th percentile increasing 2.7% per annum in real terms over the same period.",9,19,014-001-095-069-002-019,25
2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,Dr Tan See Leng,"Mr Leong Mun Wai also filed a question in a subsequent Sitting specifically on local postgraduates, a group that is very likely to be taking up or even creating these high-quality roles. Their average unemployment rate has remained lower than that of all locals over the past five years.",10,20,014-001-095-069-002-020,26
2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,Dr Tan See Leng,"We have managed to create good employment outcomes because we continue to be an attractive place for companies to do business. By combining and complementing local and foreign expertise, we can attract more investments and create many more good job and career choices for Singaporeans. Conversely, if companies do not have access to the complementary foreign manpower that they need, they may exit Singapore and take the jobs they create for Singaporeans with them. When it comes to foreign workforce policies, the way to advance is to strike a very careful and delicate balance.",11,21,014-001-095-069-002-021,27
2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,Dr Tan See Leng,"Next, on developing our local talent pool and workforce. Local talent development already happens organically in tandem with economic growth. As businesses expand their investments here, they will need to find manpower to fill various roles and invest in training and upgrading their workers. By working in leading firms and alongside global talent, our local workers will also gain exposure to new ideas and best practices from around the world.",12,22,014-001-095-069-002-022,28
2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,Dr Tan See Leng,"The Government and tripartite partners help to catalyse this process. We work with industry stakeholders to chart out transformation plans across 23 sectors through the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs), which include strategies to prepare our workers for higher value-added jobs in each sector.",13,23,014-001-095-069-002-023,29
2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,Dr Tan See Leng,"We have also put in place a whole eco-system of programmes and schemes which businesses can tap on to prepare their workers for jobs of the future. For instance, we recommend that companies work with NTUC to set up Company Training Committees (CTCs) to help drive business transformation and training plans – the Government has set aside a $70 million budget for the NTUC CTC grant. Employers can also tap on subsidised industry-relevant training courses and reskilling programmes for mid-career workers. This includes Workforce Singapore (WSG)’s Career Conversion Programmes (CCPs).",14,24,014-001-095-069-002-024,30
2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,Dr Tan See Leng,"Ms Mariam Jaafar1 filed a question for a later Sitting on how work experience and other certifications are considered aside from formal academic qualifications in eligibility requirements for CCPs. For some CCPs, academic requirements are put in place to ensure that the trainee is able to cope with the training, particularly where the training is very technical in nature. Applicants who do not meet the academic requirements may still be accepted into the programme if they have relevant alternative qualifications or work experience.",15,25,014-001-095-069-002-025,31
2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,Dr Tan See Leng,"Ms Jessica Tan also asked about our initiatives to bring back top overseas Singaporean talent. Overseas Singaporeans, who have developed the ability to thrive in a global environment or who have gained industry-relevant experience and built extensive networks, can make significant contributions to our economy and pass on their knowledge to other Singaporean talent. Fundamentally, strengthening Singapore’s position as a global hub for talent which is brimming with exciting opportunities is self-reinforcing – it will help to bring back overseas Singaporeans who are keen to contribute and to be a part of this ecosystem. The Government actively engages overseas Singaporeans to keep them connected to home, so that they can make an informed decision about whether and when to return to Singapore. The Singapore Global Network (SGN) within the Economic Development Board (EDB) plays a key role in broadening and deepening our overseas Singaporean network through digital engagement, as well as partnerships with private, public and community organisations to deliver engagement initiatives, such as networking and community events. These engagements also allow overseas Singaporeans to serve as our valuable connectors and ambassadors in overseas markets, helping to spread Singapore’s good reputation. For returning Singaporeans, SGN and other agencies offer a variety of online resources to facilitate a smooth transition, including information on education, working and living, as well as relocating back home to Singapore. For example, MOE’s website contains information about school admissions for returning Singaporean children.",16,26,014-001-095-069-002-026,32
2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,Dr Tan See Leng,"Lastly, on fair consideration. There is no place for discrimination in Singapore. MOM does not and will not tolerate unfair hiring practices, and employers who do not give locals a fair chance will face stiff penalties. The Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) sets out requirements for all employers to consider local workers fairly for job opportunities. Work is now underway to enshrine this in legislation.",17,27,014-001-095-069-002-027,33
2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,,"Mr Yip Hon Weng asked about the number of companies placed on the FCF watchlist. Firms are placed on the FCF watchlist if they have an exceptionally high share of foreign PMETs compared to their industry peers, or a high concentration of a single foreign nationality source. But, Members of the House, let me reiterate this. Firms placed on the FCF watchlist have not flouted any rules. Instead, what the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) does is to engage these companies to help them improve their workforce profiles. Since 2016, MOM has engaged a total of more than 1,700 employers under FCF.",1,28,014-001-095-069-002-028,34
2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,,"One other limb of FCF is the job advertising requirement. Employers must first advertise on MyCareersFuture (MCF) and fairly consider all candidates, before submitting an EP or S Pass application. Mr Louis Chua asked whether companies need to notify MOM on the outcome of a job posting when it is subsequently delisted or when the role is filled. We do not require companies to do so, just like how they also do not need to do so for other job portals. We are conscious of the fact that we should not add administrative burden and make it onerous for employers to use MCF.",2,29,014-001-095-069-002-029,35
2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,,"While the number of cases of discriminatory practices is small, MOM will continue to remain vigilant. Besides investigating complaints lodged with TAFEP, we will also use data analytics to identify suspicious cases for further investigation. And where employers are found to be discriminatory, MOM will not hesitate to take action against such employers. In response to Mr Louis Chua and Mr Yip Hon Weng's questions, from 2017 to 2021, MOM took enforcement actions against approximately 300 companies. The regulatory actions included issuance of warning and being barred from hiring or renewing foreign workers.",3,30,014-001-095-069-002-030,36
2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,,"Ms Hazel Poa also asked whether MOM intends to impose personal responsibility on human resource (HR) professionals in Singapore to comply with all manpower rules and regulations. I would like to remind Ms Poa that hiring decisions are not made by HR professionals alone. Senior management as well as line managers are also involved in these hiring decisions. Today, MOM can take action against culpable individuals and decision-makers for non-compliance of MOM's rules and regulations. This includes HR professionals as well as business leaders. Employers, business leaders and HR professionals all play an important role in ensuring that their companies' employment practices are fair and that they comply with regulations and the Tripartite Guidelines. All employers in Singapore must comply with not just the letter but with the spirit of our laws and regulations on fair hiring, and adopt good HR practices. The responsibility placed on employers as well as decision makers to uphold workplace fairness is also being discussed by the Tripartite Committee, which is deliberating the scope and design of workplace fairness legislation. Beyond enforcement, we must also enable and equip HR professionals to better support their companies.",4,31,014-001-095-069-002-031,37
2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,,"Mr Speaker, Sir, in summary, we have a three-pronged strategy to support good employment outcomes  first, to safeguard the complementarity of our foreign workforce; second, to invest in developing our local workforce; and third, to ensure fair consideration for locals. All our Government policies, all of our schemes as well as programmes, work together to achieve one goal – to create opportunities for locals, at all and every level of the workforce. I thank Members for their questions and I assure them that MOM will continue to update our suite of policies regularly and in line with this objective.",5,32,014-001-095-069-002-032,38

2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister for his comprehensive answer but I do have two supplementary questions. One is with regards to the quality of jobs. Minister shared about the make-up of Singaporeans and residents and our workers in Singapore, in terms of the PMET jobs. Could he also share if there is any data, in that same vein, for leadership roles as the development has happened of Singaporeans taking up professional leadership roles in these sectors.",1,34,014-001-095-069-002-034,40
2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"The other supplementary question I have – it is very heartening to hear about the outreach on SGN and keeping in contact with Singaporeans overseas. Specifically, with regards to top talent for the key sectors that we are focusing on, what specific actions or initiatives are being done to engage and attract top talent back to Singapore to be able to fill those key positions, as we look at attracting foreign talents, and specific support to their families in terms of transitioning, especially if they have non-Singaporeans as spouses?",2,35,014-001-095-069-002-035,41
2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,Dr Tan See Leng,"  I thank Ms Jessica Tan for her supplementary questions. On the leadership roles, we do not have the data available at hand today. Perhaps, if Ms Tan could file a Parliamentary Question (PQ), we will try and get some of those data. But, if you look at the proxy, if we use the $30,000 salary criteria of the ONE pass mentioned at the last Parliamentary Sitting, and given the fact that if you use the proportion of about 7,000 to 8,000 current EP holders who are at that level or above, a significant majority who have gone above that level are our Singaporeans. So, perhaps, that would give you some form of a broad macro indicator, if you take that as a proxy. But, like I said, it may not necessarily be an accurate proxy.",1,36,014-001-095-069-002-036,42

While I agree with Ms Jessica Tan that returning top Singaporean talent can make significant contributions to our economy back home, where they are in today, in many of the tier one cities all over the world, they can also serve as valuable connectors and advocates in many of these overseas markets while they continue to gain the networks, the expertise and the industry relevant experiences abroad. Many of them actually chose to carry on staying for longer periods because they have got other ties, work commitments, maybe friends and schools.",2,37,014-001-095-069-002-037,43
2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,Dr Tan See Leng,"The initiatives that we have started, I could give you a few examples. One, is the Singapore Financial Forum (SGFF). It is co-organised by the Institute of Banking and Finance (IBF), SGN and MAS. We held the inaugural forum in May 2022. It was a two-day event featuring insights from industry leaders on key growth areas and career opportunities in Singapore's financial centre. The people who attended felt that it was a very good forum for them to communicate and also for them to consider relocating back home, and included fireside chat with industry leaders on their overseas experiences and relocation journeys as well.",3,38,014-001-095-069-002-038,44

This seeks to attract outstanding overseas based Singaporean research leaders back to Singapore to take up leadership positions in our Universities and our research institutions.

2022-10-03,Efforts to Grow Manpower Talent for Key Sectors and to Groom Local Pipeline,014-001-095-069-002,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"  Sir, since the Ministry is not imposing any quotas on Employment Pass holders, would it consider fixed-term EPs which cannot be renewed once they expire? This way employers can be incentivised to hire and train Singaporeans to fill those positions when the EP expires and there will be more knowledge and skills transferred to Singaporeans. This is a proposal that the Member for Aljunied GRC Leon Perera raised in October 2020.",1,41,014-001-095-069-002-041,47

Can MOM tighten the COMPASS framework to require the candidate to obtain at least 10 points for each of the four foundational criteria and a minimum of 50 points overall? This will ensure that companies give consideration to all the criteria and ensure a more level playing field for Singaporean PMETs during the hiring process.",2,42,014-001-095-069-002-042,48

First, on the Employment Pass, we have earlier on said that there is no fixed-term EP. In fact, the EP holders for these companies, they do not enjoy an automatic renewal for these EP holders. There is a certain validity and some of them are on a two-year term, some are on a one-year term, and subject to companies renewing them, subject to other criteria, these EPs are not automatically renewed.

I refer to the Minister's earlier reply, specifically where he mentioned that companies on the Fair Consideration Framework have not actually flouted any rules. In view of the Ministry's newly-introduced Complementarity Assessment Framework (COMPASS), where diversity is listed as a firm related attribute in considering EP applicants, how significant in the Minister's opinion, would this new criterion be in reducing the number of companies on the FCF watchlist over time?",1,54,014-001-095-069-002-054,60

Our sense today is that, in the run-up to implementing COMPASS, and as we engaged more firms, we get feedback that this is a good framework which helps to differentiate our workforce. It also allows us to review from time to time, how we can be more responsive to the type of jobs and the type of talent our country and our economy needs.

I only have one supplementary question. I note form the Minister's response on the use of data analytics. So, just wondering if Minister can share with us in terms of the data points that are being collected from companies which make an EP application, to show that they have failed to source for a local candidate after the 14-day or 28-day period, despite their best efforts.

Does the Government have plans to study more deeply the impact of socioeconomic status as well as housing type on the excess mortality risks from COVID-19?,1,20,014-001-095-069-006-020,152
2022-10-03,Implications of Study on Excess Mortality During COVID-19 Pandemic,014-001-095-069-006,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"  I thank the Member for that suggestion. It is a good one. We have the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. Maybe that is something they can look into but, so far, we have not compiled those numbers. But if we look at the literature and our own experience, the two main drivers of excess deaths have been, first, are you vaccinated? Second, your age. And I think that will continue to be the case. Notwithstanding, it is an interesting line of enquiry which our researchers will definitely look at.",1,21,014-001-095-069-006-021,153

2022-10-03,Implications of Study on Excess Mortality During COVID-19 Pandemic,014-001-095-069-006,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"  On vaccination eligibility, the question is actually the other way around. We would very much want people to be vaccinated but, usually, it is the resident who comes forward to say ""I am not eligible. I have got eczema, I have this, I have that"" and then some are not so valid medically, others we have to take a closer look, especially if they have some adverse reaction after their first shot and they then may become ineligible. And that is a medical indication which we will have to respect, notwithstanding the fact that we bring in different types of vaccines now with different technological platforms and, hopefully, they will be able to take one of them.",1,26,014-001-095-069-006-026,158
2022-10-03,Implications of Study on Excess Mortality During COVID-19 Pandemic,014-001-095-069-006,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Second, how do we further increase the rate of vaccinations? We have to keep on explaining why it is beneficial to vaccinate. We have to get the momentum. Vaccination begets vaccination. When we see more of our friends and relatives vaccinated, we also, notwithstanding some hesitancy, will go vaccinated. So, we have to bring vaccinations to the community, which we are still doing through our mobile teams. And also for those who are not mobile and are stuck at home, we will go to their homes to provide the vaccination.",2,27,014-001-095-069-006-027,159

Today, vaccination is pretty much all covered. Whoever is holding out probably is very hesitant, unable to change their mind or, indeed, have medical contraindications and you cannot vaccinate them.",3,28,014-001-095-069-006-028,160
2022-10-03,Implications of Study on Excess Mortality During COVID-19 Pandemic,014-001-095-069-006,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Moving forward, it is more the booster rate and I think we should move to a stage where we stop counting the number of boosters, such as booster one, two, three and so on, but move to a concept where we really live with the virus closer to how we live with influenza. Every year, when there is a season, take an influenza vaccination that will protect you throughout the year and I think we need to. As we gather more data, as we have the shipments in and operations are ready, we will announce the details and move to a new mode of vaccinating the population.",4,29,014-001-095-069-006-029,161

As of the first week of September, average weekly passenger traffic at Changi Airport has recovered to above 60% of pre-COVID-19 levels and it has held at that level steadily.

We will also be commencing departure operations in the southern wing of Terminal 2 on 11 October, in addition to arrivals which had commenced on 29 May. With this, Changi Airport will have the physical capacity to accommodate up to 70 million passengers per annum, which is about 100% of the passenger traffic levels that we had pre-COVID-19. This also represents about 80% of Changi’s pre-COVID-19 capacity itself. In other words, we have used the intervening time to enhance Changi's capacity as well.",4,8,014-001-095-069-007-008,169

This has been an ongoing process since early this year. The air transport sector workforce has recovered to about 80% of pre-COVID-19 levels in the first half of the year. Aviation stakeholders aim to hire another 4,000 workers between September and the end of this year. Cumulatively, this will bring us to about 90% of our pre-COVID-19 workforce.

Given that Changi Airport is our strategic asset and has still many labour-intensive components, such as baggage handling, catering and training, what lessons can be learnt and incorporated in the future Terminal 5 (T5) design and possible retrofitting of the current infrastructure? And how can we provide more support for the airport workers, such as those represented by Singapore Airport Terminal Services Workers Union (SATSWU) to upskill and improve productivity so that we can continue to improve on the renowned service of Changi Airport?",1,12,014-001-095-069-007-012,173

As with all other sectors in Singapore, it is a priority because ultimately, by upskilling the workers, we enhance their productivity, enhance the competitiveness of the companies and the larger aviation sector and, of course, enable them to have good jobs with good wages. So, it is a virtuous cycle, something that we are continually working on.",2,14,014-001-095-069-007-014,175
2022-10-03,Ensuring Manpower and Service Level Adequacy with Reopening of Terminals at Changi Airport,014-001-095-069-007,Mr S Iswaran,The Member's first question was on areas such as baggage handling and what lessons we have learnt that can be incorporated into the T5 design.,3,15,014-001-095-069-007-015,176
2022-10-03,Ensuring Manpower and Service Level Adequacy with Reopening of Terminals at Changi Airport,014-001-095-069-007,Mr S Iswaran,"The last two years, as Members would know, we had paused in the development of T5 because the trajectory of air travel recovery was uncertain in light of COVID-19. As was recently announced by the Prime Minister at the National Day Rally, we have restarted the design and process for T5. And the key lessons we have learnt include how we can modularise airport operations in order to enhance their resilience – in this case, our civilian airport – to such pandemic-type challenges. Because, as I think all of us would well appreciate, airports are designed for convergence of streams of passengers. And yet, when you are in a pandemic-type situation, the objective is really to separate the streams as much as we can according to their risk categorisation.",4,16,014-001-095-069-007-016,177
2022-10-03,Ensuring Manpower and Service Level Adequacy with Reopening of Terminals at Changi Airport,014-001-095-069-007,Mr S Iswaran,"That inverts the logic of airport operations and  is something that has to be factored into the design early, not just in terms of processes, but in terms of actual physical design. So, modularity and how it can help combine with processes to enhance the resilience of our airport in the face of possible pandemics in the future is one aspect.",5,17,014-001-095-069-007-017,178
2022-10-03,Ensuring Manpower and Service Level Adequacy with Reopening of Terminals at Changi Airport,014-001-095-069-007,Mr S Iswaran,"Another aspect has been sustainability and how we can focus on ensuring that T5, but more generally all of Changi, can really lead the way as a sustainable air hub. And this is why CAAS is now working on developing a blueprint for a sustainable air hub in Singapore.",6,18,014-001-095-069-007-018,179
2022-10-03,Ensuring Manpower and Service Level Adequacy with Reopening of Terminals at Changi Airport,014-001-095-069-007,Mr S Iswaran,"And finally, on specific areas like baggage handling which the Member raised, this is actually one of the key challenges and this is not unique to Changi. Because all over the world, baggage handling is one of the most manpower-intensive aspects of airport operations. How we are able to automate this is a key part of the work that is going on. As I think Members can well appreciate, this is not something you can decide on a standalone basis because it is not only one airport doing this. Whatever we do has to be ultimately coordinated with airlines, aircraft design and what happens in other airports. So, it is a general effort that is being undertaken to see how greater automation can be brought into the handling of baggage at airports. In fact, I was in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Assembly earlier last week and this was one of the topics that was discussed by several of the aviation ministers. So, it is an ongoing effort and CAAS is investing in a lot of innovation work in that regard.",7,19,014-001-095-069-007-019,180

And that also is in relation to one of my Parliamentary Questions (PQs), which is, what would be the assumptions underlying the projection that the number of flights will rise to 80% and above?",2,22,014-001-095-069-007-022,183

2022-10-03,Ensuring Manpower and Service Level Adequacy with Reopening of Terminals at Changi Airport,014-001-095-069-007,Mr S Iswaran,"On overshooting capacity, I think what the Member meant by that is whether we expect that we will go beyond what we think is the expected volume. To some extent, there is predictability and the reason why there is predictability is because airlines file their flight plans with the airport slots authority, that is, with Changi Airport. In this case, for the next cycle which is really from October through to March next year, it is called the Northern Winter schedule.",2,25,014-001-095-069-007-025,186

Of course, there may be variations to that for a variety of reasons, whether it is disruptions and so on. But by and large, given what has been presented to our airport, we think that the estimations that we have are within the ballpark. Whether it will exactly turn out the way we expect, I think there are many unknowns, as all of us will appreciate.

China is a significant source for us. Pre-COVID-19, China would have accounted for about 20% of our tourism visitor arrivals.

I think we know that there is just a general shortage of manpower and, in particular, for aviation especially on the air side, it is not just about recruitment but we have to make sure that they are trained, and they are able to deliver safely for themselves and for all other users of the aviation services.

It was at about 35,000. At the end of last year, we had about 25,000. In the first half of this year, I think about 4,000 were recruited and the aim is really to get another 4,000 workers to join the aviation workforce.

Digitalisation and sustainability are going to be key drivers for the aviation industry. For this, we will need specific skill sets. So, we have to retrain those who are already in the industry and that is happening as we speak. At the same time, we also may need specific types of talent to come on board to augment what we already have.

The assessors' role for such applications is to determine whether a Notification for Relief (NFR) was validly issued to enable a party to seek relief under Part 2 and Part 8. For construction and supply contracts, the service of a valid NFR would entitle the affected party to two categories of relief  (i) a moratorium against legal and enforcement action, and (ii) a statutory defence against damages for delays or breaches which are materially caused by COVID-19.

Since October of last year, Singapore's exchange rate relative to its main trading partners has appreciated by almost 5%.

Singaporeans everywhere are already feeling the pinch from increases in the cost of living, hurting from things they were previously able to comfortably afford.

The largest increase of $2.9 billion was due to higher stamp duties, which due to, in IRAS' own words, ""a buoyant property market"" and ""an increase in property transactions"". Notably, the take from GST, also increased by 22% even without any increase in the rate of GST, telling me observers also expect the tax revenues in the upcoming fiscal year are likely to increase yet further.

Nobody expects a continuous stream of payout from the Government once inflation returns to historical norms. Moreover, there is the prospect of even more extraordinary revenues in the forthcoming months. This Government had previously indicated that it would be unwise to plan for new revenues arising from the OECD-led BEPS collaboration to roll out a minimum corporate tax.

In June, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong announced a $1.5 billion support package, which still leaves $7.2 billion on the table. One approach is to postpone the GST tax increases. Even if we accept that we cannot, in Deputy Prime Minister Wong's own words, ""keep delaying the GST tax increase given our pressing revenue needs"", we can at least try to forestall the increase for another two years.

This amendment corrects a longstanding, yet glaring discord between BTs and other related trust structures, notably real estate investments trusts (REITs), where only a simple majority was required for removing the manager. Given the enormous power vested into a trustee manager within the BT structure, this change will re-enfranchise the average unit holder.

One could credibly make an argument that directors of a firm are integral to its viability as a going concern and hence deserving of such support from the business entity. But the case is much harder to make for a trust. After all, the very design of a trust is already one step removed from the principles to allow business decisions to be rendered sufficiently independently of the directors.",7,47,014-001-095-069-015-047,506

To be fair, this strikes me as a fairly pedestrian change that is likely to be invaluable for operational purposes. Still, I wish to seek the assurance of the Minister, that the MAS will only exercise this power to wind up BTs judiciously. In particular, it should already be clear with exercising this clause, that the trust is already clear defunct, rather than an exercise of this power as a means of regulation.

Well, as industry observers are well aware, a BT is not constrained, in terms of the amount of leverage they are able to take on. In contrast, REITs are only able to be geared up to 50%. This introduces a potential concern, where what are essentially REITs are registering as a BT to avoid the prudential stipulations related in part to excess leverage. Indeed, while some BTs, do explicitly state that their practices more closely imitate REIT guidelines, such as restraining the amount of leverage that they take on, these are merely self-regulating assurances which are not limited by the force of law.",11,51,014-001-095-069-015-051,510

This vehicle offers greater flexibility in extracting value from cashflow generating assets over how distributions may be made and in structuring of assets under development. Undoubtedly, there are major reasons for their comparative popularity. I also recognise that the benefits of BT from the perspective of our position as an international financial centre.

As Members of this House are undoubtedly aware, business entities, whether taking the form of companies or a trust, typically adhere to the rigours of maximising profits and shareholder value.

If BTs increasingly become a favourite structure for managing large business asset holdings, would the additional distance between unit holders and management afforded by the BT and by design, inadvertently undermine the ability of workers to engage in negotiations with management? Would we see greater willingness by BT-managed businesses to fire employees at the first whiff of a downturn?

If this enhanced interventionism is paired with more flagrant disregard for non-pecuniary objectives – perhaps, because of differences in the investment horizon – then I fear that directed action by the trustee managers or their proxies on corporate decisions may induce more cut-throat behaviour by these firms in favour of capital, to the detriment of labour.",17,57,014-001-095-069-015-057,516

In fact, REITs are required to distribute least 90% of their distributable income to enjoy this tax transparency, where BTs do not enjoy any tax transparency and, hence, are not subject to similar requirements. So, there are differences between REITs, as well as BTs, and that is why although they are structurally similar, some of the provisions, we have to regard them as separate as well.",12,89,014-001-095-069-015-089,548

REITs are investment funds which are obviously subjected to investment guidelines and are intended to specifically hold income-producing properties. The business trusts are not investment funds. They are business structures which can hold the wide range of assets. Assoc Prof Jamus Lim mentioned many of the 18 that he raised earlier on. So, they do hold a wide range of assets but they are not limited to real estate, although many that Assoc Prof Jamus Lim raised appear to be linked to real estate, but they can also operate active businesses.",13,90,014-001-095-069-015-090,549

However, similar loan repayment terms are not required to be included for defending against regulatory actions, consistent with the comparatively less severe nature of regulatory actions versus Court proceedings. The difference in treatment also follows from equivalent provisions in the Companies Act and it can also be found in the UK Companies Act as well.",17,94,014-001-095-069-015-094,553

The provision does not provide for apportionment. The general position is that the loan will need to be repaid according to the required terms, as long as the director is convicted or judgment is made against the director, and that the conviction or judgment is final.",19,96,014-001-095-069-015-096,555

He asked what would constitute ""reasonable steps"" for the purpose of a trustee-managers' discharge of their obligations to identify controllers of a BT. MAS intends to issue guidelines on this, similar to the guidelines issued by ACRA, under the Companies Act. Under ACRA's guidance, a company is regarded as having taken ""reasonable steps"" if it sends out a notice at least annually to each member and each director of the company, unless the person has already provided it with the requisite information.",20,97,014-001-095-069-015-097,556

In fact, apart from Singapore, there are few other jurisdictions where business trusts are also used as corporate vehicles. Australia, Hong Kong, Canada have business vehicles quite similar to our BTs. But, of course, our own business trust regime has its own legal framework with very clear rules that are specifically tailored to the features of our business trusts. In fact, it was developed to be as close to a company as possible, as they are intended to be an alternative structure to companies so that they have that flexibility. For example, Malaysia's BT regime is also quite similar to that in Singapore. There are also other jurisdictions – Australia, Hong Kong and Canada, for example – that have different structures, but they have their own regulatory regimes suited to their own ecosystem.",32,109,014-001-095-069-015-109,568

2022-10-03,Accountants (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-069-016,The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance),"Today, ACRA is empowered under the Accountants Act to review individual PAs' audit work for selected clients. I will refer to these as engagement inspections. For these engagement inspections, ACRA evaluates whether a PA has complied with the prescribed requirements when auditing financial statements during the audit process. The Public Accountants Oversight Committee (PAOC) adjudicates and decides on remedial actions and sanctions for PAs who fail the engagement inspections.",6,7,014-001-095-069-016-007,585

These QC inspections check if the AEs have the internal processes and procedures relating to leadership responsibilities for quality, independence, ethics, client acceptance, human resources, performance and monitoring. However, the QC inspections are currently not formalised under the Accountants Act. This means that when the QC lapses are found, ACRA is unable to mandate remediation or take actions against the AEs.",7,8,014-001-095-069-016-008,586

The proposed amendments will allow ACRA to conduct inspections on all AEs and compel AEs to remediate lapses uncovered during the QC inspections, including imposing sanctions where necessary. This will bring Singapore's regulatory regime in line with the practices of other audit regulators in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia.",8,9,014-001-095-069-016-009,587

This ensures that AEs deliver consistently high-quality audit. If an issue is identified, AEs can make across-the-board improvements that would benefit all engagements. Mandated QC inspections will complement the existing engagement inspections and make for a better regulatory regime for audit work.

Such designated activities include, among others, buying and selling of real estate; managing of client money, securities or other assets; organisation of contributions for the creation or management of companies; and buying and selling of business entities.

2022-10-03,Accountants (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-069-016,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"I support the Bill as it enhances the audit framework.

2022-10-03,Accountants (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-069-016,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Firstly, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, what is the estimated cost of compliance, given the new regulatory measures and increased inspections?",3,53,014-001-095-069-016-053,631
2022-10-03,Accountants (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-069-016,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"I agree with the risk-based approach to focus quality control inspections on AEs with higher risk and public interest clients. This would provide a balance between increased regulatory costs and meeting the objective of the said Bill. However, the burden on these higher-risk AEs in terms of financial costs and time would still be increased. These AEs will need to dedicate time and manpower towards compliance and prepare for the audits.",4,54,014-001-095-069-016-054,632
2022-10-03,Accountants (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-069-016,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Would the Government provide subsidies as part of the easing-in period to help PAs and AEs to adapt to the changes?

2022-10-03,Accountants (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-069-016,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Secondly, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as we improve the framework for the accounting industry, investment in training of accounting talents is also necessary to raise the overall audit quality in Singapore. PAs and AEs would have to keep up with the new regulatory regimes. The best way to do so would be through professional upskilling.",6,56,014-001-095-069-016-056,634

2022-10-03,Accountants (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-069-016,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Thirdly, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have to stay abreast with the trend of companies moving into the realm of cryptocurrency and even NFTs in recent years. It is important that we do a meticulous audit of such companies or companies that may have invested in these new monetary realms. It is important to note that cryptocurrencies have been used to launder money.",8,58,014-001-095-069-016-058,636
2022-10-03,Accountants (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-069-016,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"As cryptocurrencies and NFTs are emerging technologies and complex, they may be poorly understood.

2022-10-03,Accountants (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-069-016,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"To ensure audit firms deliver consistently high audit quality, I agree with having stringent deterrent measures and penalties. Be that as it may, this should not be at the expense of impacting the long-term attractiveness of the profession.

The financial landscape for existing regulated activities has changed and continues to change rapidly, requiring a constant relook at the rules.",14,64,014-001-095-069-016-064,642
2022-10-03,Accountants (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-069-016,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Take, for example, some of the key emerging technologies that are disrupting the sector, namely, AI and analytics, intelligent automation, blockchain, cybersecurity and cloud computing. Many of these could boost auditing quality, allowing the collection and analysis of broader industry datasets which may previously be less accessible. Conversely, some of these technologies, being less established or in the hands of someone less technologically-inclined, may give rise to problems in audit quality.",15,65,014-001-095-069-016-065,643

2022-10-03,Accountants (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-069-016,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Singapore is an established international financial centre, but competition for this global position is rife. We always want to project ourselves further, to be a leading global financial centre.

2022-10-03,Accountants (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-069-016,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My first clarification has to do with the refusal to undergo practice monitoring programme and review by public accountants and accounting entities. I have two questions.,2,76,014-001-095-069-016-076,654
2022-10-03,Accountants (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-069-016,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Firstly, under the new sections 38A and 38K, public accountants and accounting entities may be suspended for up to two years if they refuse without a reasonable excuse to undergo a practice monitoring programme or a review respectively. Can the Minister provide examples to explain what constitutes a reasonable excuse under these sections?",3,77,014-001-095-069-016-077,655
2022-10-03,Accountants (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-069-016,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Secondly, section 38K(6) lists the scenarios where a public entity is deemed to refuse to undergo a review. These include refusing to allow a practice reviewer to inspect documents or refusing entry to premises. These actions are clearly made by individuals who act on their own accord, possibly in defiance of their accounting entity's instructions. Can the Minister clarify what the Oversight Committee or the Courts should consider in determining whether acts of refusal by individuals are attributable to an accounting entity?",4,78,014-001-095-069-016-078,656
2022-10-03,Accountants (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-069-016,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My second clarification has to do with the practice review of a public accountant set out in sections 37 and 38. Based on the report of a practice reviewer, the Practice Monitoring Sub-committee provides recommendations and the Oversight Committee makes orders. Neither authority seems to have the remit to conduct further investigations.",5,79,014-001-095-069-016-079,657
2022-10-03,Accountants (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-069-016,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Can the Minister share whether and how the Sub-committee and the Committee can conduct further investigations so they can make a more informed decision? Is there any opportunity for a public accountant to present their side of the story to the Sub-committee or Committee before an order is served? After all, once an order is served, it could be 30 or more days before the General Division of the High Court responds to the public accountant's appeal. Even if successfully appealed, an order may still have serious professional consequences for the public accountant. So, it is important to ensure the right decision is made the first time.",6,80,014-001-095-069-016-080,658
2022-10-03,Accountants (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-069-016,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My third clarification has to do with appeals against the orders of the Oversight Committee.

2022-10-03,Accountants (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-069-016,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"To ensure that there is meaningful access to review by the Court, can the Minister share if the Oversight Committee will, as a matter of course, provide a written decision on the basis for its orders? This will enable the public accountant or accounting entity in question to consider whether any appeal is necessary. This is important, given that the costs involved in pursuing an appeal at the High Court can be significant.",8,82,014-001-095-069-016-082,660

Mr Don Wee and Mr Yip Hon Weng asked how the Government can help the profession, especially the Small- and Medium-sized audit Practices (SMPs) with the training and implementation of the new regulatory regime. Mr Yip also raised the issue of cost of compliance.",3,91,014-001-095-069-016-091,669
2022-10-03,Accountants (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-069-016,Ms Indranee Rajah,"To be clear, the Quality Control (QC) standards that the Accounting Entities (AE) need to comply with are not new. All AEs would thus have to maintain a system of QC to ensure compliance with professional standards and the relevant regulatory requirements. As I mentioned, for AEs that audit public interest entities (PIEs) such as listed companies, ACRA has already been conducting QC inspections on them. If AEs have been duly complying with the requirements and putting in place the necessary QC, ACRA's QC inspections should just serve as a check to ensure that the QC and systems put in place by the AEs are indeed adequate.",4,92,014-001-095-069-016-092,670
2022-10-03,Accountants (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-069-016,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Also, based on the nature and circumstances of the AE and the engagements performed by the AE, some of the requirements set out in our QC standards may not be applicable to certain smaller AEs. For example, larger AEs with international networks would need to look into policies relating to network resources requirements, but SMPs with no international network would not have to meet such requirements.",5,93,014-001-095-069-016-093,671

There will be a greater focus on inspecting AEs that audit higher risk PIE clients. AEs that audit lower-risk non-PIEs will be inspected less frequently. In addition, AEs that performed well in their previous inspections will be subjected to less frequent inspections compared to AEs with more issues identified during inspections. Such a risk-tiered approach is meant to keep the compliance burden manageable.",6,94,014-001-095-069-016-094,672

The remedial actions may include completion of training programmes and/or subjecting certain audit engagements to further reviews before finalising the audit reports. If areas of non-compliance are not too severe, orders imposed on the PAs and AEs will primarily be remedial in nature. However, for very severe and recurring non-compliances, sanctions may be necessary to protect public interest and send a strong deterrent message in addition to the remedial orders. There are existing processes and an escalation framework for the PAOC to manage non-compliances with its orders. This will continue to be the case.",12,100,014-001-095-069-016-100,678

It is still necessary to finance these hard-to-abate sectors because they are important parts of the economy, and alternative technologies to reduce emissions significantly have yet to be commercially viable or to achieve scale.

2022-10-03,Impact of Applicants Rejecting Chance to Choose BTO Flats,014-001-095-069-052,Mr Desmond Lee,"HDB therefore encourages all flat applicants to select a flat when they have the chance to do so. Those who choose not to book a flat will be issued a non-selection count. First-timer families who accumulate two non-selection counts will have their subsequent flat applications moved to the second-timer category for a year. Second-timer families who accumulate two non-selection counts will not be able to participate in subsequent sales exercises for a year. Additionally, first-timer families who have been unsuccessful in two or more attempts for a BTO flat in the non-mature estates (NMEs) receive an additional ballot chance for each subsequent NME BTO application. Virtually all first-timer families who apply for NME BTO flats are successful within their first three tries. However, the count of unsuccessful NME BTO applications will be reset to zero if a first-timer family chooses not to book a flat when offered a chance to do so.",3,4,014-001-095-069-052-004,954

Non-recyclable items such as soft toys and clothing are also mistakenly placed in recycling bins. To improve household recycling behaviour, NEA launched the inaugural Recycle Right Campaign in 2019. In January 2022, NEA introduced a new recycling mascot, Bloobin, as well as educational and user-friendly content to encourage the community to cultivate right recycling habits. A search engine has also been developed to help residents search for and identify items that can be recycled (www.go.gov.sg/recycleright).

2022-10-03,Guidelines for Cruise Ship Industry's Practice of Overbooking,014-001-095-069-063,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"  Overbooking is a common practice in the global cruise industry. Cruise operators allow some bookings above their capacity in anticipation of cancellations and no shows. This allows cruise operators to make more sailing date options available for consumers, avoiding situations where fully booked sailings are not available for sale and yet there are empty cabins due to cancellations or no-shows. In addition, if cruise operators are not able to balance the impact of cancellations and no-shows on their revenue through overbooking, this may result in higher cruise fares to account for the revenue loss.",1,2,014-001-095-069-063-002,1016

Difficult compromises were made as religious groups had to give up observing some of their significant festivals as public holidays. Muslims chose to give up Prophet Muhammad's Birthday as well as an extra day for Hari Raya Puasa. Christians chose to give up the Saturday after Good Friday and Easter Monday. Hindus had to choose between Thaipusam and Deepavali, and chose the latter. Buddhists, who comprised the largest faith and had only one public holiday to begin with, Vesak Day, were not asked to give it up.",2,3,014-001-095-069-064-003,1021

2022-10-03,Audits to Improve Road Safety,014-001-095-069-068,Mr S Iswaran,"  LTA and Traffic Police (TP) take a comprehensive approach to road safety, from the planning and construction of roads, the conduct of regular road safety audits, to the development and enforcement of driver and vehicle safety standards. For instance, for new road infrastructure, LTA requires the contractor to submit reports demonstrating that safety requirements can be met throughout the project's lifecycle. These reports are reviewed by an independent, professional safety team that considers key components such as the contractor's ability to mitigate safety hazards prior to public exposure. LTA also monitors the existing network and traffic data closely, and uses the information to conduct annual road safety audits. Adjustments are then made to specific roads where necessary.",1,2,014-001-095-069-068-002,1036
