Pay is not usually one of the things that they will tell you upfront. But it surely is one of the considerations for a person who has got commitments, a young family and a promising career ahead of him which he is quite sure of. To come in, to take the vagaries of politics and to give that up is a big sacrifice. So, we want to reduce that and help him in the transition.",2,9,014-001-095-032-002-009,17

It is important to emphasise even though they are somewhat related, these are three distinct issues. Let me list them  first, Singapore’s position on the rights of military aircraft to conduct passage and training under international law; second, the role and responsibilities of the authority managing a Flight Information Region (FIR); and finally, the Singapore Armed Forces’ (SAF) air defence system to protect Singapore against aerial threats.",2,6,014-001-095-032-003-006,24

So, for example, Exercise Commando Sling which is between the SAF and the US Air Force, and the Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) Exercise between the SAF and the US Navy.

Earlier this year, the French Navy deployed its ships to the South China Sea. Later this year, the UK will send the Queen Elizabeth Carrier Strike Group with its fighter aircraft F35Bs.

And this authority is designated as the Air Traffic Services (ATS) Authority. The role of the ATS Authority is to ensure safe and efficient flow of air traffic, mostly civilian, within its FIR. In this role, it does not act as a watchdog over disputed areas nor should that authority adopt a partisan role on behalf of any party or for itself.",10,14,014-001-095-032-003-014,32

In this capacity, CAAS has gained an international reputation for managing the Singapore FIR in a safe, orderly, impartial and expeditious manner. In the incident referred to in the Members’ questions, CAAS did not receive any flight plans from the PLAAF, nor did it communicate with the PLAAF or any of its aircraft. I have already mentioned that state aircraft are not required to do so.

Singapore is a small country with a high population density and, therefore, more vulnerable to air threats. The SAF accordingly maintains air defence units at high alert. The RSAF conducts 24/7 surveillance of our skies through both ground-based radars and aerial reconnaissance to detect unknown or suspicious aircraft that are close enough to pose a potential threat. On average, each year, the RSAF responds to more than 350 such incidents.

I thank the Minister for the reply. Since state aircraft are not required to file flight plans when entering our Flight Information Region (FIR), how does Singapore ensure that these aircraft do not have hostile intent? I understand that there is no requirement for them to file these flight plans, but do other countries, by convention, file their flight plans for their state aircraft and is this incident the only time that no flight plans were filed when entering the FIR?",1,23,014-001-095-032-003-023,41

It does not serve our foreign policy; it does not reflect our desire to be principled and neutral. So, again, the answer is with regard to any country and I think we must ask relevant questions. How do you determine whether a particular aircraft of any country is friend or foe? And that is the job of the RSAF. If you have mistaken a friend for a foe, there can be catastrophic consequences. And there are a number of aspects that we would detect, whether it is movement, whether, indeed, flight plans have been filed.",1,24,014-001-095-032-003-024,42

These 350 incidents that we have had, many of which RSAF had actually to mobilise. And as Members will remember, there are a number of incidents in previous years. One was a private aircraft that got lost. And, of course, I suppose seeing an F-16 next to you is, for some, comforting, and it was gently guided to land in a safe area.

The overall theme of the Member's questions, which I think are quite appropriate, is the focus on the welfare of the aviation workers, workers on the frontline and those who are supporting.

The PPE regime has been stepped up across the board and now they don and doff, and they are trained on this already, but we have re-emphasised this. On top of that, of course, is the vaccination programme, which is a general programme that we have undertaken. In terms of the testing regime, we have now RRT, rostered routine testing for workers. Those who are in the high-risk areas, we do seven-day PCR and ART on day three or day four. For those who are in the less risky areas, we conduct a RRT PCR test every 14 days; and on about day seven or day eight, we do the ART testing.",2,36,014-001-095-032-004-036,81

First, to clarify, Jewel is already open. There was a period of closure for about a month and then we re-opened it on 14 June. The passenger terminal buildings remain restricted from public access, because there is a greater potential for interaction, for example, between workers and members of the public.

Just to be very clear, T2 is going through renovation works, so it is not operational. And what MOT and Changi Airport Group did was to work together and come up with the idea of remote processing, remote bays, as it were, for passengers, from very high-risk countries.

What the entire team in MOT, CAAS, CAG, SIA, SATS have endeavoured to do is to adopt a protocol, which is what we have now, which gives us, perhaps, the greatest possible flexibility and adaptability to an evolving situation. That, I think, is key because without that flexibility or dexterity in our response, then there will be a lot more of the fits and starts that the Member refers to, in the way we do things.

I think we should view the IATA Travel Pass (ITP), and also other forms of such certificates, as a two-step process. The first step is how do we establish ways to verify the authenticity of these certificates? So, in other words, I need to make sure that when you say that you are tested and it is PCR negative, or when you say that you are vaccinated, I can trust that this information is accurate and there is a way to do this.

That is a separate discussion. Just because the individual comes from a particular country and has been tested negative or has been vaccinated, does not mean that we automatically do away with some of the restrictions. Because it really depends on, first of all, what is the rate of infection in that source country, how confident are we of the risk level of this individual, when he or she travels to Singapore.

Hence, the representatives from the cleaning sector are part of the Tripartite Cluster for Cleaners, or TCC, which negotiated the wage increases. The TCC, which oversees the cleaning PWM, consists of representatives from the unions, employers, service buyers, as well as the Government. The TCC consulted widely with the industry and had numerous vigorous discussions amongst its members to find common ground that benefits all stakeholders. The TCC was clear in its collective desire to raise the wages of our cleaners in a sustained manner and revalue the work of our cleaners who have been integral in our fight against COVID-19.",18,37,014-001-095-032-009-037,198
2021-07-06,Impact of Revising Wages for Cleaning Sector on Cleaners and Workers in Other Sectors,014-001-095-032-009,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,This is the uniqueness of Singapore's approach because PWM progression is brought about with tripartite consensus. Mr Edward Chia and Mr Sharael Taha asked about the lessons drawn from our experience with the cleaning PWM. A key takeaway is that the negotiated approach of the PWM helps address concerns and allows the sector to raise wages at a pace that is suitable for them.,19,38,014-001-095-032-009-038,199
2021-07-06,Impact of Revising Wages for Cleaning Sector on Cleaners and Workers in Other Sectors,014-001-095-032-009,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,The robust wage increases for the cleaning PWM are fruits of almost a decade of close tripartite collaboration and consistent efforts of the TCC.,20,39,014-001-095-032-009-039,200
2021-07-06,Impact of Revising Wages for Cleaning Sector on Cleaners and Workers in Other Sectors,014-001-095-032-009,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"The TCC has learned over time to harness the PWM design to benefit their workers and the sector. Cleaning companies recognise that Singapore's resident workforce is ageing. And that in addition to better wages, they needed to re-design the jobs to better retain and attract workers to the sector. Their support also assures us that the wage increases are sustainable. Through negotiation, the PWM allows stakeholders to take sector-specific circumstances into account.",21,40,014-001-095-032-009-040,201
2021-07-06,Impact of Revising Wages for Cleaning Sector on Cleaners and Workers in Other Sectors,014-001-095-032-009,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,One example is the six-year wage schedule as highlighted by Ms Yeo Wan Ling. The TCC did so to provide employees and service providers with clarity for long-term planning. Cleaning firms can price in the wage increases in their multi-year contracts with service buyers. There is also a midpoint review so that the TCC can ensure that the wage increases remain sustainable.,22,41,014-001-095-032-009-041,202
2021-07-06,Impact of Revising Wages for Cleaning Sector on Cleaners and Workers in Other Sectors,014-001-095-032-009,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"This pandemic has showed us how the PWM approach is superior to a blunt minimum wage. The sectoral approach has enabled us to advance PWM for cleaners as well as other sectors that are able to adjust to PWM progression in the short term. A blunt minimum wage may not have been able to achieve consensus or as ambitious a wage growth. Sectors such as tourism, aviation, hospitality and others that were severely impacted by COVID-19 would not have been able to agree to such a move. So, our targeted approach enabled the tripartite movement to advance PWM at a pace depending on how different sectors perform in the market.",23,42,014-001-095-032-009-042,203

Employers have to drive productivity improvements in their firms through better technology and processes as raised by Mr Don Wee. They may also have to explore new business models or services to value-add to their customers. Service buyers have to embrace outcome-based contracting and contract durations that encourage investments in new technology. These are indeed directions that the industry has articulated in the Industry Transformation Map for the environmental services sector. Consumers will also contribute by sharing the cost of wage increases and have to pay slightly more for services and products as the sector implements the PWM.",27,46,014-001-095-032-009-046,207

The Government cannot legislate productivity. Productivity growth is a result of workers and firms working together to grow the business and then fairly redistribute the fruits of growth. This is why the tripartite movement believe that the Progressive Wage Model is better than a blunt minimum wage. Each PWM implemented is agreed by a tripartite process, which gives greater confidence that such wage increases can be supported by the market, by the society and will not put employment at risk.",28,47,014-001-095-032-009-047,208

This is something that the Tripartite Workgroup is looking at as part of its deliberations. MOM has been reviewing and enhancing Workfare with significant improvements made recently in 2017 and 2020. At each review, the wage growth of our low-wage workers has been taken into consideration and qualifying criteria adjusted accordingly.

In fact, this is a very important aspect of our PWM negotiations because one of the key considerations we also had was both the survivability of our companies, as well as, at the same time, the employment outcomes of our workers. On the one hand, you want wages to go up but you do not want workers to lose their jobs either if the company closes down or the company says, ""I cannot afford this"", and they have to let go of workers.

These are areas in which the Government intends to provide support. We also understand that in the current market, some sectors are a bit challenged and, therefore, these may require further support. This is where the Tripartite Workgroup will study and roll out the recommendations soon to see how can we can layer on added support to help companies transition into some of these new PWM wage structures as well as for new sectors coming into PWM.",2,54,014-001-095-032-009-054,215

In fact, that is the uniqueness of Singapore's system in that our safeguard is the tripartite consensus, with the employers on board, the employees agreeing, knowing what the projections look like and what they can agree to, and what they see as the market conditions coming forward. I think that is one way in which we ensure that our workers are not left behind or disemployed, fully understanding the risk that for many of our low-wage workers, the profile of this group is really the older groups, the less skilled.

But I think it is important to also look at productivity from the fact that we did not see disemployment in the years where PWM has been implemented. I think it is key. We have also seen how companies have transformed to put in place more mechanisation, different ways of cleaning, more clean technology being put in place, and more being explored.

At the end of the day, there is only so much floor you can clean and so many roads you can sweep. But I think, ultimately, for many companies involved, not just the cleaning sector, but others, that you have to look at productivity at both the employee level and the enterprise level.

This makes us attractive to foreign investors. So, it has always been in our interest to do that. Abiding to these principles and disciplines is not a problem for us at all.

2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),Let me also specifically address two aspects of the Chapter on Movement of Natural Persons in CECA that has been singled out for criticism.,66,66,014-001-095-032-010-066,305
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"First, the PSP pointed out that CECA listed 127 categories of professionals, hence claimed that Indian nationals in these professions can all freely come here to work for a year. This is false because, as I explained earlier, all foreign PMEs have to meet our work pass conditions in order to come and work here.",67,67,014-001-095-032-010-067,306
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"What does the listing then show? The listing shows the types of Indian professionals who may apply to work in Singapore. It does not mean that we must approve their application. It is just that you can apply. India, for its own reasons, requested for such a list, similar to what they have in their FTAs with Korea and Japan. In fact, even if they had not listed the professions, their PMEs could still submit work pass applications to work here. The list probably meant something to India because there may be countries that would not even let you apply. That is how protectionist some countries may become and India is trying to secure their interests there.",68,68,014-001-095-032-010-068,307
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"This is, in fact, how other FTAs work  with or without listing of professions, nationals from our FTA partners are not precluded from submitting work pass applications, which will be evaluated based on our prevailing criteria and work pass conditions.",69,69,014-001-095-032-010-069,308
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Thus, the point being made by PSP on the list of the 127 professions is a red herring. The list does not confer any free pass to any Indian national.",70,70,014-001-095-032-010-070,309
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The second common criticism is that intra-corporate transferees from India can also freely enter Singapore to work. Based on my explanation on how the Chapter works, this is again not true. Intra-corporate transferees also have to meet our work pass qualifying criteria.",71,71,014-001-095-032-010-071,310
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"In any case, the total number of intra-corporate transferees from all over the world, and not just India, that have come to Singapore to work is very small. In 2020, there were only about 500 intra-corporate transferees from India in Singapore – less than 0.3% of all Employment Pass (EP) holders.",72,72,014-001-095-032-010-072,311
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"So, Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope we can put a stop to all this misinformation about our FTAs in general, and CECA, in particular.",73,73,014-001-095-032-010-073,312
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Nevertheless, it is important that we recognise that PMEs in Singapore do face challenges. And I see at least three challenges that they are facing.",74,74,014-001-095-032-010-074,313
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"First, there is more competition from foreign PMEs. Indeed, the number of EP holders has increased, from 65,000 in 2005 to 177,000 in 2020, an increase over 15 years of 112,000, or an annual growth rate of just under 7%. Over this period, however, the increase in the number of local PMEs is much higher, by over 380,000. So, 380,000 for local PMEs and 112,000 for EP holders.",75,75,014-001-095-032-010-075,314
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"These numbers underline an important point  that competition between foreign and local PMEs is not a zero-sum game. In fact, the converse is often true. By combining and complementing local and foreign expertise, we can attract more investments and create many more good jobs and career choices for Singaporeans.",76,76,014-001-095-032-010-076,315
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The downside is that, with more foreign PMEs in Singapore, they can compete for jobs with locals at the company level and, at that level, there can be a zero-sum situation.",77,77,014-001-095-032-010-077,316
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"So, there is a trade-off at play here. If I can put it simply  (a) many jobs, strong competition; (b) few jobs, no competition. And we need to find the right balance where there are more jobs, some competition. That is the way to advance the interest of Singaporeans; not swing to any extreme position, but strike that careful balance and then adjust if we find that that balance is off. But if someone promises you many more jobs with no competition from foreigners, he is selling you snake oil. It is not possible. It cannot be on any government’s policy menu.",78,78,014-001-095-032-010-078,317
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"I should point out that besides complementing our local workforce to create more opportunities, foreign PMEs also help cushion the impact on the local workforce when times are bad. Because during a downturn, foreigners bear the brunt of job losses. During COVID-19, for the 12 months to April 2021, the number of Employment Pass holders dropped by about 21,600, and S Pass holders fell by about 26,800. Altogether, about 50,000 over the 12 months.",79,79,014-001-095-032-010-079,318
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"On the other hand, local employment has been stable. The unemployment rate for local PMEs in June 2020 was at 2.9%. This is from the labour market survey, so, it comes out only once a year during June and this is immediately after the circuit breaker. Resident unemployment rate in September 2020 was 4.8%; in May 2021, 3.8%. It came down by one percentage point. Without the foreign buffer, when our economy ran into trouble, the situation would have been much worse. Singaporeans would have lost many more jobs.",80,80,014-001-095-032-010-080,319
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"So, while the stock of EP and S Pass holders can fluctuate, Singaporeans enjoy greater security of employment, with help from various Government measures. The Jobs Support Scheme helped firms, helped enterprises keep their workers. We have a multi-Ministry National Jobs Council which came up with many initiatives to help place displaced Singaporeans into jobs, including the Jobs Growth Incentive, to encourage companies to hire local workers.",81,81,014-001-095-032-010-081,320
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"So, when Mr Leong Mun Wai said in his Facebook post that we need to recoup a few tens of thousands of jobs from foreign work pass holders, he may not know that we have already done so. This always happens in a downturn.",82,82,014-001-095-032-010-082,321
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"The second challenge is the profile of foreign PMEs. They are concentrated in certain sectors and from certain countries of origin. Indeed, as our digital economy and our needs for tech talent grew, more PMEs from India came into Singapore through our EP framework. And when that concentration happens in areas, such as Changi Business Park, some may feel that we have lost a part of Singapore. Members of the House have raised this concern. We are taking this seriously and studying what we can do to lessen the problem.",83,83,014-001-095-032-010-083,322
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),I hasten to add that dealing with excessive concentration is not a straightforward matter of chopping up the operations of a company here. We do not want to unintentionally cause the whole investment to move elsewhere. This will hurt even more Singaporeans. And this is part of the careful balancing that I talked about earlier.,84,84,014-001-095-032-010-084,323
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"Third, at the company level, there may be unfair hiring practices, with department heads preferring to hire foreign PMEs, or even foreign PMEs from certain countries. This is not right. Whatever system we set up, there will always be some abuses. We must tackle the abuses when they occur as swiftly as possible, while continuing to adopt sensible economic policies that are good for Singapore and Singaporeans.",85,85,014-001-095-032-010-085,324

2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"I have explained the underlying reasons for the difficulties faced by our PMEs, so that we know what it means for us in terms of public policy choices and how we can most effectively address the challenges.

However, over the past year, before identifying the truth of the matter, the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) has laid the blame squarely on the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) as the main culprit for the unfettered inflow of Indian professionals, displacing Singaporeans from their jobs.

We are a small country lacking in natural resources.

India’s talent have continued to look outwards. Therefore, there are relatively more Indian digital and tech talent in Singapore. This is a phenomenon that we have to face.

How can this be possible? This is a misconception. How do I know that this is a misconception? Because today, even as we speak, we still have 22,000 PME jobs that are not filled.

For EPs, we do not impose quotas or levies because there is fierce competition for global talent and worldwide shortages in areas such as tech and digital skills.

So, from the point of view of increased human capital, as well as the investment in SkillsFuture to allow learning on the job, I think there is every reason to have confidence that our local workforce will both have a higher level of human capital as well as have the ability to acquire new skills to function in an age of digital transformation. If we succeed in doing that, then our resident workers will have the comparative advantage to fill these new job slots, the sort of thing that Mr Patrick Tay talked about.",12,272,014-001-095-032-010-272,511

Given our history, the ability to ultimately compete in the world market says that there is something positive of a tilting towards the direction of increased competition. But we make investment in our local workforce, starting from the Primary school level. And there is every good reason to believe that even as we transit to a phase of the country's development where you are not going to have the 5% growth per year, because that was catch-up growth, we are now at the stage where the potential for growth has to come from innovation driving productivity.",13,273,014-001-095-032-010-273,512

If I could ask Minister Tan See Leng whether moving forward, we will consider legislating the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices.

In CECA, just now Minister Ong mentioned that the listing of the 127 professions does not mean that anybody who applies under this will be approved, but it can be rejected even if they apply.

What is the share of that as a percentage of our foreign PMETs, and then, of our total PMET jobs? That is my second question.",9,325,014-001-095-032-010-325,564
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"The next point I want to bring up or question is, the Government has admitted that something needs to be done. There are concerns by Singaporeans regarding jobs and livelihoods. This has been going on and on. Have sufficient measures been taken to address them?",10,326,014-001-095-032-010-326,565
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"One of the questions I want to ask is, has the Government actually tried to find out what the total number of displaced Singaporeans is?",11,327,014-001-095-032-010-327,566
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"I would think that you cannot deny that there are Singaporeans who are displaced. Your narrative is that it is because they do not have the skills. Let us not push the blame to the Universities and the Polytechnics so easily. It has been 20 years since we started the foreign talent policy. Within 20 years, have we still not got our act together in training our people?",12,328,014-001-095-032-010-328,567
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"That is my third question, what is the total number of Singaporeans that are displaced over the last 10 years? They would like to have the job that was taken by a foreigner, but were not able to. They lost their current job and when they got another job, they got a lower pay.",13,329,014-001-095-032-010-329,568
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"There is also a significant number of Singaporeans who are under-employed. If you look at the growth of the Grab driver population, the growth of our traineeship programme and many of our independent workers, are they voluntarily opting for the independent lifestyle or are they facing difficulty in getting a permanent job? Has MOM done a study on those? Have you got the statistics? That is the third question.",14,330,014-001-095-032-010-330,569
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"The fourth question is, of course, we are particularly concerned about the finance and the IT sectors. Minister Tan See Leng has given some numbers. Unfortunately, we do not have enough time to digest those numbers. We will maybe discuss that in our debate in the future. But the fourth question I want to ask is, really, how many foreigners are there in the IT and finance sectors versus the number of Singaporeans and PRs? That is the fourth question. I think the Minister might have given some figures just now.",15,331,014-001-095-032-010-331,570

I think we have all been participating in this debate and listening intently, so I do suggest that you keep to what has been said. A lot of questions have been answered as well. The idea of a debate is to debate the issues that have been raised, so please do that.",1,333,014-001-095-032-010-333,572

2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"  I do not understand what you mean by meaningful, because I am going through those points. Okay, never mind, I will try.",1,336,014-001-095-032-010-336,575
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"The fifth question is, we have had this foreign talent policy for 20 years. But if you look at the way MOM has administered and regulated the flow of foreign PMETs into Singapore, you find that the policies, of course, over time, there is a bit of tightening at a time but, generally, it seems to be too little and too late.",2,337,014-001-095-032-010-337,576
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"For example, the foreign talent policy has started in the late 1990s or around the year 2000. But the Fair Consideration Framework was only introduced in 2014. Only in 2016, I was told that the Fair Consideration Framework watchlist was started. Do you mean there were no problems the one- and a half decade before that? And the threshold salaries that we have, just EP alone, up till 2020 last year, it was still $3,600. At the kind of threshold salary plus no CPF, do you think we are attracting the right foreign talent into Singapore? That is the fifth question.",3,338,014-001-095-032-010-338,577
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"My sixth question is, I totally agree with Minister Tan See Leng about what we are driving at, it is not abolishing things, it is not totally eradicating things. We are also talking about a rebalancing, but the rebalancing cannot come as a result of a natural attrition from COVID-19. There must be a policy recognition that whether our past foreign talent policy was on the right track or not. If we review the policy and we think that there are certain things that we need to change, then make it a policy point. Do not allow natural attrition to come by and say tens of thousands have left Singapore. That is not the way we conduct policy.",4,339,014-001-095-032-010-339,578
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"So, it is about rebalancing and when we talk about rebalancing, Minister Tan also said, one thing is to ensure that Singaporeans can compete fairly or there is no unfair competition. He explained that not having to pay CPF for the Employment Pass holders is not a disadvantage. I respect you for your experience in the private sector, Minister Tan. As an employer, is that not a wage concession? So, how can we say that Singaporeans are not being treated unfairly in the job market competition? That is my sixth question.",5,340,014-001-095-032-010-340,579
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"My seventh question is, Minister Tan said that there is simply not enough local talent. Again, I will raise the point which I have said just now  then what happened to our education system? What happened that after 20 years, you are still telling Singaporeans that we have not enough talent? Of course, we are not saying that we can substitute the foreign PMETs completely. But at least there can be some rebalancing, and we get back to my question just now. And if the Minister admits that there is some displacement of Singaporeans, then that rebalancing means we must slowly allow Singaporeans to be given the first opportunity to take up the jobs first.",6,341,014-001-095-032-010-341,580
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"My last question is, the Minister talked about diversity, but here again, is it not something that MOM should have done long ago about diversity in the workforce when we introduced our foreign talent policy? We also know, because we have worked in an international environment before, that the group dynamics at the workplace can change very fast with changes in the nationality composition in the company. So, especially when MOM is monitoring and regulating the granting of the work passes, do you mean you have not, at the beginning, taken that as an important consideration?",7,342,014-001-095-032-010-342,581
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"And, today, then you have to say that, ""On my watchlist, I have this number of companies that have a very large concentration of PMETs from a single nationality"". So, we really want to understand how MOM actually administers this whole foreign PMET policy.",8,343,014-001-095-032-010-343,582
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"After this, maybe I will add a few more points, I will ask a few more questions about the approval process, some of the experiences I had in the private sector with regard to MOM and its approval process. But my questions are these questions for now.",9,344,014-001-095-032-010-344,583
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Ong Ye Kung,  It is a long list of questions which I am not sure would help us bring the discussion forward.,1,345,014-001-095-032-010-345,584
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Let me take questions four to eight and then one to three. Four to eight is for MOM but I think let us not prolong this because, as Mr Speaker has noticed, many of the questions were actually addressed in our speeches. But if you do not accept what we say, there is very little room for us to further explain.",2,346,014-001-095-032-010-346,585
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The long and short is, we have been extremely successful, as I have explained in my Ministerial Statement, in growing the Singapore economy, creating this multitude of jobs. I gave examples of our port, airport, financial services, ICT, manufacturing, you name it, we are a hub of all hubs. All these would not have been possible if we have not ridden on the wave of globalisation, welcomed foreign talent and given our own people very good training and education to rise up and take the positions.",3,347,014-001-095-032-010-347,586
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I mentioned that our only problem is there is not enough of us. Investors come here, they want to hire Singaporeans. They know our education system is solid and we have such a wonderful reputation around the world, something that, as Singaporeans, we should be proud of. The education system is a bit stressful still, but we should be very proud of that. The problem is, there is still not enough of us.",4,348,014-001-095-032-010-348,587
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"There are some questions, and we have given figures, so I do not think I would answer those. He mentioned a whole series of procedural policy, how come the Fair Consideration Framework came in so late, why is the salary bar for entry raised only later. MOM's successive Manpower Ministers have been reviewing policies all the while. Policies are never static.",5,349,014-001-095-032-010-349,588

Why did you not do it five years ago? It does not work like that. That is not policy-making. That is not how this House works. If it were so, then, for every Bill that is tabled in this House, we have failed, because we should have tabled this Bill five years ago. It does not make sense.",7,351,014-001-095-032-010-351,590

2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Ms Hazel Poa made a point, if I heard correctly, she said, ""We are not against FTAs, we support the FTAs"". I thought we started to have some common ground. Then, she asked me about Chapter 9. She is not a trade negotiator, so, I think those are fair questions. I have been a trade negotiator for many years, I explained how the chapter ought to be read. And when she asked that, I hope it is because she might have read the chapter wrongly to think that Singapore shall allow professionals from 127 categories to enter, no questions asked. After my explanation, I was hoping that she would come to the conclusion that they might have interpreted the chapter wrongly but after hearing Mr Leong Mun Wai speak, I think my assumptions are all wrong.",9,353,014-001-095-032-010-353,592

2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So, after all the explanation and you still come to that conclusion, then I say this  number one, PSP you are against globalisation, you are against FTAs, even though I have gone to great lengths to explain that this is the bedrock of Singapore's economic survival; number two, you are really not taking back the falsehoods and the allegations. I do not think you are taking it back. You do feel that the FTA, that CECA, despite our explanation, let in Indian professionals freely into Singapore.

So, we developed Jurong Island. There were all these heavy industries that we built up. Our Pioneer founding generation leaders under former Minister Mentor Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Dr Goh Keng Swee and so on, I think at that time when we first started, we were very, very heavily invested in these heavy industries. We went on then into manufacturing. In the 1980s, we went into electronics. We did disk drives, wafer fabrication and then, eventually, in early part of 2000, we went into services, we went into bio-pharmaceutical, life sciences and so on and so forth.

Perhaps my experience is very limited; I have just been in healthcare all my life. I do admit that I lobbied at that time, five, six years ago, for an increase in the number of S Passes because of the fact that I needed to deliver a certain level of nursing care.

And, really, because the employer part of it is imputed into our cost, I can tell you with conviction, because I have done it for many, many years in my life, that that package that we pay out is higher than what we do pay to locals.

Because we have to go back and look at the numbers provided by the two Ministers to see what is the share of the Indian PMETs in our overall PMET workforce and to take into consideration what Minister Tan See Leng has said about how we really need them. Then we would like to know whether there are skills transfer programmes, whether our education system is catching up fast enough and also the various practices in the market, before we can make a final conclusion that CECA is really neutral to beneficial for Singapore.",2,377,014-001-095-032-010-377,616

International trade not only provides us with the products that we import and consume, but also connects us to the global market that supports our businesses and sustains our economy, creating the good jobs that Singaporeans have enjoyed in the past and aspire to for the future.

So, the FTAs yield tangible value to our companies. In 2018 alone, I understand that our companies enjoyed more than $1.1 billion in tariff savings. These FTAs accord our businesses preferential market access into the markets of our major trading partners, lowering entry barriers for the export of goods and services, as well as protecting their investments in other countries. This strong FTA network can be a tool for businesses, not only in reducing their costs and time-to-market, but also in ensuring a predictable trading environment.",5,396,014-001-095-032-010-396,635

I would dare say that because our Singapore businesses remain very much plugged into our FTA network, we have been able to ride the storm of COVID-19 a little better than if we were disconnected. We should know first-hand what it Is like to be disconnected, considering the impact we experience in aviation and tourism because of border closures. Trade, along with foreign direct investments into Singapore, will drive our economic recovery and the resumption of business activities post-COVID-19, even as we restlessly reinvent our industries, innovate ideas, products, services and business models to emerge stronger post-pandemic.",6,397,014-001-095-032-010-397,636

Singapore’s Digital Economy Agreements (DEAs) with Chile, New Zealand, Australia and, potentially, the UK look to provide frameworks for regulatory cooperation in support of trade and business in a digital economy and address issues arising from these emerging technologies. As we have heard the Minister for Trade and Industry yesterday, MTI and the Government agencies have been hard at work looking into various new opportunities for us to enter into new trade agreements, including for renewable energy, green economy and so on. On that count, frankly speaking, on behalf of our business community, I would like to acknowledge the efforts of MTI, MOF and all the Government agencies in helping our businesses to be competitive.",8,399,014-001-095-032-010-399,638

Past success does not guarantee future success. We need to exercise humility and restlessly reinvent ourselves. Some areas of concern highlighted in the recent World Competitiveness Report, in my opinion, are rather worrisome. These include potential relocation of businesses being a threat to the Singapore economy; perception of Singapore’s changing attitude towards globalisation, which Minister Ong Ye Kung has also highlighted earlier; the availability of skilled labour, qualified engineers and competent senior managers in Singapore, regardless of nationality. So, the availability of skilled labour and competent senior managers is a concern; as well as our immigration laws preventing hiring of foreign labour. Such perceptions could erode Singapore’s attractiveness as a business capital and our businesses are concerned and, I am sure, the Government is equally concerned.

And I must say that people were laughing; what could two small little economies do to advance the cause of free trade? But we persisted and we got the first agreement done and, thereafter, we went on to do a number of other agreements. When I was Permanent Secretary, I was in the trenches negotiating many agreements with our ASEAN counterparts. And that is how we had the ASEAN Economic Free Trade Agreement; that was enhanced to the ASEAN Economic Community. Thereafter, it was not just ASEAN. There were two things that we did. One was Free Trade Agreements between Singapore and other countries, far bigger economies  Japan, Australia, US; and then, more recently, the European Union.",6,411,014-001-095-032-010-411,650

For example, Japan was very concerned about agriculture. In the case of India, there was an even wider range of concerns. So, let me tell Mr Leong and his team that I spent three years of my life negotiating this agreement because although I was a Permanent Secretary – and Permanent Secretaries usually just supervise, they do not get into the trenches – the Indian side decided that it was an important agreement, they would have a permanent secretary, and Minister George Yeo said, ""Well, you have no choice"".

You have a population that is over a billion. Singapore has a population of, at that time, probably about three-odd million, and I said we will be easily swamped.

The World Bank has ranked Singapore the best in the world in educating our people. So, please do not go around thinking that we have not put in enough effort. And, in fact, we have increased cohort participation rates from 20% of cohort to now 40%, Government-funded. We now have six Universities.

2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"For Minister Ong, in 2016, my parliamentary colleague and Workers' Party Member of Parliament Leon Perera asked the then-Minister for Manpower – and this was arising out of feedback from the ground about CECA – issues about a lot of Indian nationals working on the ground. And the question Mr Leon Perera asked was about the number of intra corporate transferees (ICTs) that were working in Singapore through CECA. At that point, the reply that came was the Ministry does not disclose the data on foreign manpower with breakdown by nationality, including data on ICTs.",2,430,014-001-095-032-010-430,669
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In February this year, Mr Leong Mun Wai of PSP asked a question about the number of ICTs working in Singapore. This time, the Government disclosed the overall ICT numbers over Employment Pass (EP) holders. And the number was something like 5% of EP holders. Today, we have more information, that for last year at least, 500 of these ICTs originated from India.",3,431,014-001-095-032-010-431,670
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),The point I want to make to the Minister and to the Government at large is the opportunity to quell or at least to nip some of these issues in the bud when they start moving into the realm of xenophobia and nativism. One important way to prevent that is the availability of information.,4,432,014-001-095-032-010-432,671
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"In August 2020, a Straits Times reporter mentioned that ""ICTs were a key bone of contention with respect to CECA"".",5,433,014-001-095-032-010-433,672

2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"I hope the Government understands that with more information, actually, we can hold the line better before these discussions move into a realm of xenophobia and so forth.",7,435,014-001-095-032-010-435,674
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),My question to Minister Tan See Leng pertains to TAFEP and the strengthening of the enforcement arm of TAFEP. We had an exchange at the opening of Parliament about this and I would just like to confirm with Dr Tan whether raising the numbers in the enforcement arm of TAFEP is on the cards and what discussions have taken place since August last year insofar as how TAFEP will be beefed up. The Workers' Party has a position about anti-discrimination legislation. Is that something that MOM will be prepared to look into?,8,436,014-001-095-032-010-436,675

The suggestion that he talked about, the position he had alluded to, in terms of legislation and all that, it is not something that has just come out from the Workers' Party. If you go back in terms of the past proceedings, I believe that quite a number of the Labour Members of Parliament, including Mr Patrick Tay and even non-Labour Members of Parliament, such as Mr Louis Ng, have also raised it at different times.",2,438,014-001-095-032-010-438,677
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Dr Tan See Leng,"The assurance that I want to give to the House – to everyone who has raised it and who is concerned about this – is to allow myself, together with the team, together with the tripartite partners, to go deep, look at all the different implications, look at also the various options that we have to see how we can strengthen it.

2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Dr Tan See Leng,"On the one hand, we want to continue to strengthen, to tighten. On the other hand, businesses have the competing interest of asking us to be a bit more lax. One of the reassurances that our Ministry wants to give to Members of the House here is our consistent focus on – and we have never diverted our attention away from it – developing the Singaporean Core. We are fully cognisant of the angst, the fears, the worries about making sure that there is fair, there is equal opportunity in terms of capability development, capability transfer, fair hiring, promotions and so on and so forth. All those things, we will be reviewing in order for us to strengthen that framework.",4,440,014-001-095-032-010-440,679

2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I take to heart what the Leader of the Opposition has said, that with information, we can quell such falsehoods much earlier. We work in a bureaucracy. Some data is classified secret, confidential and so on. So, we are not at liberty to always disclose them. But what you say is true. Some information, it is better for it to come out early and then we can move on. Especially, as you said, when it concerns issues like racism or xenophobia, it is much better to quell it early.",2,444,014-001-095-032-010-444,683

2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Negotiating an FTA requires a lot of dedication and hard work. It takes a toll on the family because you are out of the country all the time. Our negotiators are up against very formidable partners sometimes. Our job is to advance Singapore's interests while protecting our areas of sensitivities. But we work hard at it, nevertheless, because we know it makes a huge difference to Singapore. It benefits industries and companies, creates jobs for our people, secures our place in the world. This is where we are coming from.",5,447,014-001-095-032-010-447,686

2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"When we explained how an FTA works and how Chapter 9 works, it is a statement of fact. This is how it works. It is not a matter of your opinion or your perspective. The logical thing for PSP to do, I felt, is to withdraw their allegations. Then, we can discuss employment policies, how we can better protect, educate, train our workers. These are very legitimate questions.",7,449,014-001-095-032-010-449,688
2021-07-06,Free Trade Agreements and Foreign Manpower,014-001-095-032-010,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But PSP did not do the logical thing. I could not hear a definitive position from Mr Leong Mun Wai or Ms Hazel Poa. They waffled a bit and then I think what I heard was they cannot conclude either way now whether CECA is better or worse for our workers. But if you cannot conclude either way, then the honourable thing is to also withdraw the allegations while you figure out which way you want to lean. But I do not think what we saw was logical or honourable.",8,450,014-001-095-032-010-450,689

Given that one in 10 Singaporeans aged 60 and above have the chance of being diagnosed with dementia, and with the numbers expected to rise to 80,000 in 2030, I believe that the LPA should be widely promoted to all Singaporeans as it allows an individual to make an early choice of a proxy decision-maker whom they can trust. This reassures donors that their interest will be taken care of should they lose their mental capacity one day. Hence, I support the Mental Capacity (Amendment) Bill to facilitate more Singaporeans to apply for an LPA.",2,4,014-001-095-032-012-004,708

SGAs can help to guide and assist seniors who are immobile and cannot approach the Citizen Connect Centres by themselves in the application. In addition, special considerations can be made for seniors, who are immobile, to have the LPA Certificate Issuers (CIs) visit their homes together with the SGAs, to complete the LPA application, to give them the peace of mind.

I am concerned that this may create an opportunity for vulnerable seniors to be targets of fraud by fraudulent donees who want to take advantage of them. Without the requirement for donors and donees to meet up, seniors might be unknowingly coaxed into creating an LPA appointment by fraudulent donees. Although donors are still required to meet with the Certificate Issuers (CIs) to ensure that the donor has the mental capacity to make the LPA and understands the effect of an LPA, without a third person witnessing the donees' identity, it can become challenging for the Certificate Issuers to act as a safeguard in preventing fraud from occurring.",10,12,014-001-095-032-012-012,716

In recent times, there have been several noteworthy cybersecurity breaches on some cloud computing providers. Should a security breach result in e-LPA documents being amended without the donors' or donees' knowledge, a transaction executed in good faith based on the LPA may result in a loss for the donors and/or liability for the donees.",12,14,014-001-095-032-012-014,718

Should the transaction that is in progress when the breach occurred be halted to determine if there has been any adversarial impact made to the LPA?",13,15,014-001-095-032-012-015,719
2021-07-06,Mental Capacity (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-032-012,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),The Bill introduces section 16A that affords protection of donees and others if the e-LPA has a relevant error. I would like to propose that the section should also be expanded to include relevant protections from liabilities of donors and donees as a result of cyberattacks and cybersecurity breaches.

Is there any possibility of bundling workshops on LPAs with the Singapore Digital Office's courses to improve our elderly's digital literacy, thereby killing two birds with one stone?

I am worried that such safeguards are not sufficient. How can we ensure that elderly, in particular, those who are less educated, will not be cheated? This is particularly a concern where the donors and donees are not related. Donees have control over the financial assets of the donor. If they siphon away such resources for themselves, ultimately, the other family members or the Government will have to pick up the tab or pay for the care of the donors.",5,24,014-001-095-032-012-024,728

Instead of asking the aged home or caregiver to make an appointment to see the regular doctor for the sake of retrieving the medical record a few months later, would it not be much faster if the information can be shared between the Government restructured hospitals, including IMH, with OPG in a secured manner? This current process is time-consuming and does no service to the patient. For the case which I had handled, I prayed that my client was able to outlive the Court order.

At the same time, the new process will not be at the expense of donor protection.

Presently, the $75 application fee waiver for LPA Form 1 for Singaporeans has been extended to 31 March 2023, so as to encourage more Singaporeans to plan ahead and apply for an LPA. This is actually the fourth extension granted by the OPG since its first extension in 2016 and we would often see an influx in take-up rates when the waiver deadline draws close; this would inevitably cause the OPG backend to be stretched in terms of manpower while processing these new LPAs. In light that the LPAs will now be digitalised, would the Ministry consider removing the registration fees for LPA Form 1 entirely?

This is a requirement before he or she can exercise the powers under the LPA. Alternatively, the donee can be required to submit a Statutory Declaration to confirm that the donor has been certified by a doctor to lack mental capacity. Perhaps, it is useful to have such a general requirement and to make it mandatory for banks and real estate firms, who handle LPA-related transactions, to keep OPG or their regulators informed once a request to exercise LPA is made by a donee.",3,97,014-001-095-032-012-097,801

It would, thus, be useful to consider a requirement for the CI to highlight to OPG when facing donees who are multiple donees. OPG can then subsequently follow up and advise the donor that the chosen donee is a multiple donee, and if they want, they can make his or her informed choice. In this regard, perhaps, it would be useful to consider a limit on the maximum number of LPAs on which someone can be appointed as a donee.",7,101,014-001-095-032-012-101,805

Having donees who are non-family members, or who are no longer directly related by virtue of a divorce or a re-marriage, may give rise to potential misunderstandings or conflicts in the future. In this regard, it would be useful to consider requiring CIs to meet potential donees in person too and not just the donors.

Let me clarify that clause 9 is intended to cover errors arising from the conversion of the hard copy LPA into the electronic LPAs, not errors within the hard copy LPAs. I note Miss Cheryl Chan and Mr Louis Ng's concern on whether transactions may rely on hard copy LPAs containing errors and would like to assure that these errors, such as repeated page numbers, are highly unlikely. OPG has checked through all scanned copies of existing registered LPAs to minimise any risk of errors.",12,127,014-001-095-032-012-127,831

Therefore, while donees and third parties are not prevented from referencing the hard copy LPAs, the superseded hard copy LPA should not be relied upon for transactions. This is because any note on the occurrence of certain important events will only be attached to the electronic LPA henceforth. Such events include the donee's bankruptcy, which would revoke his power to manage the donor's financial matters. As such, I strongly encourage all parties to rely on the electronic copy when transacting.",13,128,014-001-095-032-012-128,832

The answer is yes. The electronic copy only becomes the LPA after the 90-day period if no relevant error is spotted and reported. If a relevant error is reported to OPG, the electronic copy becomes the LPA either on the 91st day or on the day which the Public Guardian rectifies the relevant error, whichever is later.",14,129,014-001-095-032-012-129,833

I wish to clarify that the UK's service does not allow for the online registration of electronic LPAs.

Given this, comparisons between OPGO and the UK's online system might not be apt but I take Mr Louis Ng's point on the need to ensure that the roll-out is smooth.

2021-07-06,Mental Capacity (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-032-012,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Eric Chua),"Nonetheless, should the Public Guardian have evidence of fraud or undue pressure, she may seek the Court’s directions under existing section 17 of the MCA on whether the LPA should be registered. For Mr Melvin Yong’s and Ms Sylvia Lim’s information, the Public Guardian would interview the donor to assess if the donor had voluntarily made the LPA. If necessary, the Public Guardian may rely on her existing powers to obtain further information to determine the issue. This approach would similarly be taken for cases that Miss Cheryl Chan has raised, for example, when the donor is already experiencing an early onset of dementia.",51,166,014-001-095-032-012-166,870
2021-07-06,Mental Capacity (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-032-012,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Eric Chua),"Mr Louis Ng asked if the Public Guardian could interview persons other than the donor. The Public Guardian may exercise her investigative powers under the existing section 32 of the MCA to interview any person who has the relevant information relating to a donor who has lost mental capacity. As the number of doneeship appointments is confidential, we need to be careful on how much is shared and with whom. Thus, under the new section 31A of the MCA, we have enabled the Public Guardian to disclose this information to the donor only so that he or she may make an informed decision.",52,167,014-001-095-032-012-167,871

For example, Mr Seah Kian Peng asked to require the Public Guardian to disclose multiple doneeships in all cases. I wish to clarify that the intent of the amendment is to cover select cases where there are reasonable grounds to doubt the integrity of the LPA-making process. With more than 95% of donees being trusted family members who are chosen by donors themselves, we agree with Ms Sylvia Lim that multiple doneeships are not uncommon. For instance, a daughter may be appointed as donee for her father, mother and husband. The Certificate Issuer will also have certified that the donor is not under undue pressure or fraud to appoint a particular person as donee. The Public Guardian will exercise her discretion judiciously when disclosing the donees’ information in the exceptional cases where fraud or undue pressure is suspected.",53,168,014-001-095-032-012-168,872

It is important that donors appoint donees whom they trust. But in the rare case where a donee abuses his or her powers, the Public Guardian is empowered to investigate the case and may apply to the Court under the existing section 17 of the MCA to revoke the LPA. Application to the Court is necessary as the Court plays the role as the finder of facts to determine whether mismanagement or breach of trust has occurred. That said, the concerned party need only report the case to the Public Guardian. The Public Guardian can then take the case to Court, if necessary.",55,170,014-001-095-032-012-170,874

We wholeheartedly agree. My Ministry has been working closely with MOH to encourage citizens to pre-plan and to make their LPAs and Advance Care Plans together. The Advance Care Plan allows a person to consider their care preferences and communicate their wishes to their ""healthcare spokesperson"", who can speak on their behalf in the future.

2021-07-06,Registration of Births and Deaths Bill,014-001-095-032-015,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"  Mdm Deputy Speaker, the new Registration of Births and Deaths Bill is an improved framework that overhauls and streamlines the registration of the two events that bookend every human life as it were  births and deaths. It provides clear rules on who holds the responsibility to report to the Government in the event of birth or death under a wide range of foreseeable scenarios. While I support the Bill, I have a few clarifications to seek.",1,3,014-001-095-032-015-003,974
2021-07-06,Registration of Births and Deaths Bill,014-001-095-032-015,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Firstly, in respect of birth registrations, I would like to confirm that double-barrelled surnames are allowed and provided for under the Bill and its processes. In the current Registration of Births and Deaths Act, section 10 provides guidance on how a child's surname is given although there is no explicit reference to double-barrelled surnames. Currently, parents are able to register their child with a double-barrelled surname if they choose to do so. However, under the Bill, there is no longer any reference to surname. Could the Minister give us some guidance to the kinds of surnames that would be permissible for the child?",2,4,014-001-095-032-015-004,975
2021-07-06,Registration of Births and Deaths Bill,014-001-095-032-015,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Secondly, I would like to speak on double-barrelled race designations. With inter-ethnic marriages going up from 18.4% of all marriages in 2009 to 22.9% in 2019, it is important for children of such unions to have the opportunity to grow up with an appreciation of their mixed parentage, if their parents choose to signify that by choosing double-barrelled race classifications for their children. As a parent of children of mixed ethnicity myself, I am particularly conscious of this.",3,5,014-001-095-032-015-005,976
2021-07-06,Registration of Births and Deaths Bill,014-001-095-032-015,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In 2011, ICA implemented the registration of double-barrelled race options for Singaporean children born to parents of different ethnic groups. By this new option, if one parent is Chinese and the other is Indian, the child's race may be recorded as Chinese, or Indian, or Chinese-Indian, or Indian-Chinese, for example.",4,6,014-001-095-032-015-006,977
2021-07-06,Registration of Births and Deaths Bill,014-001-095-032-015,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In this respect, I wonder if the Registry of Births and Deaths is able to provide some indication of trends, in similar fashion to what is reported on marriages, on the proportion of births to parents of different ethnicities. Amongst them, what is the proportion of children who have been assigned double-barrelled race by their parents? I note that in the first two months of 2011, the parents of one in five newborn babies of mixed parentage chose the double-barrelled race option based on data that the Government released back then.",5,7,014-001-095-032-015-007,978
2021-07-06,Registration of Births and Deaths Bill,014-001-095-032-015,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),I also wonder if the Ministry would consider streamlining the process by which parents of mixed ethnicity can apply to change the racial classification on their child's NRIC to a double-barrelled racial classification in cases where the child was registered at birth as bearing solely one ethnicity as they would have had to be prior to 2011.,6,8,014-001-095-032-015-008,979

Given the increasing ethnic diversity in our demographic make-up, will the ICA also be open to requests for other ethnic characters as well?

At present, the next-of-kin would have to express the preferred mode of disposal, cremation or burial when they register the death. The next-of-kin would then receive a permit to bury or cremate contained in the death certificate. Based on that, a funeral director would then be able to proceed to book slots for cremation or burial. A death certificate may also be required to engage your funeral director in order for services, such as the embalming of bodies and the use of funeral parlour compounds, to be performed.",11,13,014-001-095-032-015-013,984

The new process requires a medical practitioner to certify and submit the death of a person online following which the death certificate is issued digitally. I also understand that the doctor or hospital can assist in printing the certificate for families who have difficulties accessing the digital certificates. Could the Minister of State clarify if this new process will result in increased fees compared to the current process since, for example, the doctor will now have to print the certificate or is it envisaged for it to be without charge?",3,30,014-001-095-032-015-030,1001

2021-07-06,Registration of Births and Deaths Bill,014-001-095-032-015,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Third, the Bill also requires in some cases under clause 22(2)(d) the duty for reporting of a death to fall on persons that may not be at all related or associated to the deceased, therefore, there is this undue burden, failing which the person will be considered guilty of an offence and fined up to $1,500 and/or imprisonment of up to a month. The Minister of State had earlier mentioned about unnatural death briefly. So, for the clarity of the public, can the Minister of State clarify if, for example, a person on a morning jog finds a dead body and calls the Police, would the person still be liable to report the death to a medical practitioner under this section?

In the past three years, about 17% of total births in Singapore are those of children born to parents who are both foreigners and, therefore, do not qualify for Singapore Citizenship by birth. There is also a small number of children born to at least one Singaporean parent but are not granted Singapore Citizenship for reasons such as the parents not being legally married at the time of the child's birth.

Our current sexuality education curriculum talks about the moral and legal consequences of risky sexual behaviours in a single class in Secondary 1. This is hardly enough. We need to teach our youths that their actions have far larger repercussions than just legal.

Today, Singapore is facing a long overdue reckoning with a scale of sexual harm and trauma that happens in this country. Yet, when we break down how much classroom time is spent on sexuality education, we find that students get just 25 hours of class time on it.

They now spill over into the physical realm, with real-world consequences. We have seen this globally, with the recent uptick in international ransomware attacks. In early May, the Colonial Pipeline Company operating the largest fuel pipeline in the US East Coast suffered a ransomware attack. This prompted the company to shut down the pipeline’s operations for close to a week, affecting the supply of fuel to about 50 million customers. In mid-May, Ireland and New Zealand’s healthcare services suffered from separate ransomware attacks.

These families then had to sell the non-subsidised flat once their booked HDB flat or EC unit was completed, without a need to fulfil the typical five-year MOP.

The extent of the delay varies by BTO project, and depends on site-specific factors such as manpower availability, the contractor’s performance and available supply of materials. The average waiting time for BTO projects launched in 2020 was around four to five years. Generally, the waiting time for newly launched BTO projects is expected to be longer, due to longer time needed to prepare the sites, as well as ongoing requirements to comply with strict SMMs amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.",2,3,014-001-095-032-033-003,1245

In total, fathers can now enjoy up to eight weeks of leave in their child’s first year to bond with their newborns and care for their wives.

We have introduced a number of measures to streamline divorce proceedings. These include  (a) the simplified case management track. Parties who agree on the divorce and ancillary matters prior to the filing of the action can obtain a divorce on this track without going through lengthy court proceedings. They can navigate this on their own without the need to incur legal fees. This saves parties both costs and time. The majority of divorce cases are filed on the simplified track. In 2020, 60% of cases were filed on the simplified track; (b) the use of alternative dispute resolution. For cases that do not proceed on the simplified track, many have been resolved through mediation. Mediation helps parties address the key issues without the need for lengthy or acrimonious hearings. In 2020, 90% of cases that went through mediation either reached a full or partial settlement; and (c) the use of the judge-led approach, where Judges take a more proactive role in proceedings by taking the lead and controlling the pace of the proceedings. This is a less adversarial mode of proceedings, which avoids unnecessary disputes, acrimony and protracted hearings. Nevertheless, we agree that more can be done because there continue to be cases where it is too costly and protracted, unnecessarily so.

Contractors who have applied for an HDB renovation permit are also required to put up a Notice of Renovation Works outside the flat entrance during the renovation period so neighbours will know whom to contact if they face issues. To expand outreach, we have also added the notices to the OneService app. From July 2021, HDB residents will be able to receive and view notices for upcoming flat renovation works at their blocks, that have been approved by HDB, through the app. The advanced notices will allow immediate neighbours who may be affected to make alternative arrangements such as returning to office for work, if necessary, or to approach the contractors to adjust the renovation schedules for noisier works.

Hacking work can only be carried out on weekdays, with only up to two approved handheld power tools in use at any point in time and must be completed within three days. Contractors that carry out these works are also required to close the doors and windows of the flat during renovations to minimise the noise generated.
