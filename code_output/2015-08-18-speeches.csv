2015-08-18,Land Assessment Tax for PUB's Waterworks in Johor,012-002-093-023-001,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"  Mdm Speaker, as the House is aware, the Public Utilities Board (PUB) owns the Johor River Waterworks, in the Kota Tinggi District of Johor. The Waterworks extracts and treats water from the Johor River. This is done in accordance with the 1962 Water Agreement.",1,2,012-002-093-023-001-002,2

2015-08-18,Land Assessment Tax for PUB's Waterworks in Johor,012-002-093-023-001,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"In late-2014, the Kota Tinggi District Council issued a Notice seeking to double the rate of land assessment tax imposed on the Waterworks. The revised rate was more than double that of the next highest rate in the entire Kota Tinggi District. The Waterworks' assessed property value was also increased. The new rate was applied to a category which was created solely for PUB.",3,4,012-002-093-023-001-004,4

2015-08-18,Land Assessment Tax for PUB's Waterworks in Johor,012-002-093-023-001,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam),"PUB's operations in Johor are governed by the 1962 Water Agreement. That Agreement governs what PUB has to pay. PUB is not obliged to pay the land assessment tax which has been sought to be imposed. There is some additional background on Johor authorities imposing such taxes, in the past.",5,6,012-002-093-023-001-006,6

In respect of the latest tax assessments, we have registered our concerns. My Ministry has done so with the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs through two Third Person Notes (TPN). PUB has got in touch with the Kota Tinggi District Council on the same. I have also raised this issue directly with my Malaysian counterpart, Foreign Minister Anifah Aman, twice, in April 2015 and on 4 August 2015. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has also spoken directly to Prime Minister Najib Razak in May 2015.",7,8,012-002-093-023-001-008,8

The Malaysian federal government has guaranteed in the Separation Agreement that Johor would abide by the 1962 Water Agreement, and as I have said earlier, the Agreement does not require the payment of this land tax. We have requested the Malaysian federal government to address this issue. The federal government has indicated that it would work with the Johor state government to address our concerns.

2015-08-18,Prices Charged at Hawker and Food Centres,012-002-093-023-002,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"  Hawker centres are a unique Singapore feature and they are, in my opinion, essential social infrastructure. They are places where Singaporeans from all walks of life can gather, interact and enjoy fresh food at affordable prices. Over 85% of our hawkers today pay less than $1,500 per month in rent and in fact 41% of them are paying subsidised rental ranging from $160 to $384.",1,2,012-002-093-023-002-002,12

2015-08-18,Prices Charged at Hawker and Food Centres,012-002-093-023-002,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"Three years ago, we made further policy changes to remove the speculative element from hawker stalls. For instance, now we insist that all hawker stalls have to be personally operated. The stalls are not a way for landlords to make money. The National Environment Agency (NEA) has disallowed the practice of assignments and subletting. Furthermore, NEA also abolished the concept of ""reserve rent"" for hawker stalls during the bidding process. NEA offers available vacant stalls at monthly tender exercises and accepts all valid competitive bids. This has resulted in the current situation where about half of the successful bids are now below 85% of the assessed market rent. The tendered rentals have been falling and in fact fell by 3.4% last year - the lowest successful tendered rental is now $1 a month. Not a typo error!",3,4,012-002-093-023-002-004,14

2015-08-18,Prices Charged at Hawker and Food Centres,012-002-093-023-002,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"To provide Singaporeans with even more affordable food options, we announced that the Government is building 20 new hawker centres, particularly in estates that have fewer cooked food stalls. Another trial that we are embarking on is the appointment of social enterprises to act as managing agents. For instance, NEA has appointed NTUC Foodfare Co-operative Ltd and Fei Siong Food Management Pte Ltd as managing agents to run two new hawker centres at Bukit Panjang and Hougang respectively on a not-for-profit basis.",5,6,012-002-093-023-002-006,16

2015-08-18,Prices Charged at Hawker and Food Centres,012-002-093-023-002,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"These social enterprises, we hope, will bring new ideas based on their experience in food and beverage operations. We hope they will diversify food options, enhance the dining experience for patrons, and raise the productivity for hawker centres, while keeping food prices affordable. For example - and this is a useful measure - both NTUC Foodfare and Fei Siong will offer discounted bulk purchasing of ingredients to help hawkers reduce the cost of raw materials. In fact, it is the cost of ingredients and raw materials that is the biggest cost driver for hawker stalls, not rentals. Fei Siong has also launched a programme to nurture a new generation of hawkers by providing training and opportunities to enter this field. We believe these initiatives are important and we hope they will help ensure the sustainability of hawkers in the future.",7,8,012-002-093-023-002-008,18

2015-08-18,Prices Charged at Hawker and Food Centres,012-002-093-023-002,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"NEA also welcomes other initiatives that the social enterprises may decide to roll out. For instance, they have insisted that the hawkers in these two centres offer at least a few budget meals on the menu. Over and above that, for low-income families who need help with their basic needs, the Government provides additional cash assistance and vouchers through the ComCare Short-to-Medium Term Assistance Scheme. These schemes are all designed to ensure that there will always be a low-cost option for food on the table.",9,10,012-002-093-023-002-010,20

2015-08-18,Prices Charged at Hawker and Food Centres,012-002-093-023-002,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"But there is one cost that has gone up, and that is manpower cost, particularly because we have increased the wages for cleaners through progressive wages. Members of this House will recall that the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) was the first to move on progressive wages by effecting legislative changes, and this has resulted in what I believe is a well-justified and well-deserved increase in wages for cleaners. There has also been some increase for hawker assistants. Again, I would expect that Members of the House would support these wage increases. Our hawkers will have to prepare for a future, where wage costs will be higher and like many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Singapore, they will have to try to figure how to do more with less manpower and basically, it is about enhancing productivity.",11,12,012-002-093-023-002-012,22

NEA will ensure that the interests of hawkers, cleaners, hawker assistants and patrons are well taken care of. We believe these will enable us to ensure that hawker centres continue to fulfil their very important social function in Singapore.",15,16,012-002-093-023-002-016,26
2015-08-18,Prices Charged at Hawker and Food Centres,012-002-093-023-002,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"  I thank the Minister for his response. I really appreciate the details. Just two supplementary questions. The first is with regards to the sharing of responsibility for keeping food affordable for the working class. A lot of hawkers are quite sympathetic to the need to keep food affordable, but they find the idea of price caps quite offensive because it feels like the responsibility for keeping food affordable is passed on to them by the social enterprises in charge and, by extension, the agency that endorses them. The perception -- and it may be wrong -- is ""How can the hawker be the only one held responsible for keeping food affordable?"" So, the first question is can the Ministry clarify how it works with all stakeholders to help them understand how they all share the responsibility for keeping food prices fair.",1,17,012-002-093-023-002-017,27
2015-08-18,Prices Charged at Hawker and Food Centres,012-002-093-023-002,Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member),"The second question is about price versus value. There is unhappy sentiment on the ground that the discussion about hawker food at the top is overly centred on price, rather than value. The idea being, ""What if we are keeping food prices down because of cost-cutting and low quality, low nutrition ingredients?"" So, the question is how does the Ministry work with the stakeholders to not just look at keeping prices fair but keeping the value high, in particular, cultural heritage value and nutritional value of hawker food.",2,18,012-002-093-023-002-018,28
2015-08-18,Prices Charged at Hawker and Food Centres,012-002-093-023-002,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"  I thank the Member for her equally detailed supplementary questions. The issue of affordable food is very important. It goes beyond simple economics. This is an important social and, dare I say, even politically-charged issue in Singapore. My approach is very simple. I believe there must always be a low-cost option on the table and this low-cost option should be available on the table in a place where people from all walks of life have access to. This democratisation of the dining experience in Singapore is something valuable; it is part of the social glue that binds us together; it is part of what defines us as Singaporeans.",1,19,012-002-093-023-002-019,29
2015-08-18,Prices Charged at Hawker and Food Centres,012-002-093-023-002,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Once we accept that there is value in ensuring that there is always a low-cost option on the table, the next question, as the Member has correctly identified, is that there are multiple stakeholders. There used to be this thinking -- which fortunately, has now been debunked -- that the main cost driver was rentals. With the policy changes over the last several years, during the term of this government, as well as the data that has emerged, it is very clear now that rentals are not the major cost drivers. Nevertheless, as the Minister-in-charge of NEA, I have done my best to push rentals down. I have done that by increasing the supply; I have done that by removing the speculative element; I have done that by ensuring everyone knows that this is about food and this is not a property play; I have also done that by removing reserve rents; I have also instructed NEA to accept all valid competitive bids, and hence, as I have told the House, the lowest successful tendered bid to-date is $1.",2,20,012-002-093-023-002-020,30
2015-08-18,Prices Charged at Hawker and Food Centres,012-002-093-023-002,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"All that has been achieved. The data is also out there to prove that 85% of our hawkers pay less than $1,500 of rental. Rent is coming down; it is not the main component of operating cost. If anybody has lost out due to the rental reduction, it is the main landlord which, in this case, is the Government. I am prepared to take that because I believe this is social infrastructure.",3,21,012-002-093-023-002-021,31
2015-08-18,Prices Charged at Hawker and Food Centres,012-002-093-023-002,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"The next important issue is about manpower. Yes, I stand guilty as charged for raising the cost of cleaning in Singapore. But I think I stand with the support of all of you that we were right to impose progressive wages and to increase wages and employment conditions for cleaners. So, we have lowered rentals; but yes, manpower cost has gone up.",4,22,012-002-093-023-002-022,32
2015-08-18,Prices Charged at Hawker and Food Centres,012-002-093-023-002,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Now, we have further evidence that the key cost driver is not even manpower, but it is actually ingredients. That is really the reason why I was so keen to get social enterprises involved and in particular, NTUC FoodFare. Members will recall nearly four decades or more ago, when we were worried about the cost of raw food, the advent of NTUC FairPrice, the social enterprise supplying raw food at very competitive prices - not subsidised, but very competitive prices. It had a salutary effect on the rest of the market. I am trying and hoping that this same approach would work for cooked food as well.",5,23,012-002-093-023-002-023,33
2015-08-18,Prices Charged at Hawker and Food Centres,012-002-093-023-002,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Hence, I am happy that NTUC FoodFare took up the challenge. They are not landlords, they are managing agents, and I have told them very clearly that my main objective is help keep prices affordable, as well as bring down the cost of raw ingredients for hawkers. Everything else is an extra.",6,24,012-002-093-023-002-024,34
2015-08-18,Prices Charged at Hawker and Food Centres,012-002-093-023-002,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Yes, I know there has been some disquiet about this insistence on budget meals. But, actually, this is not a new idea. All of us will remember school canteens, and even today, workplace canteens, where in exchange for low or subsidised rentals, the hawkers sell their food at low prices or even at prices which are approved by the landlord. This is a system, in which by having some price restraint, you are prepared to accept lower rentals and you do your best to bring down the overall cost of doing business. I hope you will appreciate that it is a tight rope, it is a balancing act between hawkers, employees, people of Singapore, and the need to make it affordable and accessible to everyone.",7,25,012-002-093-023-002-025,35
2015-08-18,Prices Charged at Hawker and Food Centres,012-002-093-023-002,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"This is the journey we have embarked on. This is a pilot, in a sense, because we have only a few centres which are run by social enterprises so far. Let us take a data-driven approach, watch the prices, quality of the food and nutrition, and let us calibrate the policy along the way.",8,26,012-002-093-023-002-026,36
2015-08-18,Prices Charged at Hawker and Food Centres,012-002-093-023-002,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"My final point is that we will inject more transparency into this system. Since I am also overseeing Smart Nation initiatives, we are looking at having apps which will display the prices of food in every single stall in Singapore; maybe in real time, maybe even to allow crowdsourcing function, so you can tell us whether you think it is value for money, and maybe the experts would even be able to assess nutritional value and the rest of it.",9,27,012-002-093-023-002-027,37

If anyone loses, it is NEA and the Government, but I think that we can and we should be prepared to tolerate that. Thank you.",10,28,012-002-093-023-002-028,38

Essentially, when the member receives the CPF LIFE amount, that additional money can be used for the healthcare needs as well. This is separate from the Medisave amount.

From what I understand, currently only the main caregivers of elderly persons aged 65 and above, and persons with disabilities are entitled to the caregiver training grant of $200. Would MOH consider (i) including mental illness under the caregiver training grant for caregivers of patients with mental illness; and (ii) increasing the caregiver training grant and allowing more than one main caregiver to be trained for each patient with mental illness, and understanding the challenges that come with giving care to patients with mental illness?",2,16,012-002-093-023-004-016,73

And what IMH does is, MOH, together with IMH, consistently review the mental services capacity within the system and if there is a need to create more services and capacity, we will do so when appropriate. One of the ways that MOH, together with IMH, has worked to reduce reliance on tertiary services, as I have said, and, therefore, less demand on tertiary beds, is to develop Community Mental Health. One of the ways really is to work with GPs, as I noted earlier, to manage the more stable patients within the community. In fact, in the community, they have also expanded memory clinics in the restructured hospitals and the capacities of memory clinics. They are also working on increasing the capabilities for dementia care in nursing homes, day care centres as well as in the community hospitals, St Luke's Hospital and St Andrew's Hospital.",1,17,012-002-093-023-004-017,74

But the caregiver training grant is given per recipient, to a care recipient per year. It is $200 per care recipient. So, you are right to say that it means that if you require two caregivers, you still get $200 per year. But having said that, if it is really necessary to have more than one caregiver, it is possible to tap on other sources of funds. For instance, for IMH, there is a Woodbridge Hospital Charity Fund that you can tap on for caregiving training and other activities. And I am sure that if it is needed, we will definitely be able to get the fund, the resources, to help support the caregivers.",3,19,012-002-093-023-004-019,76

In fact, as I have said, IMH is reorganising and reviewing its nursing model of care. And in fact, they are re-categorising patients, including long-stay patients, medium-stay patients, and so on, according to their acuity and ability levels. So, for patients who may not need long-term institutional care and we do want to encourage as many to reintegrate back into the community as possible, there will be different levels of support and care for them, according to their needs. Even if they go back into the community, there is always a hotline available for either the patient or the caregiver to call these teams to get guidance. In fact, the teams can actually go for home visits and escort them back to IMH or to one of our satellite outpatient clinics if needed. So the idea really is to have a strong support network to care for the patients according to the levels of acuity. And IMH itself does have long-term patients too.",1,22,012-002-093-023-004-022,79

2015-08-18,System Design of North-South and East-West MRT Lines,012-002-093-023-005,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"  Mdm Speaker, as explained at the LTA-SMRT joint briefing on 29 July 2015, the disruption on 7 July on the North-South and East-West Lines was caused by intermittent tripping of the power system at multiple locations. Chloride deposits, possibly exacerbated by a water leak in the tunnel, lowered the electrical resistance of a third rail insulator between Tanjong Pagar and Raffles Place stations. This allowed electricity to flow through the insulator to the ground and led to a higher than normal voltage difference between the running rail and the ground. Because the running rail is connected throughout the North-South and East-West Lines, the higher voltages would show up at multiple locations across the network. The movement of trains further elevated the voltages. When confronted with abnormal voltage, the 64P safety mechanism would be activated as a safety precaution. This safety mechanism is widely used in overseas systems such as Japan's, as well as in all our rail lines. In this instance, the safety mechanism was activated to trip the power at multiple locations across the two lines.",1,2,012-002-093-023-005-002,82

But, as a general rule, I would say that if there are design flaws, we are likely to see it pop up within three to five years or so of operating the line, rather than to see it come up 25 years or so after the start of operations. In the interim, SMRT is replacing all the third rail insulators. SMRT has also combed through the tunnels to ensure that there are no other leaks with water dripping onto trackside installations, and will be installing data loggers at all traction power substations within the next two months to better monitor the condition of the insulators. Lastly, we will be making the North-South and East-West Lines less susceptible to such power trips by increasing the touch voltage threshold for the 64P safety mechanism to levels similar to international standards, as well as the newer Circle and Downtown Lines.",3,4,012-002-093-023-005-004,84

One set had deteriorated more quickly than the other, even though it was installed later. Therefore, it is a little bit hard to give you a definitive time frame as to how long these sleepers can last because it depends on their conditions, the type of wood, how it is treated and a variety of different factors.

As to who bears the cost, there is a formulation, quite a complicated one in the original White Paper, which I do not intend to go into, but we had talked about this previously. Basically, the Government bears part of the cost of the replacement and renewal. But because we think that actually it could have lasted us longer if it was better maintained over the years; therefore you also take a discount from what the Government would otherwise have to pay.

I did some research on the SMRT website, and according to the FAQ section, the timber sleepers are supposed to last between 15 and 25 years. Can the Minister verify that this is the case? Does the operator replace the sleepers only when it reaches its end of life, or does it replace when it sees signs of wear and tear? Because if we count 15 to 25 years from 1987, the sleeper replacement ought to have been completed by 2002 or 2012. But according to SMRT, the sleeper replacement only started in November 2012 - this is the press statement that they issued - and it will not be completed until 2016. So, why was there such a long delay and who is responsible for this delay? And did the delay in sleeper replacements pose any risk to commuters' safety at any point?",1,10,012-002-093-023-005-010,90

Part of the reason why we initiated the upgrading of the signalling system was because we wanted to be able to run the trains at shorter headways. The current signalling system allows trains to operate at 120 seconds. The newer systems, including that in the North East Line, for example, will allow you to run trains at tighter intervals.

Yes, the body builders fell under the jurisdiction of the Anti-Doping Singapore (ADS), but since that incident, body building has been dropped from SNOC, meaning that body building no longer falls under the ADS' jurisdiction.

To an ordinary person, scientific experiments should be handled by the experts. It is like leaving personal problems such as medical subsidies and housing grants, or even social problems to the relevant agencies to deal with.

This is because no matter how society evolves, the ultimate purpose of all materials created is to serve us.",3,27,012-002-093-023-021-027,244
2015-08-18,Human Biomedical Research Bill,012-002-093-023-021,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"HBR can be a sensitive topic in the medical and social fields; it has something to do with our valuable life and social safety. Hence, many countries have introduced laws and regulations as well as moral codes to ensure the safety and legitimacy of HBR. Next, I would like to talk about the moral principles that HBR must follow.",4,28,012-002-093-023-021-028,245
2015-08-18,Human Biomedical Research Bill,012-002-093-023-021,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"First, be conducive to medical and social developments. HBR must be conducted with the sole purpose of studying the human biology, finding out why and how disease occurs, improving disease diagnosis, prevention and treatment, so that it can be a driver for the betterment of humanity's health and for the development of medicine and society. Each one of us should understand this. In Singapore, we live in a highly efficient, fast paced and materialistic society. People often focus on work efficacy and neglect the human touch by paying too much attention to results. The importance of the Bill lies in the fact that it reminds us that science experiment is for us to live happier and healthier, and the application of knowledge should go beyond knowledge accumulation.",5,29,012-002-093-023-021-029,246
2015-08-18,Human Biomedical Research Bill,012-002-093-023-021,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"Second, obtain informed consent from the research subject. Informed consent is a prerequisite of HBR.

2015-08-18,Human Biomedical Research Bill,012-002-093-023-021,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"It is worth emphasising that the researcher must inform the subject the purpose, method, expected benefits and the potential risk of the research, help him understand all these and answer his doubts. Only after the subject has agreed to participate voluntarily and signed a written consent can the HBR be performed on the subject. If the subject lacks or loses ability to make informed decision, the informed consent should be exercised by his family members, guardian or deputy.",7,31,012-002-093-023-021-031,248
2015-08-18,Human Biomedical Research Bill,012-002-093-023-021,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"Our society is ageing gradually and the speed of ageing is faster than many people's imagination. Based on observations at my own constituency, older Singaporeans do not have enough understanding of this issue, so we must provide legal protection for them to ensure that they know their rights when participating in any HBR, and to prevent the researchers from withholding risks or using the research results to obtain inappropriate commercial gains. Another group that needs to be protected is the mentally disabled. The law must ensure that their family or guardian know how to protect their rights.",8,32,012-002-093-023-021-032,249
2015-08-18,Human Biomedical Research Bill,012-002-093-023-021,Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang),"Third, protect the rights of the research subject. The rights of the research subject refer to the physical and psychological safety of the subject during HBR. The researcher must have sufficient scientific evidence to show that it has no evident harm to animals before it can be conducted on humans. During the entire process of HBR, there must be sufficient safeguards. If situation arises when the interests of the subject could be severely harmed, then HBR must stop immediately and effective measures must be taken to minimise the negative impact on the subject physically and psychologically.",9,33,012-002-093-023-021-033,250

For example, we all know that our law currently forbids organ and blood trade, but it is ambiguous towards human tissue. This could be a potential legal loophole. The new Bill clearly states that the trading of human tissue is forbidden. The purpose is to prevent the trading of any part of the human body and to protect the vulnerable groups from becoming the criminals' money-making tool.",11,35,012-002-093-023-021-035,252

With the rapid change of our society in so many areas, social cohesion will face grave challenges.

2015-08-18,Human Biomedical Research Bill,012-002-093-023-021,The Minister of State for Health,"In the case of multi-centre research done locally, Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef has correctly pointed out that the Bill provides for our local research institutions to come together and appoint a lead institution amongst themselves, to coordinate the research they are collaborating on. The Bill also enables the collaborating institutions to appoint the same IRB to review their joint research, which would be more efficient than having multiple IRBs review the same research protocol. However, having such an arrangement does not mean that the lead institution will take over the responsibilities of all the other participating research institutions. Each research institution will still be accountable for ensuring that there is good governance in place for safe and ethical conduct of those parts of the research under its purview.",4,41,012-002-093-023-021-041,258
2015-08-18,Human Biomedical Research Bill,012-002-093-023-021,The Minister of State for Health,"Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef also asked about the impact of the Bill on international multi-centre research. For research institutions and researchers in Singapore involved in international research collaborations, this Bill will apply to them. Most of the existing international research projects that are already ongoing are not expected to face much difficulty meeting the requirements of this Bill, especially if they involve collaborations with partner institutions in developed countries. This is because the key requirements in this Bill, such as informed consent, independent ethics review and a clear framework of accountability and governance, are already the norm in developed countries. These requirements also should already be familiar to researchers in Singapore.",5,42,012-002-093-023-021-042,259
2015-08-18,Human Biomedical Research Bill,012-002-093-023-021,The Minister of State for Health,"However, not all countries have specific laws governing human biomedical research, or impose similar, if any, regulatory and ethical requirements. In situations where the same international protocol calls for research activities to be conducted in both Singapore as well as overseas, the local research institution will, of course, be responsible for the research activities in Singapore. Additionally, the local research institution will need to ensure that its appointed IRB reviews and approves that protocol in its entirety, and not just the portion of the research activities in Singapore. On its part, the IRB will need to be satisfied that the international protocol complies with the national laws of all the participating institutions as well as internationally-accepted ethical principles. This is to prevent research institutions from evading the requirements of the Bill by circumscribing the scope of their research activities in Singapore to only those that are lawful under this Bill, while conducting research that is unethical or even prohibited or restricted under the Bill overseas.",6,43,012-002-093-023-021-043,260
2015-08-18,Human Biomedical Research Bill,012-002-093-023-021,The Minister of State for Health,"An example of such a case was reported in the international media in October 1997, involving a multi-centre clinical trial conducted in the US, Africa and Thailand, to test a new treatment for HIV/AIDS. In that research protocol, test subjects in the control group in Africa were unethically given only a placebo, even though an existing HIV/AIDS treatment was available. In contrast, test subjects in the control group in the US were given the existing HIV/AIDS treatment. The differential treatment of the test subjects in different countries caused an international outcry against the unethical behaviour of the researchers. It is research like this which we should guard against and avoid participating in, if we are to safeguard Singapore's reputation as a world-class biomedical research centre.",7,44,012-002-093-023-021-044,261
2015-08-18,Human Biomedical Research Bill,012-002-093-023-021,The Minister of State for Health,"Regarding Mrs Lina Chiam's suggestion to have a central IRB, there are three key factors MOH considered when deciding not to adopt a central IRB system. Firstly, a central IRB will not have the same degree of knowledge and familiarity with the adequacy of the RI's systems of oversight, compared to an IRB that is more closely connected to the RI. This could adversely affect the central IRB's ability to effectively monitor the RIs or to effectively assess and approve individual research protocols and ensure the safety and welfare of research subjects.",8,45,012-002-093-023-021-045,262

2015-08-18,Human Biomedical Research Bill,012-002-093-023-021,The Minister of State for Health,"Thirdly, the workload and responsibility of the central IRB is likely to be relatively greater, which may dissuade persons from coming forward to serve as members. Centralisation of the IRB reviews would also adversely affect their responsiveness. While Mrs Chiam had suggested that the members be paid a full-time salary, this may create an undesirable situation where board members no longer serve voluntarily but expect to be paid based on the volume of research protocols reviewed. This will not be conducive to conscientious and meaningful review of research protocols, unlike the current framework, where IRB members do not receive any salary or wages to review the research proposals, and at most receive a modest honorarium.",10,47,012-002-093-023-021-047,264
2015-08-18,Human Biomedical Research Bill,012-002-093-023-021,The Minister of State for Health,"Concerns have been raised that the IRB may have excessively broad powers, particularly the ability to waive the appropriate consent requirements when researchers conduct their HBR. I would like to reiterate that only the IRB as a body, and not just the chair alone, may waive the appropriate consent requirements of the Bill if it is satisfied that all the criteria in paragraph 3 (Part 2) of the Fifth Schedule are satisfied, namely  the individually-identifiable human biological material or health information research, as the case may be, may not practicably be carried out unless there is a waiver; the use of the individually-identifiable human biological material or health information, as the case may be, involves no more than minimal risk to the research subject or donor; the waiver concerned will not otherwise adversely affect the rights and welfare of the research subject or donor; and the human biomedical research or health information research would reasonably be considered to contribute to the greater public good.",11,48,012-002-093-023-021-048,265

I would just like to confirm with the Minister of State the question I asked on clause 63 with regard to the penalty threshold of the $20,000 fine and a two-year imprisonment term.

2015-08-18,Human Biomedical Research Bill,012-002-093-023-021,Dr Lam Pin Min,"  I would like to thank the Member for the question. The penalties for HBR vary depending on the severity of the offence and this is consistent with other Singapore laws, for example, the Human Cloning and Other Prohibited Practices Act and the Human Organ Transplant Act. In fact, if you look at the penalty regime, there are basically four tiers to it. The highest being what we call the type 1A kind of offence which warrants a penalty of $100,000 and/or 10 years of imprisonment. With regard to what Mr Pritam Singh has queried - which is with reference to clause 63 - the penalty prescribed is a maximum of $20,000 and/or two years of imprisonment. This is actually quite consistent if you compare to other equivalent provisions in other Acts. In fact, if you look at some of the other Acts, the penalty imposed in HBR is a little bit more stringent rather than more lax, as mentioned by Mr Pritam Singh.",1,110,012-002-093-023-021-110,327

2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),The Bus Services Industry Bill seeks to establish the legislative framework for a contracting model for public bus services. Allow me to briefly re-cap why we are moving to a contracting model.,2,3,012-002-093-023-022-003,349
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"Bus services are a key pillar of our public transport system. Every day, about half of our public transport trips, or over 3.7 million trips, are taken on a public bus. Under today's framework, SBS Transit and SMRT Buses are issued ten-year licences by the Public Transport Council (PTC) to operate public bus services. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) plans the bus routes. The operators determine how many buses to operate on these routes according to ridership needs and the regulatory service standards set by the PTC.",3,4,012-002-093-023-022-004,350
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"This framework has generally served Singapore well. We have maintained a reasonably good level of bus services while keeping fares low. This is largely because the bus operators are careful about cost, as they have to cover their capital and operating expenses through revenue collected, in particular fares. The flip side of this, however, is that operators have tended to be slow to respond to changing travel demand and expectations, and to increase capacity and improve service standards.",4,5,012-002-093-023-022-005,351
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"Hence, last year, my Ministry announced that the bus industry would be restructured to a contracting model from 2016. Under this model, LTA owns the buses, determines the standard of bus services to be provided, and tenders out the contracts to run them. The contracting model will enable the Government to respond more expeditiously to changes in travel demand. Competitive tendering also means that bus operators have to compete for the right to run bus services, which will raise bus service quality in a cost-competitive manner, thereby benefitting commuters.",5,6,012-002-093-023-022-006,352
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"This Bill will provide the legislative framework for LTA's new role as the contractor of public bus services. It will also transfer the powers to regulate the bus services industry from the PTC to LTA. The planning, contracting and regulatory functions for public bus services will henceforth all reside within LTA, which will enable us to streamline processes and manage bus services more holistically. The Bill will also consolidate the regulation of bus services, bus depots and bus interchanges within one Act, to provide a clearer regulatory framework for bus operators and potential bidders for public bus services contracts.",6,7,012-002-093-023-022-007,353
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"Mdm Speaker, I will now describe the key provisions in the Bus Services Industry Bill. Part 2 of the Bill sets out a bus services procurement framework that enables LTA to enter into contracts with bus operators to run public bus services planned by the LTA. These include both feeder and trunk services, as well as services such as the City Direct Services. Clause 7 sets out the content of public bus services contracts, such as the duration of the contract, and the performance standards to be met by the public bus operators. Clause 8 enables LTA to enforce these contractual performance standards.",7,8,012-002-093-023-022-008,354
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"Part 3 of the Bill empowers LTA to license bus operators and impose conditions on licensees to safeguard commuter interests. Clause 11 requires any person who wishes to operate a bus service for a fare, on a pre-determined timetable, and on a fixed route for journeys with two or more bus stopping points in Singapore, to apply for a licence. Similar to the current licensing framework under PTC, there will be two classes of licences. A Class 1 bus service licence, similar to the Bus Service Operator's Licence today, is for the operation of a package of ten or more services. A Class 2 bus service licence, similar to today's Bus Service Licence, is for the operation of a single bus service.",8,9,012-002-093-023-022-009,355
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"Clause 13 sets out the considerations when LTA assesses licence applications, such as the applicant's financial capability to operate the services. Clause 15 sets out the conditions which LTA may impose in the licences. Both licence classes include conditions pertaining to the safety and security of passengers, and the requirement to provide a performance bond or other financial security as needed.",9,10,012-002-093-023-022-010,356

2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"Let me explain in more detail how the two classes of licences apply. Class 1 bus service licences will be required by the major bus operators that serve a large number of commuters. These include the operators for all the twelve packages of public bus services that LTA will be tendering out over time – SBS Transit, SMRT Buses, Tower Transit Singapore, and any other operators that win the tenders for the other bus packages. While the Class 2 bus service licences, on the other hand, are required by private bus operators and operators of individual public bus services like the City Direct Services.",11,12,012-002-093-023-022-012,358
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"Accordingly, the Bill places more stringent qualifying criteria and obligations on Class 1 bus service licensees versus the licensees in Class 2. For example, clause 19 requires Class 1 bus service licence holders to seek LTA's approval in appointing or removing their chief executive officer, chairman of its board of directors, or any of its directors, to ensure that public bus service operators have a competent leadership and board able to discharge their responsibilities.",12,13,012-002-093-023-022-013,359
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"Part 4 of the Bill sets out the licensing regime for bus depot and interchange operators, and is largely similar to the provisions under the Road Traffic Act today. Clause 24 sets out the considerations that LTA must consider in granting the licences, while Clause 26 allows LTA to impose conditions relating to the level of service, operation, safety and security of bus interchanges and depots.",13,14,012-002-093-023-022-014,360
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"Part 5 of the Bill sets out step-in arrangements when a Class 1 bus service operator, bus depot operator, or bus interchange operator, is no longer able to continue operating the services. Clause 30 enables the Minister for Transport to make a step-in order when the licence in question is suspended, revoked or surrendered; or if the public bus services contract is terminated or suspended; and it is in LTA's opinion then necessary to take over the operations of the licensee. The step-in order will authorise LTA to directly take over, or to contract a step-in operator to take over the operations, and require the licensee to facilitate the handover of the operations.",14,15,012-002-093-023-022-015,361

2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"I will now highlight some of the consequential amendments in other Acts. Parts IV and IVA of the Public Transport Council Act which license bus services and bus service operators, and Part VB of the Road Traffic Act which licenses bus depot and bus interchange operators, will be repealed as the powers will have been consolidated under LTA with this Bill, as I earlier explained. LTA will also be vested with the function to operate any bus service, bus depot or bus interchange under the Land Transport Authority of Singapore Act, to enable LTA to be a step-in operator if necessary.",16,17,012-002-093-023-022-017,363
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"Finally, to ensure a seamless change of regulatory authority from PTC to LTA, and in consolidating all bus regulatory roles in LTA, Clause 55 sets out savings and transitional provisions for subsisting licences under the PTC Act and Road Traffic Act. Existing licences will retain their existing terms and conditions until expiry. The licensee will only have to renew its licence upon expiry, and only then will the new licence terms and conditions apply.",17,18,012-002-093-023-022-018,364
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"In summary, Mdm Speaker, this Bill accords LTA regulatory oversight over bus service, bus depot and bus interchange operators. The proposed framework enables us to transition the public bus industry to a contracting model, where the Government would be able to more holistically plan the transport network, and respond in a more timely manner to changing travel needs. All of these eventually lead back to our ultimate goal, which is, to better serve public transport commuters in Singapore. With that, Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.",18,19,012-002-093-023-022-019,365

Now, the Government has introduced a relevant Bill for the bus services industry, bringing in the competitive tendering process. This is a good start. Moreover, the Bill specifies that the tendering process will adopt a ""two-envelope"" mechanism. The service quality proposed by the tendering party will be evaluated first before financial indicators are considered. This selection procedure would avoid giving the tender to the operator who lowers the bid by sacrificing quality in order to win. Eventually this will benefit all public commuters.",3,32,012-002-093-023-022-032,378

This would present a great challenge to the operators of current bus services, school bus services, logistics services, etc. The manpower shortage in local drivers is a chronic problem and, in fact, it was found that bus drivers of other nationalities find it hard to adapt. Thus I hope that LTA and WDA could cooperate to provide professional skills training for the transport industry, especially for bus operators, in order to develop more manpower resource channels and enable those who are willing to have a career change to become qualified bus drivers.",6,35,012-002-093-023-022-035,381

I urge local industry players to take this opportunity to review their management processes, strengthen the bonding among workers, and think of ways, other than through pay hikes, to retain key employees.

I would like pay tribute to the outgoing Minister, Mr Lui Tuck Yew, for doing such a formidable job in the past four and a half years. Under his leadership, bus services have improved tremendously with the Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP). Bus services will improve further with the Bus Services Industry Bill. The results of the train services are not as outstanding, marred mainly by the recent breakdown of North-South and East-West lines. Nonetheless, Downtown Lines 1 and 2 have been largely completed under Mr Lui's tight supervision. My focus today, however, is on the bus services. Mdm Speaker, please allow me to speak in Mandarin.</span>",1,57,012-002-093-023-022-057,403

I was very curious, so I asked one of the bus captains who said such things, how long had he been driving public buses. He replied, ""Over 30 years."" I immediately asked him, ""So, you have been driving public buses for over 30 years. Are you still a human being?"" He shrugged his shoulders, shook his head and said, ""No choice!"" Then he walked away.",2,58,012-002-093-023-022-058,404

2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"(In English)  Mdm Speaker, one of the most important parts of the Bus Services Industry Bill is Part 5, the step-in arrangements. Clause 30 of the Bill allows the Minister to issue a step-in order when a company operating the public bus services under the Government Contracting Model (GCM) fails repeatedly to perform up to the standards required by the public bus services contract. The step-in right is an important lever to ensure that the Public Transport Operator (PTO) performs adequately or risks getting its licence suspended or revoked. At the same time, it allows the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to take over the bus operations or appoint another bus operator to operate the bus services so that commuters will not be too adversely affected by the step-in actions. For that matter, allow me to digress from my speech a little to state my position pertaining to the operator who has won the first bus package under the GCM.",4,60,012-002-093-023-022-060,406
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"A foreign bus operator, Tower Transit, has won the first bus package to operate buses from Jurong East and Bukit Batok interchanges. As a Member of Parliament for Jurong GRC, I sincerely urge Tower Transit to live up to its expectations of providing quality bus services as required under the GCM. Otherwise, the residents of Jurong GRC will suffer.",5,61,012-002-093-023-022-061,407
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Under what circumstances would a PTO fail to perform? There could be many factors, such as financial strength of the PTO, mismanagement of bus operations, not enough bus drivers, and so on. From my experience, one of the biggest risk factors is the ability to attract drivers, commonly known as Bus Captains or BCs in short in the industry. This is because of our tight labour market and the requirements by the Ministry of Manpower to build a Singaporean core in the bus industry.",6,62,012-002-093-023-022-062,408
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"When I first took over the role of managing bus operations, overseeing a fleet of more than 1,500 buses and 3,000 Bus Captains, I had a dream. I dreamt that one day, there would be a long queue of people wanting to join the rank of a Bus Captain. Today, my dream has come true. There is indeed a long queue of people waiting to join the Bus Captain profession but they are mainly Malaysians due to the low ringgit exchange rate. One Singapore dollar is worth $2.90 ringgit or thereabout, today.",7,63,012-002-093-023-022-063,409
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"However, not enough Singaporeans would like to become Bus Captains, even though we have increased Singaporean Bus Captain's pay four times over the last five years. Today, the Bus Captain's basic pay is 48% more than that in 2010. Today, a new Singaporean Bus Captain with more than one year of driving experience earns slightly above $3,000 per month on average, not including bonuses. Yet, today, the proportion of local Bus Captains as a percentage of the total number of Bus Captains is significantly lower as compared to the figure five years ago. In fact, the drop is more than 10%.",8,64,012-002-093-023-022-064,410

2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),Why do Singaporeans shy away from being a Bus Captain?,10,66,012-002-093-023-022-066,412
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"There are three main reasons, among others. Firstly, the working hours of Bus Captains. A Bus Captain has to drive the bus to send people to work and back to home every day. The first bus service leaves the bus interchange as early as 5.00 am on a daily basis. The last bus service, when it ends the last trip at the bus interchange, could reach the bus depot as late as 2.00 am. This means that the morning shift Bus Captain has to reach the depot to collect the bus in the morning as early as 4.30 am and it also means that he has to wake up as early as 3.00 am. I know it is tough as I often join the Bus Captains for breakfast at 4.30 am in the morning. It is an unearthly hour to many Singaporeans. For those Bus Captains who are doing afternoon shifts, they would probably reach home at about 3.00 am, or even later. That is, when most Singaporeans are sleeping in the morning, the Bus Captains are getting ready the buses for you. At night, when most Singaporeans are asleep, the Bus Captains are still busy keeping their buses.",11,67,012-002-093-023-022-067,413
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Secondly, the road safety hazards. As mentioned by the Minister for Transport, buses are not yet the ""kings of the road"". Many motorists take advantage of slower speed of the buses and cut into their lane of the buses, and especially when the cars are turning left at junctions. Motorists also hardly give way to buses coming out from bus bays or, worse still, illegally cut into bus lanes to pick-up and drop off car passengers at or near the bus stops, thereby causing obstruction to the buses. The longest bus route, service 51, takes about almost three hours to travel from Hougang to Jurong East bus interchange. Such a long driving duration without rest, take a toll on the Bus Captains.",12,68,012-002-093-023-022-068,414
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Thirdly, Singaporeans' attitude towards Bus Captains. A Bus Captain, not only has to drive passenger from point A to point B safely, he also has to provide good customer service, greet, smile and say ""Thank You"". Most passengers are nice but there is a handful that can spoil the mood of the Bus Captains. For example, some passengers are so distracted by their mobile phones and forget to wave for the bus at the bus stop. Instead of acknowledging their mistake, they often blame Bus Captains for not stopping at the bus stop for them. When on the bus, some passengers are also too fixated on their mobile phones and forget to press the bell. Again, such passengers tend to blame the Bus Captains for not stopping at the bus stop. Others try to evade or underpay the bus fare and get caught by the Bus Captains, and often blame the Bus Captains for being rude when performing fare enforcement. More commonly, a significant number of passengers are reluctant to move to the rear of the bus despite repeated reminders, resulting in others failing to get on the bus, and Bus Captains end up getting the blame again. Today, there is not enough respect for the Bus Captains generally.",13,69,012-002-093-023-022-069,415
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"With the BSEP, LTA will inject 1,000 buses on the road by 2017 which means we will need an additional 2,500 bus captains to operate the additional 1,000 buses. With the transition to GCM provided under the Bus Services Industry Bill, we could expect an even higher bus service standard which means more Bus Captains are required. How do we build a Singaporean core in the bus industry? Or is a Bus Captain's job so unearthly that the majority of the Singaporeans will forever shy away from driving public buses?",14,70,012-002-093-023-022-070,416
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"I do not think so. If you look at Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea, most of their Bus Captains are local residents. If they can do it, I believe we can as well. That is provided the various Government agencies could coordinate and put their act together. How do we build a Singaporean core in the bus industry?",15,71,012-002-093-023-022-071,417
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"One, we need to improve the remuneration of Bus Captains, similar to what the Government has done for nurses and staff of other essential services. The current average gross monthly pay of Bus Captain at about $3,000-plus is comparable to that of taxi drivers and other driving professions. However, we could only attract 76 Singaporeans to join us as Bus Captains in 2014 as compared to more than 1,000 Malaysians who joined as Bus Captains last year. Seventy-six Singaporeans versus 1,000 Malaysians joined us last year as Bus Captains. This shows that a higher premium would be needed to convince Singaporeans to join the Bus Captain's profession given the unearthly working hours and demands of being a Bus Captain. The GCM allows this to happen as the Government is prepared to provide a higher level of subsidies under this model.",16,72,012-002-093-023-022-072,418
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Two, we need to improve the working conditions for Bus Captains. It is very hard to change the working hours of the Bus Captains but we can change other working conditions for the Bus Captains. For example, I urge Land Transport Authority to build better facilities at the bus interchanges for the Bus Captains to rest properly. I have the opportunity to visit the train stations and compare them with the bus interchanges. The newer train lines work on driverless systems. That is, there are no train drivers. Yet, the staff's rest area at a train station can be up to five times the size of the rest area in a bus interchange. So the train station has no drivers but has big rest area, whereas bus interchange has hundreds of bus drivers but has small rest area. Both facilities are built by the Land Transport Authority – so why the discrepancy? One eye big, one eye small? No wonder people in the bus industry have been complaining that the bus is a poor cousin of the train. One consolation is that the newer bus interchanges have bigger staff's rest area but not the older ones.",17,73,012-002-093-023-022-073,419
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Some argue that the train is the backbone of the public transport and that is why train facilities deserve better treatment. The bus ridership in 2014 was 3.8 million per day as compared to the train ridership of 2.8 million. Many think that when train network eventually expands from 178 km today to 380 km in 2030, the ridership on the train network would exceed that of the bus. This may not be so. In London today, given the extensive train network, the bus ridership is still much higher than the train ridership. There were 2.4 billion bus passenger journeys as compared to 1.3 billion London underground train journeys in 2013/2014 Financial Year. So, in London, the bus ridership today is still much higher than the train ridership. This shows that the bus service will remain an important part of the public transport in many years to come. Thus, it is important for LTA to invest more to provide better bus infrastructure. On the same note, I urge the next Minister for Transport to take advice from the current Minister, to implement more bus priority schemes so as to make buses the real ""kings of the road"".",18,74,012-002-093-023-022-074,420
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Three, we need to improve the image of the Bus Captains. In 2003, SBS Transit collaborated with MediaCorp to produce a drama series called, ""She Drives Me Crazy"".",19,75,012-002-093-023-022-075,421

However, the series can only educate people to understand the work nature of a Bus Captain; it cannot attract Singaporeans to join the profession in a longer term.",20,76,012-002-093-023-022-076,422
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),(In English)  The Chinese comedy drama did stir up some interest on the roles of Bus Captain but did little to attract more Singaporeans to join the profession. We need more than profiling of the Bus Captains. We need an overhaul of the Bus Captains' image. We need to attract more ITE graduates and encourage more mid-career Singaporeans to join the Bus Captain profession.,21,77,012-002-093-023-022-077,423
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Under the GCM, the bus operators are merely contractors. With more players entering the fray under the GCM, none of them, in fact, will have sufficient influence to raise the profile of the Bus Captains. Hence, I urge the Ministry of Transport to take a larger role in this area. I understand that Senior Minister of State Mrs Josephine Teo is chairing a tripartite committee and one of the objectives of the committee is to raise the professionalism of Bus Captains. It was mentioned by the Minister of Transport yesterday in his response to a Parliamentary Question. At the same time, I hope Singaporeans at large could also give their due respect to the Bus Captains.",22,78,012-002-093-023-022-078,424
2015-08-18,Bus Services Industry Bill,012-002-093-023-022,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"In conclusion, I reckon that with the concerted effort by the various parties under the GCM provided by clause 6 of the Bill, there is hope that the bus captains' remuneration and working conditions could improve and convince more Singaporeans to consider the job of a Bus Captain as an attractive career option.",23,79,012-002-093-023-022-079,425

LTA will carry out audits to ensure compliance. It will also deduct from their service fee for failure to meet these KPIs. When operators transit, they will be responsible to make good any shortfalls to buses that are found not road-worthy or not fit for operational purposes. On the point of asset renewal and replacement, this is LTA's responsibility. Likewise, for condition surveys on depots and interchanges. The slew of assets from buses to depots and interchanges will be the responsibility of LTA to renew and to replace while the onus is on the operators to make sure that the conditions are met and the maintenance is carried out as required.",7,88,012-002-093-023-022-088,434

I am glad to share that LTA, in consultation with the National Transport Workers' Union, has been building bus depots and interchanges with better facilities and rest areas to improve the welfare of Bus Captains and staff. We will, as much as possible, try to retrofit some of these newer standards into the existing interchanges and depots. But for the newer built ones, for example, the new Bulim bus depot, we have enhanced the crew rest areas, staff lounges and canteens, and even for temporary interchanges, like the one in Yishun, we have built bigger staff lounges, a canteen and dedicated staff toilet facilities.",15,96,012-002-093-023-022-096,442

I would like to share with Mr Gan that LTA has emphasised the importance for operators to develop a strong Singaporean core within its operations, and has required operators to commit to base locally any non-Singaporean management staff that is overseeing bus service operations for the entire duration of the contract.

The Public Transport Council (Amendment) Bill seeks to amend the Public Transport Council Act in three key areas to support developments in public transport. First, it will institutionalise the new role of the Public Transport Council, or PTC, in advising the Minister for Transport on public transport matters. Second, it will formalise the Fare Review Mechanism Committee's recommendations in 2013, which the Government had accepted. And third, it will empower PTC to standardise the taxi fare structure.

As an outcome of that, we see more taxis now having a hirer and a relief driver, which means that the taxis are more intensively used, not that the drivers need to drive more. But because there is a hirer and a relief driver, the taxis are more intensively used, and we have seen the percentage of taxis on the roads increase from 82% to 90% during the peak hours.

Actually, the operators do not do that. They do not contribute to the Government; they contribute to the Public Transport Fund. In the past, MOT was managing the contributions as well as working with the People's Association (PA) to disburse the Public Transport Vouchers. It will continue to be so after the legislative amendments. It is just the legal requirement to have it, now that it is no longer a voluntary contribution by the operators, but a mandatory contribution that the Public Transport Council imposes on the operators. So, let me assure you that there is no intention to increase headcount to continue to manage such a fund.",7,49,012-002-093-023-023-049,501

We will continue to do so, including the experiment that we are now doing, the Beeline service which allows people to crowdsource, group their requirements, and then make their own arrangements for buses to serve them and provide a direct point-to-point transfer to their destinations.

The CADF is not intended for such purposes as it is meant to fund the expansion of Changi Airport. Its uses are circumscribed. It has to be related to the expansion of Changi Airport and the related acquisition of capital assets to support the operation of the expanded airport.

The first is whether it would be prudent for us to conduct more detailed feasibility studies before embarking on the building of Terminal 5. That is exactly what we are doing, whether you term it as feasibility studies or detailed design studies. At this stage, we are doing land preparation works, but we have not started constructing Terminal 5. We are at the design stage. And it is precisely at this design stage that we will look at the needs of an air hub of the future, in particular, how we can maintain a very high level of service standards and, at the same time, increase the productivity of the manpower that we will need to operate Terminal 5.",4,33,012-002-093-023-024-033,540
2015-08-18,Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-023-024,Mrs Josephine Teo,"From what I can understand, Mrs Chiam has expressed the concern as to whether we are rushing into things. From the design stage to the construction stage to the testing stage, to the operation stage of a terminal of the scale of Terminal 5, it would easily take 10 years. So, we are talking about a terminal that could, at the very earliest, be operational in the middle of the next decade. It is not too early at all to start now if we want to have something available to us in the mid-2020s, because that is when we project that the capacity of Changi Airport even with the enhanced capacity of Terminal 4 and Terminal 1 will be almost fully utilised. We have to get this infrastructure ready; otherwise we will be behind time. So, it is not a hasty decision. This has been thought about for a long time and we have to get down to building up Terminal 5. There is actually no more time to lose, in my view.",5,34,012-002-093-023-024-034,541
2015-08-18,Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-023-024,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The second point is  why set up a dedicated fund, the CADF? You already have Reinvestment Fund, why not use it to pay for the Airport development? Two things  one is that for something as important and as long term as air hub development, you really need to have the certainty of funds, whereas the nature of the Reinvestment Fund is that it is subject to competition every year. Every cycle, Ministries, statutory boards, if they have a good idea, will have to compete for Reinvestment Fund, it is not assured funding. Until it becomes a programme that is proven, it does not enter into a specific Ministry's funding and you use Reinvestment Fund for that purpose. That is one reason.",6,35,012-002-093-023-024-035,542
2015-08-18,Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-023-024,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The second reason is that given the amount we expect to be needed for Changi Airport's development, it is not possible for the entire amount to be met by the total size of the Reinvestment Fund. There is just not going to be enough of it.",7,36,012-002-093-023-024-036,543
2015-08-18,Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-023-024,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The third point the Member raised is whether in a dedicated set-up like the CADF, it becomes possible for the rules of prudence and good governance to be circumvented? The answer is no. The use of the fund is circumscribed. That is why we are coming to Parliament to expressly lay out the uses of the fund. Even in the disbursements and in terms of the commitments that can be met by the fund, these will be subject to all the usual rules that we have implemented within the public sector. Bearing in mind that this fund will be administered by the CAAS which is a statutory board, the same rules that apply to all other projects they fund will apply to the projects funded out of the CADF as well.",8,37,012-002-093-023-024-037,544
