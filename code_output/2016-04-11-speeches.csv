2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head M (Ministry of Finance),013-001-094-016-002,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),There is scope to enhance our procurement practices towards promoting innovation among our SMEs while at the same time delivering value for money for the public sector.,3,3,013-001-094-016-002-003,6
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head M (Ministry of Finance),013-001-094-016-002,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"As a start, the public sector could earmark a portion of the public sector tenders specifically to promote and encourage innovations and creativity. I suggest that the Government establish a new ""buy innovation"" procurement framework where innovative solutions are being sought for public sector problems. This could be a new category of tenders carved out for projects where the public sector agencies intend to co-create solutions with SMEs.",4,4,013-001-094-016-002-004,7

2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head M (Ministry of Finance),013-001-094-016-002,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Mdm Chair, at the public service level, our procurement rules and instruction manuals may also need to be reviewed and updated to cater for a more entrepreneurial and innovative society to come. We need to allow for sufficient discretions at the operating level for bite-size public sector projects to be awarded to small businesses who may be early movers or who are proactive in coming up with innovative solutions that the public agencies are looking for. Subjecting every proposal to an open tender would be the surest way to kill off initiative and creativity among the small businesses, and some could be start-ups.",6,6,013-001-094-016-002-006,9

2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head M (Ministry of Finance),013-001-094-016-002,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"We can take a leaf from UK. To help SMEs develop innovative solutions to public sector challenges, the UK government established the Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI) specifically to help small companies compete for government projects. The SBRI help connect small businesses to government departments who have public sector problems and assist small businesses come up with innovative solutions and ideas.

2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head M (Ministry of Finance),013-001-094-016-002,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"However, upon deeper study into details in the CI Partnership website, it seems that this scheme has turned dormant. Despite being a $450-million scheme, only 28 projects were put up since 2011 with no mentions of any take up. One of the criteria mentioned that during the commercialisation phase, the agency may need to call for an open tender to procure the innovative product or service.",12,12,013-001-094-016-002-012,15

2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head M (Ministry of Finance),013-001-094-016-002,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),We should introduce greater flexibilities in the way the government sector procures goods and services including looking at non-traditional safeguards to ensure value for money.,16,16,013-001-094-016-002-016,19

This is win-win for the Government and businesses.",17,17,013-001-094-016-002-017,20
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head M (Ministry of Finance),013-001-094-016-002,Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied),"   Madam, I would like to call on the Government to look into encouraging the increased use of price-adjustment clauses or escalation clauses in government procurement. These clauses provide that should some key costs in government contracts rise significantly form the time of tender to the time of performance or over a long period of performance, then the contract price will escalate in accordance with some pre-agreed formula, typically with reference to an index. This would protect the contractor from having to assume the risk of sharp increases in key costs. This will also benefit the Government in that their contractors will be under less pressure to over-budget when they bid for a contract and build into their bids their estimates for future cost increases.",1,18,013-001-094-016-002-018,21
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head M (Ministry of Finance),013-001-094-016-002,Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied),"Escalation clauses need not be used only to protect the contractors when the costs go up. They can also be used to favour the Government when key costs drop, say commodity or oil prices. They can provide that in such cases, the contract price to be paid by the Government will decrease accordingly.",2,19,013-001-094-016-002-019,22
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head M (Ministry of Finance),013-001-094-016-002,Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied),"In this way, escalation clauses remove some financial risks for government contractors and may enable or allow SMEs to punch above their weight in more public tenders. To me, this would be in keeping with the spirit of this year's Budget, in the various forms of financing and tax incentives proposed to support the scale-ups of our SMEs.",3,20,013-001-094-016-002-020,23

Let us start from the ideation process. With many sectors in the broad-base industry, each sector has its unique characteristics and needs. To enhance and find areas of synergy, it is pertinent for the different sectors to provide insights and champion ideas that they believe would put our industries on better footing at the global stage.",3,24,013-001-094-016-002-024,27
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head M (Ministry of Finance),013-001-094-016-002,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),The Ministry should provide platforms for such collective ideas to take shape.

It may also cost us more since additional resources has to be injected at later stage because the process is more of a ""push"" than a ""pull"" process.",12,33,013-001-094-016-002-033,36
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head M (Ministry of Finance),013-001-094-016-002,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),Assurance is also necessary that the push for such electronic service delivery within Government agencies does not result in lesser clarity of ownership on the issues or become a revolving door.,13,34,013-001-094-016-002-034,37
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head M (Ministry of Finance),013-001-094-016-002,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan),"Second, how does digitalisation change our behaviour towards the auditing, security and data protection processes in organisations? As it stands, many organisations already have different forms of operating systems and databases that they use to handle the operational tasks. However, the regular audit process still requires massive amount of manual backend paper work, filing and keeping of records in order for all these audits to take place.",14,35,013-001-094-016-002-035,38

So, I would encourage that the Government creates a unified base system structure where existing data can be shared across the different agencies.

Care-givers are becoming a vulnerable group themselves while they care for their vulnerable loved ones. They face emotional stress, lack of social support and immediate and long-term financial burdens.

The Medisave Top-Up scheme also looks at the home annual value. The PSEA which is the entitlement for all post-Secondary school education students, likewise, does the same, as does the CDAC top-up.

Many of them are likely to be elderly; they have inherited their homes or acquired it many years ago and have lived in this home all their lives. They may live in a property which has good annual value, but they are cash poor.

So, in this case, as Parliament opened at the beginning of the calendar year in January, we had a very heavy parliamentary schedule, and so, the Government's Budget was presented on 24 March 2016, taking into account the President's Address and the debate on the proposed policies as well as programmes of the Government in January. The Supply Bill 2016, can therefore only be passed by Parliament and enacted after the start of our financial year, and under the Order Paper, Parliament is currently scheduled to vote on the Bill after the end of COS on 14 April 2016. Once passed, the Bill would be submitted to the President for assent before it can be enacted as the Supply Law.

Just last month, we ran a ""Game Writing vs Narrative Design Masterclass"", in partnership with NTUC and the National Book Development Council. About 40 media and literary professionals came together to learn about game writing techniques and tools to develop game stories. We will launch more programmes later this year, such as the WritersLab, to hone scriptwriting for television.",26,116,013-001-094-016-003-116,317

The games sub-sector is one of the fastest growing media sectors in Singapore. The GSC offers budding game developers mentorship programmes, support for them to take their business and ideas overseas as well as business networking and access to financing opportunities. In fact, in just five years, the GSC has benefited close to 50 Singaporean game companies, of which, three-quarters have successfully completed games or game demos with more than 20 commercial game releases. In addition, more than five of them have gone on to secure seed funding from about $100,000 to $2 million.",28,118,013-001-094-016-003-118,319

It will help facilitate collaboration between various media sub-sectors to bring about richer consumer experiences. For example, game developers today use data to better understand their consumers. This capability can be shared more widely to other media professionals, so that they can develop more innovative ways to commercialise their content.

I never thought much about Public Service Broadcasting until I thought about how we can use it to help disrupt the poverty cycle here. In the 1980s, two psychologists investigated why Head Start, America's program for uplifting poor children, was having limited success. They discovered that richer parents spend more time reading and talking with their children than poorer parents do. That means by the time both the poor kid and the rich kid hit four years old, there is a 32-million word gap that exists between them.

It can come from as far as from Northeast Asia, across the Pacific from America.

2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head Q (Ministry of Communications and Information),013-001-094-016-003,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"   I have a question for the Minister of State. In my speech earlier, I spoke about the possibility of expanding PSB to include other new players. I just want to ask whether the Ministry is considering that or in dialogue with any new players and whether it is considering bringing new players. Would independent broadcasters or providers also be included if they meet certain requirements?",1,356,013-001-094-016-003-356,557
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head Q (Ministry of Communications and Information),013-001-094-016-003,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Next, I noticed that when it comes to Government public communications, the translation for materials and publicity for the Malay and Tamil languages always come later. So, I would assume that in doing translation, there would be separate teams and probably have different capacities. So, do we have a capacity issue that some of these translations for the Malay and Tamil language materials come much later and whether the Government has sufficient talent and resources to upkeep the standards of Malay and Tamil translations for Government materials?",2,357,013-001-094-016-003-357,558

The first question on PSB, as I mentioned in my speech and also in my response to Mr Ganesh Rajaram, PSB is used to support our media industry, both Mediacorp as well as other local media companies. And we want to do this because in the end it is about being able to produce good quality Singapore content, and to be able to tell the Singapore story and to engage our audiences. This can be done by Mediacorp but it can also be done by other players, whether it is directly through the contestable funding or through Mediacorp.",1,358,013-001-094-016-003-358,559

Mediacorp plays a very critical role as our national broadcaster. While we do want to support the independent producers and we want to grow many of these local media companies, create good jobs for Singaporeans, I think it is also important that while we do that, we must provide the necessary support and resources to help Mediacorp to succeed because, as a national broadcaster, there are certain important roles that they play to shape the Singapore identity, spread Singapore values, heritage and culture.

It is an area which we are trying to build up. We do need more resources and capabilities in all three languages − Chinese, Malay and Tamil. And, in fact, our friends from the media will sometimes tell us that when we send out information, it is very often done in English and for the Chinese papers, the Malay papers, the Tamil papers, they have to spend quite a lot of time to do the translation. Within the Government, this is an area which we are trying to build up and we do want to, whether it is through scholarships or through other schemes, reach out to more young Singaporeans and get them to have an interest in translation.",3,360,013-001-094-016-003-360,561

Indeed, it is an important part of how a start-up has to deal with the brutal realities of both the technological space as well as our small market.

The young people themselves need to have some opportunity to expose themselves to what happens outside of our own market. That means that the companies that are operating either in the region or internationally need to be located here to provide these opportunities. So, there are multiple things that we need to do but it comes down to connecting the businesses here with opportunities in the region, connecting the people here with businesses that operate outside of Singapore and educating them as they develop their business, as they develop their start-ups think about the internationalisation strategy very, very early on in the process. There are a number of things that we need to do at MCI and its partners are very much focused on this. I thank the Member for the question.",2,365,013-001-094-016-003-365,566

Indeed, housing has always been a hot-button issue, and as I was preparing for this COS, which is my first COS for MND, I went back to the Hansard to look at the records of previous years' debates. So, I did some extra homework. And indeed, from the start of our housing programme, going back to 1960s, there has been lively debate on the MND Budget and on housing issues. It is no different this year, if you look at the number of cuts we received.",2,132,013-001-094-016-004-132,722

As Mr Alex Yam said, it ultimately is about building communities, and it is our people who shape our sense of community and our sense of home. That is why over the past years, we have stepped up our engagement with Singaporeans to ""inform early, consult early, discuss widely"", as suggested by Mr Yam. We did this with our ""Our Singapore Conversation"" in 2013, continued with engagements on public housing over the past two years. We started our SGFuture dialogues this year to shape our next phase of development.",6,136,013-001-094-016-004-136,726

First, we will strengthen our home ownership programme to meet the needs of Singaporeans, especially the more vulnerable groups. Second, we will transform our urban landscape to invest in new infrastructure for our future economy and to build a future city that we can be proud of. Third, we will create a quality living environment for all to enjoy and make Singapore a more car-lite and people-friendly city.",7,137,013-001-094-016-004-137,727
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),Let me elaborate on each of these in turn.,8,138,013-001-094-016-004-138,728
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Firstly, in terms of strengthening our home ownership programme. This has always been the hallmark of our public housing system and we must and will continue to strengthen this key pillar of our social compact. Our focus is to help young couples own their first flat. Our pledge to young Singaporean couples is that we will always keep new BTO prices stable and affordable for them. That is why we enhanced our housing grants last year, and since then, many more homebuyers have benefited. One such couple is Mr See Cheng Long and his fiancÃ©e Miss Felicia Poh. They booked a 3-room flat in Bukit Batok in the BTO exercise last November. They were eligible for $60,000 in housing grants. And so they were able to buy the flat for less than $140,000.",9,139,013-001-094-016-004-139,729
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),This meant that the mortgage loan was completely paid for or will be completely paid for using their CPF. There is no need for any cash outlay and so they end up having more savings. I hope this gives them confidence to plan for the next step – to get married and hopefully to start a family soon.,10,140,013-001-094-016-004-140,730
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Our housing subsidies are rightly focused on the lower and middle-income households, but we have not neglected those in the higher income groups as well.

2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Mr Gan Thiam Poh suggested that we do away with the income ceiling altogether. I appreciate his intent to allow all Singaporeans to buy a HDB flat and that is something we would like to do as well. We want to move in this direction and that is why the income ceiling has been progressively moved up over time. But we have to calibrate these moves. Firstly, there are fiscal constraints to manage and secondly, having just made a move last year, we will need time for the increased new demand to flow through the system without adversely affecting the interest of the rest who are already in the queue.",12,142,013-001-094-016-004-142,732
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"At the same time, I want to assure Mr Gan that we will continue to take steps to ensure that Executive Condominiums (ECs) remain affordable. We already do so through various measures and that is why ECs today, are more affordable than comparable private properties. Indeed, if you look back over the past few quarters, EC prices have remained relatively stable. We will continue to monitor and take necessary action if needed.",13,143,013-001-094-016-004-143,733
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Besides housing grants, we have also shortened the queues considerably for first-timers. One measure of this is the application rate of first-timer families for new BTO flats in non-mature estates. It is an indicator which we monitor very carefully. This has remained stable at about 1.6 last year.",14,144,013-001-094-016-004-144,734
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"In practical terms, in practice, it means that most will be able to select their new BTO flat within their first or second application, and definitely on their third try. I understand Members have shared concerns about newlywed couples who have repeatedly applied for an HDB flat without success. I have heard similar experiences during my Meet-the-People sessions. In fact, one couple told me at MPS that they had applied more than five times! So, I asked for their details. I went back to HDB and asked for a check. I found out that they were, in fact, interested in flats near the city centre and so all their applications were for flats in mature estates around the city centre; for example, in Ang Mo Kio and Toa Payoh.",15,145,013-001-094-016-004-145,735

2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"I would encourage first-timer couples to consider applying for flats in non-mature estates. As I have mentioned earlier, if you look at the application rate, there is a very high chance of them getting it within their first and second try, and definitely within their third try. And the flats there, in these estates are also more affordable. While waiting for the flats to be completed, they can consider renting a flat under the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS).",17,147,013-001-094-016-004-147,737
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"I recognise that some want a flat more urgently, or would prefer specific locations for good and practical reasons, for example, to live near their parents. In the current market, they can consider buying a resale flat. Resale prices have moderated and they are more affordable now. For example, you can compare HDB resale prices against household income.",18,148,013-001-094-016-004-148,738
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"At one time, prices were rising faster than income. But this is no longer the case. Between the last property market trough in 2009 and 2015, HDB resale prices increased by 35% but median household income increased by a higher 44%. So, housing affordability has improved and there are many attractive options available in the resale market.",19,149,013-001-094-016-004-149,739
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"In addition, we introduced the Proximity Housing Grant (PHG) which helps families who wish to live near or with their parents or married child to buy a resale flat. This means that a young couple can enjoy up to $90,000 in housing grants to buy their first home from the resale market – $30,000 in the CPF Housing Grant, up to $40,000 in Additional CPF Housing Grant, and $20,000 in the Proximity Housing Grant.",20,150,013-001-094-016-004-150,740
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),Miss Cheryl Chan asked if we can do more to help young married couples to get their flats early and live nearer to parents. I share her desire to do so and we will continue to study ways to help them further.,21,151,013-001-094-016-004-151,741
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We have also managed to reduce the queue for second-timer families and they too can benefit from the Proximity Grant. Here, I would like to share the experience of one couple, Mdm Nur Liza binte Roslan and Mr Yulandi bin Abu Bakar. They bought their first flat which was a 4-room flat at Taman Jurong from HDB. As their family grew, Mdm Nur Liza wanted to move out and move closer to her parents who are living in Bukit Batok, so that they can help look after the children. They looked at several housing options and eventually, they managed to find a 4-room resale flat in Bukit Batok on the same floor, just down the corridor from her parents' place. And so, with the Proximity Grant, they were able to buy the resale flat for about $324,000. This is in fact comparable to what they would have had to pay for a new 4-room flat from HDB as second-timers. In fact, they are better off by going to the resale market. The amount they pay is about the same as BTO after grant. They get a flat closer to parents and they get to move in earlier as well.",22,152,013-001-094-016-004-152,742
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"So for both first-timers and second-timers, the softening of the property market and the introduction of the new Proximity Grant and enhancements of all the various grant that we have had, means that there are many more attractive options to consider for purchasing a home.",23,153,013-001-094-016-004-153,743
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Likewise, there are also more housing options for singles. In 2013, we made a significant policy shift to allow first-timer singles to buy a new 2-room flat from HDB. Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked about this and I would like to assure her that we have launched more 2-room flats to meet this new demand from singles. We also increased the quota for singles from 30% to 50% last year. As a result, the BTO application rate among singles has been steadily improving. It started out very high, over 30 when we made the move in 2013. It came down to 8.5 last year, and it was 7.7 in the most recent BTO exercise.",24,154,013-001-094-016-004-154,744
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"I intend to bring down this application rate further. It will take time, but we will make it happen. The move to open new flats to singles is a significant one and has met with a strong demand surge. We will need some time to clear the bulk of this demand, but we will bring down the application rate.",25,155,013-001-094-016-004-155,745
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"In considering their home options, home buyers will have to do their homework, and they should evaluate carefully the different factors before making the purchase. Mr Chong Kee Hiong mentioned one concern about the lease of existing flats. He is right that like all leasehold properties, the value of an HDB flat will decline as leases run down. Flat buyers and home buyers have to take this into account in their financial planning. But for now, a large majority of flats have more than 60 years of lease remaining. They continue to be highly liveable, and the neighbourhoods will benefit from upgrading from time to time. There is still value in our resale flats. We will continue to find ways to help our elderly Singaporeans monetise the value of their flats in an orderly fashion and we will also publicise the schemes for doing so, as Members like Mr Alex Yam, Mr Faisal Manap and Mr Chen Show Mao have highlighted. The Minister of State Koh Poh Koon will elaborate on this later in his speech.",26,156,013-001-094-016-004-156,746
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"At the same time, whether buying a new BTO flat or a resale flat, there is a need to be financially prudent. We have homes for every budget – 3-room flat can vary from $180,000 for a BTO in Bukit Batok to $368,000 for a resale flat in Queenstown. My message to home buyers is this  we will do whatever we can to support you in your home ownership goals. But please choose a home that meets your needs and is within your means. I understand the desire to buy a large flat or one with a central location, but this should not come at the expense of a huge debt burden overwhelming the entire family.",27,157,013-001-094-016-004-157,747
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Having cleared the backlog for first-timers and made progress for singles and second-timers, we are now getting more requests for new flats to accommodate other buyer groups. For example, Mr Gan Thiam Poh suggested giving Singaporeans the chance to buy a third BTO flat. Now, I understand why people would like to buy a new flat from HDB. That is why we are allowing them to do so twice. We also have short-lease 2-room Flexi flats for seniors to buy a third flat from HDB. But I do not think we can go beyond that.",28,158,013-001-094-016-004-158,748

And we have to be realistic. Our land is limited; our financial resources are finite. We must therefore prioritise among various home buyers. It is easy to give in to the demands and accommodate all the immediate requests and build as much as we can today and not think about tomorrow. But this would not be a responsible thing to do. We must consider the impact of our actions today on the next generation. We must always be mindful of the implications of over-building and consider how a glut of flats will have a negative impact on the value of homes for all Singaporeans",29,159,013-001-094-016-004-159,749
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"So we need to strike that balance and that balance includes looking at resale and new flats. This year, we are building 18,000 new flats. This is more than the previous year, and we have done so to accommodate the increased demand from recent policy changes. But we cannot continue at this rate perpetually. We intend to gradually taper down our building programme to achieve a more sustainable level over the medium term.",30,160,013-001-094-016-004-160,750

But it is too early to declare victory and unwind the measures. Any relaxation of the measures now may risk a premature market rebound and I am sure that is an outcome we all want to avoid. Nevertheless, we recognise that the property market is affected by the broader economy and global events. We are also very mindful that the property market in turn can have broader impact on other sectors of the economy.

2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Besides providing rental flats, we want to do more to help second-timers in public rental buy a home. For many of them, second-timer families in the rental flats, they are no longer eligible for housing grants; they are probably unable to get a bank loan and so they will face greater difficulties in moving out of their rental situation to have a home of their own. That is why we are introducing the Fresh Start Housing Scheme, and it is aimed at parents with school-going children, so that their children can grow up in a stable home environment.",35,165,013-001-094-016-004-165,755
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Let me share the key features of the scheme. First, the families who qualify will be able to buy a new 2-room flexi flat. The flat will come with shorter leases, ranging from 45 to 65 years, to keep the price affordable. It will also come with a longer Minimum Occupation Period (MOP), I think Mr Gan also suggested this just now. The longer MOP will be 20 years to ensure a stable home for the children.",36,166,013-001-094-016-004-166,756

To qualify for the scheme and receive the full grant, families will have to show commitment to remain in stable employment, manage their finances well, and ensure their children are attending school regularly. These are conditions that we have worked out through our consultations and they were also highlighted by several Members, including Mr Alex Yam earlier. In line with the efforts they make, the grant will correspondingly be disbursed in tranches over time  $20,000 will be given out when they collect their keys and the remainder will be disbursed annually over the next five years.",39,169,013-001-094-016-004-169,759

I am very mindful that these conditions should not be onerous. But at the same time, we are making a major move for these families by giving them another grant so I think it is fair that they must be able to show a certain level of commitment towards homeownership.

If along the way, some families encounter difficulties, the social agencies will be there to help them. We will consider their individual circumstances and the effort that they are making to meet the conditions. In doing so, we will not rely on just a single matrix or single criterion because we will exercise judgement and discretion and will look at it case by case.

With Fresh Start, they will be able to buy a new 2-room flat with a 60-year lease. They will have a monthly instalment of about $300. It is slightly more than their monthly rental. But the key is this  they can now pay for this largely through their CPF. If you look at the illustration, the bulk of it will now be paid through CPF and their cash outlay is $10 a month. Ultimately, this will be their flat. It is not a rental flat. They will own this place. It is a comparable amount that they have to pay overall, but a large part of it is paid through CPF now, they would be able to own their own flat eventually.",1,174,013-001-094-016-004-174,764

In some ways, it will be a more difficult journey because we are starting from a higher base with more biting resource constraints. The competition is also becoming more intense. We are in a new era of city competition. There are more than 400 cities in the world each with at least a million people. Among them are many emerging world cities, all vying for talent and investments. There is intense competition. We are starting from a higher base, but we cannot afford to stand still. We should take comfort that we are moving from a position of strength. Despite our limitation of size, we are far from saturation.

If you actually travel through one of these routes or take a cycling ride through one of these routes, you will realise that they are not fully seamless, and there are some gaps along the way.

[A slide was shown to hon Members] This is across Serangoon Road, a potential bridge that you can cycle through Serangoon Road. So, if we are able to smoothen out these different kinks in the route, say, with potential links like this, then residents staying in Bishan, Bidadari, Toa Payoh would have a more direct and seamless travelling experience, whether it is through walking, cycling or any other personal mobility device, from their HDB towns to the city centre.

2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"   Thank you, Sir. The Aljunied-Hougang Town Council currently manages 1,760 lifts in HDB estates, out of which 470 are new lifts installed under the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) being turned on from 2012 onwards. Based on the figures gathered for lift breakdown in FY15/16, there were 3,683 breakdowns in total or 7.84 breakdowns per lift on average.",1,308,013-001-094-016-004-308,898
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),This is a relatively high breakdown rate considering these new lifts are barely three years old. I am not sure whether this happens only in Aljunied-Hougang Town or across the board. I would like to urge MND to take a look at the quality of the LUP lifts.,2,309,013-001-094-016-004-309,899
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied),"Next, with the growth in the numbers of lifts contributed by the LUP, the expenditure on lift maintenance for each year is also rising. In the case of Aljunied-Hougang TC, the latest revision in maintenance contracts by the original lift manufacturers will result in a cost increase of between 4.08% and 8.52%. The projected upward revision in maintenance rates beyond 2017 is even higher, estimated to be between 8.66% and 10.72%.",3,310,013-001-094-016-004-310,900

Since 1997, we have heard about the idea of pneumatic conveyance systems for waste disposal in our HDB estates, brought up in this House by the then Minister for Environment, Mr Yeo Cheow Tong. In 2013, I filed a cut noting that a pilot project under the Greenprint Initiative was slated to be carried out in Jurong East in 2013 and 2014.",7,314,013-001-094-016-004-314,904

Such a system can afford all Town Councils not only in better productivity but also savings in manpower costs. It is environmentally sustainable and gets rid of the problem of foul smells during refuse collection.",8,315,013-001-094-016-004-315,905

2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap,"Many residents I have spoken to welcome this form of assistance rendered by HDB and it lessens their financial burden. However, concerns persist and I would like to reflect my residents' sentiments in this House. For instance, if the ceiling at the lower floor unit faces a leak or has signs of leakage such as distinct watermark or a blotted patch, no repair works would be done to the damaged ceiling. Only the source of the leak located at the upper floor would be rectified but upon the completion of the repair works, both flat owners, the upper floor as well as the lower floor, will each be billed 25% of the total repair cost. This is not fair to the lower floor home owners.",2,319,013-001-094-016-004-319,909

In fact, a resident who is staying in the lower floor unit said to me that in order to make repairs to her unit, she had to fork out additional costs. She is of the view that the repair of this damaged ceilings and its consequent repair costs should be included in the GRA scheme as the damage of their unit's ceiling should be the joint responsibility of both owners in accordance to the spirit of this particular policy.",3,320,013-001-094-016-004-320,910

2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"The exact source of the hot spring remains unknown. Hot springs are formed when under groundwater enters the earth's crust as deep as 3 kilometres underground, and get heated up to high temperatures by the hot rock masses. The high pressure causes the hot boiling water to seep upwards through cracks, thereby forcing itself out of ground into a spring. At this point, the temperature of the water drops to about 70 degrees.",2,323,013-001-094-016-004-323,913
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang),"There is an interesting history to our hot spring. In 1909, Seah Eng Keong, the son of pioneer Seah Liang Seah, had discovered hot springs in his pineapple estate and channelled the springs altogether so they could be concentrated in one area. A well was built along the spring and became popular with the villagers. The village was then known as Kampong Ayer Panas, means ""Village of Hot Water"".",3,324,013-001-094-016-004-324,914

2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Firstly, the current ROS requires 100% support from the neighbourhood shops for the upgrading to proceed, not a single less. Although we have Merchant Associations to bring the heartland shops together, not all act in unison. Very often, there will be one or two shops that are less cooperative, especially for shop owners who lease the shops to other tenants. They are basically investors who are more concerned about rental income than neighbourhood upgrading. As a result, the upgrading programme cannot proceed because of them. Thus, I hope the Minister can take into consideration the interest of the majority of the shop owners and patrons, and adopt the model for Home Improvement Programme on the use of polling. Perhaps we can consider amending the law, so that merchant associations only need to obtain support from 75% of shop owners for the upgrading to proceed.",4,345,013-001-094-016-004-345,935

On the Lift Upgrading Programme, Mr Png Eng Huat had mentioned some concerns at Block 314. I presume it is in his area. Please raise it to HDB or to MND so that we can have a better look at it. Mr Low Thia Khiang spoke about lift maintenance, lift parts and about lift breakdowns. On the point on lift breakdowns, there is a tele-monitoring system in every lift in HDB, which provides data remotely to the Town Council, so you can establish what the cause of the fault is. So, I would urge the hon Member to take a look at the Town Council data and have a sense as to what the causes of these frequent breakdowns are. Some of it could be the nature of the use of the lift, some of it could be the frequency of Town Council's maintenance regime or the capability and the competence of the engineers they engage, amongst other reasons. So, I think it is good to drill down and analyse what your problems are.",61,413,013-001-094-016-004-413,1003

But let me emphasise that LBS is not the only option to monetise a flat. Elderly households staying in larger flats, for example 5-room flats, actually have a few options to monetise their flat. Firstly, they can choose to rent out a room, especially if their children have moved out and they have a spare room. Two, they can also move to a smaller flat, if they are a couple with no children staying with them. By doing so, and staying in a short-lease 2-room Flexi flat, they can also benefit from the Silver Housing Bonus which is a cash bonus. Thirdly, for those who have moved in with their children to enjoy mutual support, they can also consider renting out the whole flat.

On the issue of lift breakdowns, he talks about the quality of the LUP. In deciding what lifts are put into a housing estate, including in LUP, we process projects by way of a price quality procurement process where you look not just at price, but also the quality of the lift. So, there are certain specifications that have to be met. As I said earlier, I think we need to really have a proper drill down by the Town Council. If you think there is an issue, raise it to MND and HDB, so that you can assess whether it is an issue of the lift brand, lift model, or is it a specific issue with regards to a particular shaft? Is it a maintenance problem? Is it a usage issue? So, I think beyond speculation, it is better to look at specifics.",1,499,013-001-094-016-004-499,1089

2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,Mr Desmond Lee,"In this particular instance, it will be the residents of the lower floor who are suffering from the leakage, and therefore the scheme encourages both parties to do what is necessary to solve the problem. So the Government, HDB will pay half the cost of fixing the leakage. Most of the work, as the Member rightly points out, involves waterproofing membrane works for the upper floor unit. For the lower floor unit, you may need to fix some spalling of concrete, because of the leakage problem. And so the GRA also addresses that. I think, for your particular case, let us have a closer look and we will see what aspect of the ceiling has been damaged, and whether it is related to the leakage.",2,511,013-001-094-016-004-511,1101
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,"   Thank you, Chairman. I have three clarifications. First, on the singles scheme. I would like to know based on HDB's records, how many singles are still applying for the flat and have not got it successfully? The Minister mentioned that it will be cleared soon. I would like to know how soon?",1,512,013-001-094-016-004-512,1102
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,The second question is on the Fresh Start Grant. Minister mentioned that they should have school-going age children. May I ask does it include children who are in tertiary education? Does it include private tertiary education?,2,513,013-001-094-016-004-513,1103

2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,Mr Lawrence Wong,"   Madam, on the first point about singles. We would not be able to exactly pin point what is the demand for singles, because there may be more coming forward to apply. We do not have the exact number in terms of forecasting demand from singles, but I would say that it is still quite strong. We still see quite a lot of applications even in the last BTO exercise. If you look at the application rate, as I mentioned, it is more than seven, which indicates that there is still very strong demand.",1,515,013-001-094-016-004-515,1105
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Based on that level, I think we will take two to three years to clear that level of demand. Will even more come forward once the queue gets shorter? Maybe. That is why I said even after we have cleared this current surge of demand, there may be more coming forward, but that is the kind of numbers and timeframe we are looking at.",2,516,013-001-094-016-004-516,1106
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The second question is on the Fresh Start Grant and the condition for the school-going children. We are looking at a parent with at least one child in school, particularly because we want to make sure that the child has a stable environment to grow up in. At least one child, so that means school-going age, which is anything that is less than 16 years old. But if they have more than one child, they can be in university, they can be in tertiary institutions, private institutions, and that is fine.",3,517,013-001-094-016-004-517,1107

2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,Mr Desmond Lee,"Yes, certainly that is key. I spoke earlier in my speech about how BCA is going upstream and having a whole suite of scholarships to encourage Singapore students in our institutions, whether it is in ITE, Polytechnics and Universities, to come on-board the built environment sector. There is also an Earn-and-Learn scheme, where after they join the particular programme at an institution, they learn and earn along the way, and get brought in to the sector.",2,519,013-001-094-016-004-519,1109

In fact, whilst the push to productivity is one of the key drivers behind adopting higher technology or game-changing technology in construction, such as VDC and DfMA. Ultimately, if you look at it by using technology, using ICT, building in a smart and creative way, this also creates niches and opportunities for Singaporeans to come into the built environment sector as well.",3,520,013-001-094-016-004-520,1110

That has been the norm. Now, we have some GLS which specify that the construction must be by PPVC, and it is not 100%. I think it is about 60% by PPVC; the rest can be by casting in situ, so we provide some flexibility. It is transparent and it is a level-playing field. Parties who bid for these land sale sites know that there is a certain technological requirement.

2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,Mr Desmond Lee,"As for one of the points, I think, the Member raised in his speech earlier about whether we can relax the requirement for contractors or developers to finish the project within x number of years, I think we do not want the land to be hoarded. There are certain requirements that drive us to have GLS, especially for residential and commercial uses. They are meant to meet the demand that we have projected and we do not want, and certainly, no Singaporean would want land to be hoarded indefinitely. We want to see that the project is developed.

First of all, on the issue of land and farming, we obviously want to encourage our farmers to be more productive. It is something that we want to encourage them to do, and the Agricultural Productivity Fund is one of those measures. We will continue to engage our farmers actively to encourage them to do so.",1,527,013-001-094-016-004-527,1117
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"In terms of the question earlier about how we can increase the tenure to encourage them to be more productive, we are still in the midst of consulting our farmers. The indication is that they would prefer to have a longer tenure, in order to allow them to invest sufficiently. We will take their feedback into consideration in deciding how we want to award our tenures and scope the policy accordingly.",2,528,013-001-094-016-004-528,1118
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"As for the question about whether the current schemes and measures are sufficient to help families in the economic downturn, there are quite a number of schemes and policies that can help families, whether they are first-timers, second-timers, whether they are divorced. At the end of the day, HDB does take a flexible approach to help families who are in need, even if they do fall within these schemes.

2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,Mr Leon Perera,"   Yes. So, my question is  would the Minister of State consider doing this survey on a regular basis? Because my understanding is that the market has softened and the markets do go through cycles, so would such a survey about whether flat owners have difficulties finding tenants, be something that the Ministry would do on a regular basis?",1,537,013-001-094-016-004-537,1127
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,Mr Leon Perera,"The second point of clarification is regarding the Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS). The hon Minister of State mentioned rental and downgrading as other options, but of course, rental depends on the market; downgrading has other downsides, like commissions and costs. There is evidence to suggest that the bequeath motives hold back some people from exercising LBS. Would the Ministry look into ways to address the bequeath motive issue that is holding back some people from making use of the LBS, such as the suggestion made by Mr Chen Show Mao?",2,538,013-001-094-016-004-538,1128
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,Mr Leon Perera,"Lastly, on the Agricultural Productivity Fund (APF), I would like to ask the Ministry why the disbursement of the fund has been quite low so far. Clearly, there are deserving projects, in terms of indoor and vertical farming. Is it because of a lack of deserving projects? Or is it because of some lack of connectivity between the companies, the farmers, and the agency in charge of disbursing the fund?",3,539,013-001-094-016-004-539,1129

One of the ways we can sense whether this is going to become an important issue is through our MPS. We can sense whether this is a common enough problem.",1,540,013-001-094-016-004-540,1130

But with or without a survey, estate agents are available, websites that allow matching of rental tenants and people with rooms to rent are also available. So, we do not quite need a survey for any of these services to be available.

I think at the end of the day, it is an option and a choice that the elderly couple has to decide, how they want to monetise their flat. If they do want to bequeath their flat, then I think it makes more sense for them to retain the whole flat, rent it out in the meantime – either whole flat or a room – while keeping the full intact value of the flat to bequeath it to their children.",3,542,013-001-094-016-004-542,1132
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"If you have the LBS where you already sold part of the lease back to HDB and you only have such a short lease left, I am not sure how much value there is for the couple to bequeath to their children. If the intent is to bequeath the flat to their children, they should keep the flat. But if what they want is to monetise their flat, there are many options. We are not trying to push people to go onto the LBS, so there is no real need to try to make it so attractive for people to go onto the LBS. At this moment, by expanding the LBS to allow 4-room flat owners to join, we have already catered to almost 75% of the elderly who own flats. That is adequate for the moment.",4,543,013-001-094-016-004-543,1133
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head T (Ministry of National Development),013-001-094-016-004,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Regarding the APF and why the take-up rate may not be as high as we would want it to be, I think part of the reason could be that farmers make their choices about how they want to transform. We have to do it from two ways. One, encourage them to continue to look forward, to be more forward-looking and to adopt technology, so the persuasion part has to be there. Secondly, perhaps some farmers may find that the existing farms may be nearing the end of their lease, so they might be hesitant to take the lead and so do. Certainly, as they renew their lease, we can encourage them to look at how they can use the APF to further change the way they do farming, so that as they take on a new lease with a longer life span, they can then utilise the APF effectively to up their farming technologies.",5,544,013-001-094-016-004-544,1134

We plan, execute and implement projects and plans exceedingly well. But let us pause and consider if we do it in an effective way.",12,12,013-001-094-016-005-012,1152
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport),013-001-094-016-005,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"I raise three points for discussion. First, are Singaporeans adequately prepared to accept this changing transportation model? The ownership of cars is a norm in many countries. In Singapore, this is clearly unsustainable. Our population has grown significantly over the years and we expect it to grow more. Similarly, the number of vehicles has also grown. But the land we live on cannot. We have tried with land reclamation but we are clearly limited by what we can do.",13,13,013-001-094-016-005-013,1153

2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport),013-001-094-016-005,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"Second, we are an ageing population. This is an issue close to my heart.

2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport),013-001-094-016-005,Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir),"I explain with an example. There is a new housing development now being built in Potong Pasir. The land it is on is directly next to Potong Pasir MRT station. During construction, the developer blocked off the most direct walking route that my residents take to the MRT station. The developer was required to build sheltered walkways along the perimeter of the land to facilitate our residents' needs. I remained deeply concerned. Yes, sheltered walkways are good but it is now a more circuitous route. A five-minute walk has become 15 minutes. For a young adult or even a not so young adult like me, we can manage. But for an elderly person, this extra 10 minutes of walking can be a torturous and excruciating exercise. I raise the example to show that a truly efficient and effective transportation model must be convenient and accessible to all Singaporeans and not just the able-bodied majority.",17,17,013-001-094-016-005-017,1157

Reliability of our public transport system, especially of our MRT system, has been an issue raised on many occasions. Improvements have clearly been done. But with the rapid expansion of the MRT lines or of a new line or extension every year for the next five years, is this a case of biting off more than we can chew?

Will the overcrowding at the platform be resolved? Will it shield my residents from hot morning sun? Will it cover my residents' bicycles from rain and shine? Will it be more elderly friendly with the provision of more seats, brighter and bigger signages? Will there be beautiful artwork display perhaps to cool them down when they cannot squeeze into the overcrowded train and have to wait for the next train?

2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport),013-001-094-016-005,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Early detection and intervention can certainly help our bus captains identify and address potential health threats before they fall seriously ill. Through a recent health screening project piloted by the union involving close to 900 bus captains, we found that eight out of 10 had unhealthy BMI, blood pressure or cholesterol. I would like to urge the Ministry and the public transport operators to look into providing free annual health screenings for all bus captains and to include it as a condition inside the bus contracting model.",11,64,013-001-094-016-005-064,1204
2016-04-11,Committee of Supply – Head W (Ministry of Transport),013-001-094-016-005,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"Next, we need to stop the abuse of bus captains. During my ground visits, I hear bus captains having bad encounters with commuters. They are often at the receiving end of verbal abuse by some commuters. Sometimes, the abuse could also be physical. Our bus captains are striving to serve the commuters well every day. They deserve some respect for their hard work and not abuse. I would like to ask for the support of the Ministry and the public transport tripartite partners to do more to stop the abuse of our bus captains.",12,65,013-001-094-016-005-065,1205

Our bus captains deserve greater recognition than what they receive today. I hope that the Ministry can consider designating a ""Bus Captains' Day"" every year to recognise their dedicated contributions and service to our community.",13,66,013-001-094-016-005-066,1206
