2023-02-14,Effect of Prices of Goods on Major E-commerce Platforms on Consumer Price Index,014-001-095-083-002,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the prices of goods on all major e-commerce platforms are taken into consideration when computing the Consumer Price Index; and (b) whether the wide diversity and competitive pricing on the e-commerce platforms have helped lower the cost of living for local residents in addition to having a stronger Singapore dollar.,1,1,014-001-095-083-002-001,7

E-commerce benefits consumers by offering them a wider choice of goods and services, at a wider range of prices. It also reduces the costs of sale such as those incurred by physical retail outlets.",1,2,014-001-095-083-002-002,8

Without such certainty, funds of a single family office may be taxed in Singapore in addition to the tax that the family, as an investor, may be subject to. This would make it unattractive for single family offices to set up and invest in funds in Singapore.",1,2,014-001-095-083-003-002,10

Hence the more meaningful way to create local jobs is through their positive spillover effects in creating demand for ancillary services like legal, custody and tax services and fund administration. As elaborated in this House previously, Government agencies are developing initiatives to tap the growing interest from family offices to provide capital to support enterprise financing, ESG investments and philanthropic activities.",4,5,014-001-095-083-003-005,13

2023-02-14,Tax Benefits Enjoyed by Family Offices in Singapore and Spin-offs for the Economy,014-001-095-083-003,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"  I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I have two supplementary questions. First, does MAS have the regulatory powers to oversee family offices to prevent tax evasion and fraud? Second, will the Government consider having the employment of Singaporeans as a hiring requirement for family offices for local job creation?",1,9,014-001-095-083-003-009,17
2023-02-14,Tax Benefits Enjoyed by Family Offices in Singapore and Spin-offs for the Economy,014-001-095-083-003,Mr Alvin Tan,"  I thank the Member for his supplementary question. Family offices do open accounts with banks in Singapore and MAS requires all banks operating in Singapore to put in place robust controls to detect and defer the flow of illicit funds. These controls include rigorous processes to identify customers, understand the intended purpose of account opening, evaluate the risks posed and monitor the accounts on an ongoing basis for suspicious activity. Since 2018, Singapore has activated over 70 relationships with countries to share tax-related information. Though these relationships, tax authorities will be able to get information through financial institutions of account holders who are their tax residents. These reaffirm Singapore's commitment to international standards on transparency and cross-border tax cooperation to deter tax evasion.",1,10,014-001-095-083-003-010,18
2023-02-14,Tax Benefits Enjoyed by Family Offices in Singapore and Spin-offs for the Economy,014-001-095-083-003,Mr Alvin Tan,"On the Member's other question, I would like to respond that single family offices are set up to manage the family's own monies. And thus, it is reasonable for the families to have the discretion to make their own decisions on who to hire to manage their families' investments. Further, family offices often invest in globally diversified assets which may require knowledge of overseas markets; and fundamentally, not imposing a requirement to hire locals is to allow family offices the same ability to make hiring decisions that are based on merit, similar to other employers.",2,11,014-001-095-083-003-011,19
2023-02-14,Tax Benefits Enjoyed by Family Offices in Singapore and Spin-offs for the Economy,014-001-095-083-003,Mr Alvin Tan,"Nonetheless, it is our objective to create good jobs here and to give our locals the best chance to take up those jobs by investing heavily in their capabilities and skills. To equip locals with skills relevant to family offices, MAS has partnered with industry experts and the Institute of Banking and Finance to launch three skills maps for the family office sector in 2020 and 2021.",3,12,014-001-095-083-003-012,20

These skills maps are used by training providers such as our Wealth Management Institute and the Singapore Management University (SMU) Business Families Institute to develop relevant training programmes, with co-funding of training fees provided for Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents.

The Indian government intends to implement a similar requirement. But most countries have not announced similar measures. We are monitoring developments in this space, including manufacturers' response to the EU requirements. In the meantime, we have implemented other ways to manage e-waste, such as the Extended Producer Responsibility framework.",1,2,014-001-095-083-004-002,23

I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I would just like to ask one supplementary question. What would be the triggers or key factors in determining a change in policy on this, given the developments in the EU and India that the Minister of State referred to? Reports state that the measure, when it comes into effect in the EU, will cut down e-waste by 11,000 tonnes a year and save consumers 250 million euros a year. So, in light of that, what would be the factors that would be the triggers that will bring about a change in policy on this point?",1,4,014-001-095-083-004-004,25

Each PWM ladder differentiates job rungs based on the job scope and skills required. Higher wages on upper job rungs reflect the increased responsibilities and skills expected of employees.

An employer must therefore pay an employee the applicable PWM wage even if the employee has not yet met the PWM training requirements, as long as the employee is performing the job.",3,4,014-001-095-083-005-004,31

Tripartite partners are mindful that training requirements meant to uplift lower-wage workers should not end up disadvantaging them. To support the training of workers who may have lower literacy skills or face language barriers, training providers can supplement the delivery of PWM training courses with vernacular and/or visual aids. Where feasible, some PWM training requirements can also be met through assessment-only pathways. These pathways allow experienced employees to meet the PWM training requirements by completing assessments – and typically, these are done in person – to show that they have the requisite skills, without having to attend the course.",5,6,014-001-095-083-005-006,33

Employees who face challenges in completing PWM training requirements due to language or literacy limitations may approach SSG for further assistance. Employees who feel unfairly treated can approach their unions or MOM for assistance.",6,7,014-001-095-083-005-007,34

We recognise positive traits such as resilience and sense of duty among this group of caregivers. However, we are mindful not to over-generalise caregivers as they are unique individuals after all, and employers ought to assess each of them fairly based on their qualities and ability to fulfil the job requirements without bias.",1,2,014-001-095-083-006-002,36

And so, the company is now diversifying and applying its capabilities in the offshore renewable energy market.

KidSTART's preliminary outcomes are encouraging. There are some early indications that KidSTART children had better preschool attendance than their peers of similar socio-economic backgrounds.

Over the last decade, our spending on the early childhood sector has grown to six times its original size, from $320 million in FY2013 to about $1.9 billion in FY2022. Lower-income families now pay as little as $3 a month for full-day childcare in an Anchor Operator preschool.",188,189,014-001-095-083-022-189,382

At the same time, over the next two years, we will work with Anchor Operators to create 22,000 more full-day childcare places and expand the number of MOE Kindergartens.
