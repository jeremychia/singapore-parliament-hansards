2018-03-20,Counselling for Family Members of Patients in Palliative Care,013-001-094-070-001,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for Health),"  Palliative care providers have multidisciplinary care teams that support patients on palliative care services and their family members. These teams comprise staff with experience in counselling, such as medical social workers, counsellors, or pastoral care staff.",1,2,013-001-094-070-001-002,2
2018-03-20,Counselling for Family Members of Patients in Palliative Care,013-001-094-070-001,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for Health),"The care teams will keep in close touch with family members, assess their needs and provide the necessary support for the patient and the family. This includes support to help family members cope with care-giving and grief management, as well as bereavement care after the patient’s passing. Care teams may also link up families with other support organisations and resources.",2,3,013-001-094-070-001-003,3

For example, in conjunction with World Hospice and Palliative Care Day, Singapore Hospice Council held an inaugural community engagement event in October last year, to raise public awareness on the topic. We will continue to work with our community partners on such public outreach and education efforts.",3,4,013-001-094-070-001-004,4

2018-03-20,Counselling for Family Members of Patients in Palliative Care,013-001-094-070-001,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"  I thank the Member for her supplementary questions. Indeed, I think this is a very important issue, in particular, due to our ageing population. The uptake of counselling services is not specifically tracked because it is delivered as part of palliative care. Upon admission into palliative care services, the patients and the family members will be made aware of the counselling services available as part of the holistic assessment in recognition of the patients' and the families' needs. This would include their physical, psycho-social as well as their pastoral needs.",1,6,013-001-094-070-001-006,6
2018-03-20,Counselling for Family Members of Patients in Palliative Care,013-001-094-070-001,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"For instance, at St Joseph's Home, counselling actually begins at the point of referral of a patient and the family members into palliative care. The multi-disciplinary team, which comprises the consultants, the nurses, as well as social care staff, will engage the patient as well as the family members in conversations on advance care planning, end-of-life preferences, coping with grief and so on. Counselling usually happens as a natural conversation and is a work-in-progress in that sense. It is an on-going process, as part of palliative care.",2,7,013-001-094-070-001-007,7
2018-03-20,Counselling for Family Members of Patients in Palliative Care,013-001-094-070-001,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"In terms of promoting the awareness about end-of-life issues and palliative care services, MOH continues to work with Singapore Hospice Council (SHC) as well as various community partners and providers. For instance, we work with SHC on a community engagement programme. We have a three-year partnership with them from 2017 to 2019 on this community engagement programme to raise awareness among the public about palliative care services as well as end-of-life issues.",3,8,013-001-094-070-001-008,8
2018-03-20,Counselling for Family Members of Patients in Palliative Care,013-001-094-070-001,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We will continue to do so and extend this outreach in terms of raising awareness and also, improving the quality of end-of-life care and extend this to psycho-social support. That will include supportive counselling of patients and their family members.",4,9,013-001-094-070-001-009,9

2018-03-20,Subsidies for Incontinence Treatment,013-001-094-070-002,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Health),"  Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank Er Dr Lee Bee Wah for raising this important question on behalf of her residents. We certainly share her view that for seniors suffering from incontinence, we would encourage them to seek treatment early. We do not have data on the total number of seniors suffering from incontinence, as patients could be seeing their doctors for other primary conditions such as urinary infection, prostate problems or post-stroke treatment, which include treatment for incontinence.",1,2,013-001-094-070-002-002,11
2018-03-20,Subsidies for Incontinence Treatment,013-001-094-070-002,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Health),"Mr Speaker, over the past three years, around 2,900 seniors aged 65 years and above received subsidised treatment specifically for incontinence at polyclinics and Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) General Practitioners (GPs). This would be a subset of the total number of seniors seeking treatment for incontinence.",2,3,013-001-094-070-002-003,12

The cost and treatment required for each patient will depend on the nature and severity of his condition.",3,4,013-001-094-070-002-004,13
2018-03-20,Subsidies for Incontinence Treatment,013-001-094-070-002,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Health),Seniors receive subsidies of up to 75% when they visit polyclinics.

2018-03-20,Subsidies for Incontinence Treatment,013-001-094-070-002,Mr Chee Hong Tat,"  Mr Speaker, I thank Dr Tan for his supplementary question. Indeed, I think he is right that the help that we provide to our residents suffering from incontinence is not just for treatment but also in other areas like consumables. Diapers, for example. If seniors require adult diapers, they can apply for assistance under the Seniors Mobility and Enabling Fund (SMF). The fund provides means-tested subsidies – 50% or 80% subsidies – for consumables such as diapers.",1,9,013-001-094-070-002-009,18

2018-03-20,Small Fires on Expressways or Roads Caused by Cigarette Butts,013-001-094-070-003,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"  Mr Speaker, the SCDF only started keeping records of roadside vegetation fires from 2014. Between 2014 and 2017, SCDF attended to about 350 such fires annually. Most of these fires were caused by cigarette butts.",1,2,013-001-094-070-003-002,21

Among other measures, NEA regularly clears the roads of dry leaves, which are more susceptible to catching fire.",2,3,013-001-094-070-003-003,22
2018-03-20,Small Fires on Expressways or Roads Caused by Cigarette Butts,013-001-094-070-003,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Home Affairs),"But no amount of clearing will help, if some members of the public continue to illegally and irresponsibly discard cigarette butts. Such persons can be charged under the Environmental Public Health Act for littering at the least, and if we can prove the fact and the fires also cause serious damage, such persons can be charged under the Penal Code for fire-related offences. We encourage the public to report such offences via NEA's website, its mobile app or its hotline.",3,4,013-001-094-070-003-004,23

2018-03-20,Small Fires on Expressways or Roads Caused by Cigarette Butts,013-001-094-070-003,Mrs Josephine Teo,"  Mr Speaker, the Member asked a very good question. It is actually quite difficult. When you think of a vegetation fire, the fact is that it would not have started immediately, let us say, when a cigarette butt is discarded. It would take some time. So, hypothetically, even if someone happens to be at the right spot, at the right time, and manages to capture on camera or through video someone who had thrown a cigarette butt, it is not so easy to establish whether that particular fire started as a result of that particular littering incident.",1,6,013-001-094-070-003-006,25
2018-03-20,Small Fires on Expressways or Roads Caused by Cigarette Butts,013-001-094-070-003,Mrs Josephine Teo,"There are no easy ways to prevent, except to appeal to people's civic-mindedness, except to make it a habit of reminding people that whenever you discard a cigarette butt, whether it is in a housing estate or anywhere, that could lead to some other situation, such as a fire. That is why the NEA takes a very strict view of littering, especially when someone were to throw a cigarette butt. I am sure, as Members of Parliament, we have received appeals from our residents who tell us, ""It was just that once"" or ""I wasn't thinking"". But yet, the NEA will have to take a strict view and really because, if it does result in a fire, it is not so easy to prove who did it. And yet, the damage could be serious.",2,7,013-001-094-070-003-007,26

2018-03-20,Smoke and Fire Alarms for HDB Rental Flats,013-001-094-070-004,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo),"  Mr Speaker, MHA announced in November last year that SCDF, HDB and PA were working together to provide free installation of home fire alarm devices, or HFADs, for all 60,000 public rental flats.",1,2,013-001-094-070-004-002,28

2018-03-20,Smoke and Fire Alarms for HDB Rental Flats,013-001-094-070-004,Mrs Josephine Teo,"  I thank the Member for asking those two questions. The first answer is yes. I made the announcement and I had explained then that between HDB and SCDF, they have reached an agreement. Because of the unique circumstances of rental flat tenants, we have decided that the installation will be for all rental units.",1,6,013-001-094-070-004-006,32
2018-03-20,Smoke and Fire Alarms for HDB Rental Flats,013-001-094-070-004,Mrs Josephine Teo,"To the second question, if Er Dr Lee Bee Wah did not ask that question, I would be rather surprised. It probably would have been someone else in disguise. I would be very happy if Nee Soon South was in the first phase. But if it is not in the first phase, then it would be in the second phase or perhaps in the third phase. The good news is that everything would be done by 2021.",2,7,013-001-094-070-004-007,33

2018-03-20,Mediations Handled by Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management,013-001-094-070-005,The Second Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Manpower),"  Mr Speaker, the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) was set up in April 2017, slightly under a year ago, and its purpose was to help employees and employers manage and resolve employment disputes. This includes both salary and non-salary-related disputes. A large majority of the disputes received by TADM are salary-related disputes which are governed under the Employment Claims Act (ECA), where mediation is compulsory. For non-salary disputes, voluntary mediation is offered.",1,2,013-001-094-070-005-002,37

Twelve percent were not settled as parties were unable to work out a settlement. These cases were then referred to the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT) for adjudication. The remaining 9% were claims involving non-attendance at mediation. In other words, someone did not show up.",3,4,013-001-094-070-005-004,39
2018-03-20,Mediations Handled by Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management,013-001-094-070-005,The Second Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Manpower),"One-third of the non-attendance cases were closed as the claimants themselves did not show up. For the remaining two-thirds, when respondents did not attend mediation, claimants could have their claims heard and adjudicated by the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT), even if respondents do not turn up for the hearing. Where there are good grounds, the ECT can and will make a payment order in favour of claimants, for the full claimed amount. As a consequence of non-attendance, the ECT may also order the respondents to pay costs to the claimants.",4,5,013-001-094-070-005-005,40

This is higher than the figure cited in recent media reports, which only covers the National Recycling Programme (NRP).

For example, from 1 April this year, all new non-landed private residential developments above four storeys will need to provide dual chutes for refuse and recyclables. These dual chutes have already been introduced in new HDB Build-to-Order flats since January 2014.

Section 8M also requires operators to provide information when requested by LTA for enforcement purposes.

Today, the PPA allows LTA to make rules on the number of parking places or spaces to be provided on any type of land or buildings. Private developments have to provide a specified minimum number of parking lots. Clause 17 introduces a new section 22 which empowers LTA to make rules prescribing the range of parking lots which private developers have to provide, defined by a lower and/or upper limit.

The LTA should also set up mobile enforcement teams to act against reckless cyclists and PMD users based on feedback from the public. In the facilitation of enforcement, a telephone hotline to gather information from the public on “hot spots” or accident-prone areas will be of great value.

The amendment to the Bill has with it, the intention to move Singapore towards a car-lite society. Though the Bill aims to implement a licensing regime on dock-less bicycle-sharing operators to address the problem of indiscriminate parking; and to better manage provision of parking by private developments to support our car-lite vision, however, we need to also calibrate the regulations, monitor and evaluate the parking measures if this invariably results in less take-up of bicycle sharing as a result of this Bill.",1,76,013-001-094-070-010-076,156

While there must be regulations, it should not be a deterrent to the market players with high barriers to entry.

However, the responsibility should not lie solely on the operators, but also on the end user. Having said that, imposing fines as punitive measures alone may not be the best idea to discourage adverse behaviour, but rather to reward good positive behaviour.

As bus interchanges, MRT stations and HDB and private housing estates are common destination stops, more purpose-built metal bicycle racks and parking areas could be built as official geo-tagged parking zones.

If so, would the Minister mandate a certain percentage of the extra space to benefit the public and the community?

The lower carpark provision should also translate to facilities that can benefit members of the public.

At the moment, there is still no requirement for private bicycles or PMD owners to register ownership of such vehicles, and if they also indiscriminately park their vehicles in public places, then no enforcement action can be taken on them. Are there plans to require private bicycle or PMD owners to be registered so that proper monitoring of indiscriminate parking and subsequent enforcement can be carried out?",4,135,013-001-094-070-010-135,215

What enforcement actions can be taken on errant or irresponsible users or hirers of shared vehicles? And since there are numerous users or hirers of shared vehicles, will monetary fines be the only form of enforcement to be meted out to irresponsible users for indiscriminate parking?

Hence, for the shared vehicle operators, how does LTA plan to impose the standards of performance such as the use of geo-fencing technology or monetary fines to minimise or eradicate indiscriminate parking of the shared vehicles under their licence? Will vehicle docking systems, for instance, be imposed on these operators should they fail to comply with the requirements for proper parking of their shared vehicles such as through the use of geo-fencing technology? Will current LTA enforcement officers be sufficient to carry out checks to ensure adherence to the required standards of performance by the shared vehicle operators, or will more enforcement officers need to be recruited?",6,137,013-001-094-070-010-137,217

To elaborate, when such dispatch riders or food deliverers need to deliver whatever items as assigned as part of their job at these buildings or places, they would park their vehicles at a spot in a public area while they go about delivering the items as assigned, since there are no designated parking lots for motorcycles there. Examples of such buildings are DBS Building, Marina Bay Sands and Novena Hospital, from what I understand, though I may stand corrected. Can LTA work with the management of such private developments to provide designated Interim Parking Lots for dispatch riders and food deliverers to park their motorcycles or PMDs for free for a period of no more than 10 to 15 minutes so that they would not get parking offence summonses and would not obstruct traffic or pedestrian access?

QR codes complement the accuracy of GPS-based geo-fencing. Safeguards will be put in place to reasonably ensure that the scanning of static QR code geo-fencing cannot be “gamed”. Each parking location will have a unique QR code and users will only be allowed to end their trip if the scanned QR code matches the GPS location of the parking location. For example, if users take a photo of a QR code and use it to park anywhere outside of the specified parking location, they will not be able to end their trip because the QR code does not match with the GPS location of the shared bicycle. Where a QR code has been vandalised, users will still be allowed to end their trip if they take a photograph of their bicycle parked within the bicycle parking area and submit it within the operator’s application.

Under the Street Works Act, LTA can fine users who are identified as parking improperly. However, it is often difficult to catch users red-handed. As operators can track the whereabouts of their bicycles, they are better-placed to detect and prevent indiscriminate parking from occurring in the first place.

Through geo-fencing, if users do not return their vehicle to a proper parking area, they will not be able to end their trip and will continue to be charged by the operators.

It is understandable and commendable, therefore, that the Government has chosen a soft start and an incremental approach by imposing a lower tax per tonne of emission at the beginning and increasing the same over time. The carbon credit system has also been lauded for allowing for some flexibility.

There has already been a buzz about increases in prices of food and drinks at coffee shops. Some businesses have attributed the increases in cost, to the cost of water as well as to the prospective increase in GST and the carbon tax, even when they have yet to be imposed. I therefore wonder if there is any way for the Government to monitor the knock-on effect of the implementation of the carbon tax to consumers and put in place some regulation to avoid unfair profiteering.

Our daily activities usually generate carbon that will pollute the air and destroy the environment. Most of the carbon in the air is emitted by certain industries. Under this new legislation, certain companies will be taxed based on their carbon emissions. The money that needs to be set aside for this carbon tax will nudge these companies into paying more attention to carbon emissions and find new ways to be more productive and environmentally-friendly.",11,147,013-001-094-070-011-147,447

On average, the additional U-Save rebates will cover the expected increase in electricity and gas expenses arising from the carbon tax. This will help HDB households to adjust to the carbon tax, as they reduce their utilities consumption over time.

Lawyers who want to retire and dissolve their law practices, but who are holding onto unclaimed client moneys, are in a difficult position. They either have to find another practising lawyer willing to take over the administration of the client account, or they would be unable to retire and must continue to bear the expenses of maintaining their law practices and these client accounts.",15,16,013-001-094-070-012-016,544

These requirements will be prescribed by the Law Society Council with the Minister's approval, and will include what reasonable efforts the solicitor or Singapore law practice should have made to return the money, before the Society will approve a transfer. Such ""reasonable efforts"" will take various circumstances into account, for example, more robust steps may be required in the case of larger amounts, and account may be taken of practical issues which may arise in cases of very old client accounts.

This amendment puts into effect the recommendation of the Study Committee on Professional Standards and Etiquette in Court under the auspices of the Singapore Academy of Law’s Professional Affairs Committee.",32,33,013-001-094-070-012-033,561
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The intention is to prescribe that solicitors who practise in the area of litigation will need to complete a short online test on professional conduct rules administered by the Law Society and declare that they have done the test before applying for or renewing their practising certificates. The test is not intended to be an onerous requirement but will serve as a self-learning and self-assessment tool, to remind solicitors of their obligations as members of a noble profession. This will propagate good practices as well as reinforce and serve as a useful reminder of changes relevant to the practice area. Council also has the powers to exempt a solicitor or a class of solicitors from making a declaration, if the Council is satisfied that the solicitor or the class of solicitors is already equipped with the knowledge and skills required for practice in that area of the law.",33,34,013-001-094-070-012-034,562
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Second  Currently, the Law Society Council is only able to apply interest, dividends and other accretions of capital arising from the Compensation Fund which consists of contributions from solicitors, to purchase and maintain a library for its members’ use. Clause 19 of the Bill makes amendments to provide Council with greater flexibility to use such interest, dividends and other accretions of capital towards a wider range of worthwhile causes.",34,35,013-001-094-070-012-035,563
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Third  Clause 17 of the Bill allows penalty sums which are collected from solicitors who fail to vote at the annual election of Law Society Council members to be credited to the Law Society, instead of the Compensation Fund.",35,36,013-001-094-070-012-036,564
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Fourth  Clause 4 of the Bill extends an exception relating to the requirements for a practising certificate, which are currently applicable to solicitors employed by the Law Society, to those employed by wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Law Society.",36,37,013-001-094-070-012-037,565
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Fifth  Clause 30 of the Bill allows Singapore law practices which are structured as law corporations and limited liability law partnerships to form a group law practice. Currently, only Singapore law practices structured as sole proprietorships and partnerships may form a group law practice. This updates the group law practice scheme which was introduced prior to the introduction of law corporations and limited liability law partnerships.",37,38,013-001-094-070-012-038,566
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),Sixth  Clause 25 of the Bill clarifies that a senior judge of the Supreme Court of Singapore can be appointed to sit as the President of the Disciplinary Tribunal.,38,39,013-001-094-070-012-039,567
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"And last  Clauses 5, 6 and 7 of the Bill repeals section 36F of the current Act and makes consequential amendments as this category of registration of lawyers has been subsumed into other legislation categories under the regulatory regime and is no longer needed.",39,40,013-001-094-070-012-040,568
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"In summary, all these amendments that I have mentioned will ensure that our framework for the legal industry continues to remain up-to-date and responsive to changes in the legal landscape. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.",40,41,013-001-094-070-012-041,569
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),Question proposed.,41,42,013-001-094-070-012-042,570
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)," Sir, two of the three stated objectives in the long title of the Legal Profession Act are to constitute the Law Society and to amend and consolidate the law relating to the legal profession.",1,43,013-001-094-070-012-043,571
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The legal profession plays an important role − an integral role − in the administration of justice in our rule of law society. Through ways such as providing legal advice, representation and promoting legal literacy through education, lawyers play an important role in access to justice. This Bill furthers their efforts and the legal profession’s contribution to society.",2,44,013-001-094-070-012-044,572
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Firstly, this Bill facilitates the Law Society to perform functions and activities better. It provides for wholly-owned subsidiaries which would allow the Law Society to make use of separate legal entities to perform functions and activities.",3,45,013-001-094-070-012-045,573
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),One of these functions could be pro bono services as clause 4 also allows solicitors employed under the wholly-owned subsidiary to apply for a practising certificate. This is also supplemented through clause 19 that allows the wholly-owned subsidiary to use accretions to capital from the Compensation Fund.,4,46,013-001-094-070-012-046,574
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Through the new section 70J(3)(b), the new Unclaimed Money Fund would also complement that financial support for the Law Society’s pro bono services and the activities of a wholly-owned subsidiary. These amendments would support the on-going pro bono efforts by the Law Society.",5,47,013-001-094-070-012-047,575
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"At this point in time, I should declare that I am a legal practitioner at the Singapore Bar.",6,48,013-001-094-070-012-048,576
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"One of the stated missions of the Law Society is to ensure access to justice for all, and one way this has been done is through pro bono services. Some of the excellent work is reflected in the Community Legal Clinic Scheme, the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme and the Ad Hoc Pro Bono Referral.",7,49,013-001-094-070-012-049,577
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Not restricted to individuals, the Law Society also works with VWOs and charities who are unable to afford legal consultation and representation due to limited resources. Law Awareness seeks to ""break 'legal jargon'"" into accessible ""easy-to-understand elements"" for the public through talks, exhibits, resource materials. Therefore, these welcome amendments enhance the Law Society’s contributions to our community.",8,50,013-001-094-070-012-050,578
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Secondly, Sir, the Bill furthers the drive to make Singapore a robust regional and global legal hub. Clause 30 introduces a new Division 5 that would regulate group practices in Singapore by Singapore and foreign law practices. This provides for another option that law practices may choose to organise themselves within, allowing for more flexibility in how practices may choose to position themselves in the legal industry.",9,51,013-001-094-070-012-051,579
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"This Bill also provides for law experts to appear before the Singapore International Commercial Court and relevant appeals in the Court of Appeal. The expertise from which the SICC can draw on in a proceeding is no longer limited to practising solicitors, persons admitted under section 15 ad hoc admissions or foreign lawyers registered under section 36P. But these legal experts serve a separate function. They come into the picture when the SICC orders that a question of foreign law be determined on the basis of submissions, instead of proof.",10,52,013-001-094-070-012-052,580
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Thirdly, this Bill seeks to further regulate the Bar. On this theme, I have two clarifications for the Minister.",11,53,013-001-094-070-012-053,581
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Firstly, I would like to ask for an elaboration on clause 20, new section 75E, which provides for declaration of practice areas on practising certificates, unless exempted. May I ask the Minister what is the thought behind this and how would it work?",12,54,013-001-094-070-012-054,582
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"My second clarification for the Minister is on the introduction and expansion of remedial measures. While it may provide for an intermediate option in addressing situations, the Bill sets few parameters on what kind of remedial measures Council can make under the new section 97A. While Ministerial approval is necessary, it seems as though the power is constrained only by the purpose of the rule, that is, new section 97A paragraph (a) which says ""to address any issue concerning the professional practice, etiquette, conduct of discipline of a regulated legal practitioner"" and paragraph (b) ""any requirements that Council may specify for compliance with an order of the Council under section 88(1A) or 94(3A)"".",13,55,013-001-094-070-012-055,583
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The latter seems to include warning, reprimand, and financial penalty as remedial orders. My clarification for the good Minister is this  why are the safeguards in section 88(2) and section 88(3) not extended to the new subsections (1A) and (1B) even though they may carry similar consequences?",14,56,013-001-094-070-012-056,584
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"In short, my position is that  any remedial actions must also be fair to the practitioners, and the process in deciding whether a remedial action should be administered should also be fair to the practitioner.",15,57,013-001-094-070-012-057,585
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Fourthly, Sir, through the setting up of the Unpaid Money Fund, clients’ interests continue to be safeguarded, while providing a practical solution for some solicitors’ conundrum. These changes would allow lawyers who wish to retire to do so, by relieving lawyers of the burden and expense of maintaining the client account. This is especially pertinent as the solution mechanism of ""intervention money"" being paid into the Compensation Fund does not reflect our current legal industry landscape where law firms may not always continue across generations.",16,58,013-001-094-070-012-058,586
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Hence, the Unpaid Money Fund would allow solicitors to avoid this conundrum in the future. Furthermore, these unclaimed monies can be used for a public good. The new section 70J(3)(b) in clause 18 provides that it can be used for ""pro bono services provided by the Law Society or by any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Society"".",17,59,013-001-094-070-012-059,587
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, even as this solution provides a win-win situation for the community and the relevant solicitor, it will also provide sufficient safeguards to ensure client’s interests are not compromised. The purpose under which a solicitor may apply to transfer money into the Unclaimed Money Fund will be restricted under section 70J(2) and (3). Claims against the Fund are also allowed up to six years after the transfer, after which the Society still retains the discretion to pay part or whole of the amount being claimed. In this manner, the Unclaimed Money Fund provides a practical win-win solution for all.",18,60,013-001-094-070-012-060,588
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"Sir, the Legal Profession has an important role in ensuring that Singapore remains a country run on the rule of Law. This Bill augments that aim and, therefore, I support it.",19,61,013-001-094-070-012-061,589
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"  Mr Deputy Speaker, I declare my interest as a practising lawyer.",1,62,013-001-094-070-012-062,590
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),The Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill introduces various amendments to the Legal Profession Act. The introduction of a further disciplinary option that can be imposed against an errant legal practitioner and the creation of the Unclaimed Money Funds are noteworthy innovations that should be welcomed by Members of this House.,2,63,013-001-094-070-012-063,591
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),I wish to make three short points on the proposed amendments.,3,64,013-001-094-070-012-064,592
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"First, clause 17 of the Bill proposes to amend section 50 of the Act to allow for the penalty paid by any lawyer for failing to vote in council elections to be paid to the Law Society and not the Compensation Fund. The Compensation Fund is a fund administered by the Council of the Law Society to serve a public purpose in that grants may be paid out of the Fund to mitigate loss suffered by any person due to dishonesty of a lawyer or a member of his staff.",4,65,013-001-094-070-012-065,593
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"A similar amendment was made in 2001 for penalties paid as a result of disciplinary proceedings to be paid to the Society, instead of the Consolidated Fund, so that the Law Society could use the monies for worthy causes, such as providing pro bono services or creating legal awareness.",5,66,013-001-094-070-012-066,594
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In these circumstances, what is the purpose behind the change, and will the monies directed to the Society be also used for similar worthy causes to serve public interest? What would be the consequent effect on the Compensation Fund, in terms of its funding level, if the monies were to be channelled to the Society? Would the Fund have sufficient funds to meet claims from members of public? Also, given that the Law Society has just moved to e-voting recently, what is the expected amount of revenue generated for use by the Society from penalties for failing to vote?",6,67,013-001-094-070-012-067,595
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Second, the Bill introduces the establishment of a new Unclaimed Money Fund to allow for the transfer of unclaimed client or intervention monies to be paid into the Fund and to vest in the Law Society absolutely. At the same time, it does not appear that the proposed amendments require the Law Society to take reasonable efforts to return the monies to the owners.",7,68,013-001-094-070-012-068,596
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In this regard, I note that the hon Senior Minister of State stated that the Law Society requires solicitors to expend reasonable efforts before they are being allowed to transfer those monies to the Law Society. But vis-à-vis the Law Society itself is not clear what steps the Law Society would have to undertake and who checks on the Society in relation to the steps the Law Society would have to undertake to locate these claimants or potential claimants.",8,69,013-001-094-070-012-069,597
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In the context of Government agencies, MOF had made a statement that all Government agencies, including Statutory Boards, are required to make all reasonable efforts to return unclaimed monies to the rightful owners promptly. This being the case, what can be done to ensure that the Law Society expends sufficient efforts to contact the rightful owners of these monies before it decides to use these monies for pro bono services?",9,70,013-001-094-070-012-070,598
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Finally, the proposed amendments to the Act expands the range of measures that may be imposed by the Inquiry Committee, the Council and the Disciplinary Tribunal to include remedial measures to be taken by the legal practitioner.",10,71,013-001-094-070-012-071,599
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"Given the breadth of professional conduct rules legal practitioners are bound by, could the hon Senior Minister of State please clarify what kind of remedial measures are contemplated, and in what situations would remedial measures be imposed? I believe the hon Member Mr Christopher de Souza made a similar request.",11,72,013-001-094-070-012-072,600
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"In this regard, I wonder if there is any reason for the proposed amendments not to provide for the Court of Three Judges, which sits at the apex of the disciplinary process to also impose remedial measures. Would the hon Senior Minister of State accept that the absence of the empowering provision does not curtail the powers of the Court of Three Judges to impose requirements on legal practitioners, such as undertakings to the court which may mirror obligations imposed through the remedial measures? Notwithstanding the clarifications I raised, I support the Bill.",12,73,013-001-094-070-012-073,601
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)," Sir, I stand in support of this Bill. Lawyers I spoke to welcome, in particular, three changes that have been proposed.",1,74,013-001-094-070-012-074,602
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The first relates to the appointment of law experts in cases before the Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC), a move, no doubt, put in place to improve the quality of arguments raised in the SICC on foreign law issues.",2,75,013-001-094-070-012-075,603
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The second relates to the establishment of an Unclaimed Money Fund to be administered by the Law Society of Singapore. The amendment will result in certain monies that are unclaimed being put to use in amongst other things, pro bono services.",3,76,013-001-094-070-012-076,604
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Finally, there is the introduction of the imposition of remedial measures upon a regulated legal practitioner by the Council of the Law Society of Singapore or the Disciplinary Tribunal.",4,77,013-001-094-070-012-077,605
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Previously, the options were limited to the issuance of a warning, a reprimand or the imposition of a fine. These were aimed at censuring and punishing the errant regulated legal practitioner and may not have addressed root causes for the impeached conduct.",5,78,013-001-094-070-012-078,606
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"While the precise type of remedial measures that may be imposed will be set out in further subsidiary legislation, it is heartening to see that there is now another option available, which is not entirely punitive in nature.",6,79,013-001-094-070-012-079,607
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"However, it is with this last change that I now seek clarifications. The Bill proposes to allow an Inquiry Committee to recommend to the Council of the Law Society of Singapore that a penalty, warning, reprimand, and/or requirement of compliance with remedial measures be imposed on a practitioner, without any formal investigation by a Disciplinary Tribunal. The Council of the Law Society can then make such a determination under the new section 87 of the Act.",7,80,013-001-094-070-012-080,608
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Significantly, the amendment to section 88(1) proposes to make the imposition of a penalty, warning and/or reprimand mandatory by changing the wording to ""must give"" from the original ""may give"". The question is, why are we changing from a ""may"" to a ""must""?",8,81,013-001-094-070-012-081,609
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Lawyers I have spoken to are concerned about the mandatory imposition because this seems to render the practitioner's opportunity to be heard on the matter under section 88(3) futile.,9,82,013-001-094-070-012-082,610
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In the interest of fairness and in line with the right to be heard, the practitioner really ought to be able to make her or his case on the matter and section 88(3) should remain. Can the Senior Minister of State clarify how section 88(3) is consistent with the mandatory imposition under section 88(1)?",10,83,013-001-094-070-012-083,611
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Further, I note that the imposition of the remedial measures by Council is sought to be introduced by way of a new section 88(1A), but section 88(3) of the Act remains unchanged. This seems to suggest that a practitioner will not be heard before remedial measures are imposed upon him or her by the Council.",11,84,013-001-094-070-012-084,612
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Can the Senior Minister of State clarify whether a practitioner also has the right to be heard before Council imposes remedial measures on him in the same spirit of fairness?,12,85,013-001-094-070-012-085,613

I am heartened therefore by the further enhancements that I believe will ensure that the high standards expected of the profession, will be maintained.",2,88,013-001-094-070-012-088,616
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),I wish to record my observations on several proposed amendments in this Bill.,3,89,013-001-094-070-012-089,617
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Firstly, I note clauses 22, 23, 24 and 26 to 29 of the Bill relate to amendments to expand the range of measures that may be imposed in disciplinary proceedings to include remedial measures. This is a laudable move in that it allows for a suite of more nuanced, meaningful and fair sanctions. The profession calls for high standards of conduct and I believe we should continue to assert this. However, it is important to have regulation that seeks to encourage good behaviour and rehabilitate undesirable conduct; instead of being merely punitive. I therefore hope that in its application, the directions or orders for remedial measures will help to encourage better conduct amongst the lawyers who had faced the disciplinary proceedings.",4,90,013-001-094-070-012-090,618
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Secondly, I note the introduction of the new Part VB relating to the Unclaimed Money Fund. This is definitely a welcomed move. For far too long, lawyers have had difficulties in dealing with monies put in as deposit by clients or deposited in favour of the clients, who subsequently cannot be reached. Lawyers are required to keep monies belonging to clients in the client's account, until there is a proper invoice or proper instructions are given for monies to be paid out. When the clients cannot be contacted, the lawyer then has difficulties. There have been situations where the lawyer cannot close the firm because of this outstanding issue. Typically, the lawyer would ask another lawyer to take over the account but this can be a hassle. The issue is now resolved with the introduction of the Unclaimed Money Fund.",5,91,013-001-094-070-012-091,619
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I appreciate the effort in calibrating the provisions of this new section to be fair to the lawyer, the Law Society as well as the client, especially if he or she does show up or eventually if he or she does show up and claim the monies. I note that the effect of the proposed sections 70K(3) and 70K(4) is that the lawyer may potentially face a claim from a client that resurfaces within six years from the time the unclaimed money is transferred to the Law Society. I appreciate that the proposed clause 70L allows for a channel for the client or claimant to apply to the Law Society for payment of the whole or part of the unclaimed money and upon payment, the Law Society and lawyer are discharged from liability to the claimant for the amount paid. In these circumstances, may I seek clarification on the intent of section 70K(4) as there would be a wait of six years before the lawyer is discharged and free from any liability?",6,92,013-001-094-070-012-092,620
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),I am heartened that there is provision in the proposed section 70L(5) to deal with situations where claims come in after the expiry of the six-year period. I believe this reflects reasonableness and compassion; values which should be upheld by the fraternity.,7,93,013-001-094-070-012-093,621
2018-03-20,Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-070-012,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"The final point I wish to raise is on the usage of the monies in the Unclaimed Money Fund. I note that the monies forming part of the Fund may be used to fund amongst other things, pro bono services provided by the Law Society. The provision of pro bono services, in my view, is a key component within the community as it helps to augment the existing Legal Aid scheme that is available. I hope that with the access to this new Fund, there would be more resources and additional effort to bridge any gaps in the provision of legal services, especially to those who may not meet the criteria to obtain Legal Aid.",8,94,013-001-094-070-012-094,622

These remedial measures can be imposed in addition to or in lieu of the current options which are available.

These provide for a more nuanced, tailored and effective means to address the root causes of certain types of misconduct as well as reduce recidivism.
