2022-09-12,Assessing Cases based on Hoarding Management Framework,014-001-095-067-003,Ms Sim Ann,"  Thank you. Sir, compulsive hoarding is characterised by the excessive acquisition of items that are of little or no value and an inability or unwillingness to discard them. While hoarders’ homes may be filled from floor to ceiling with what most may deem as ""rubbish"", they view these items as important and cannot bear to part with them. In the most severe cases, the hoarder may even rough sleep outside their homes as there is hardly any space left inside. Internationally, the Clutter Image Rating Scale (CIRS) is used to measure the extent and severity of hoarding.",1,10,014-001-095-067-003-010,54
2022-09-12,Assessing Cases based on Hoarding Management Framework,014-001-095-067-003,Ms Sim Ann,"The root cause of a hoarder's behaviour is complex. For example, one's hoarding could be a symptom of underlying mental health conditions like Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), or developed after trauma or deep grief. Hoarding behaviours could also be exacerbated by social factors, such as disputes with one's family or the stockpiling of collected items at home for one’s “karang guni” business. Hoarding strikes people of all ages.

A hoarded home may be infested with pests from rotting food or pose a fire risk as occupants may be unable to escape in an emergency due to blockages to exit routes from the extreme accumulation of clutter. Hoarding that clutters corridors also obstructs evacuation routes for neighbours in times of fire. The emanating stench may also inconvenience neighbours and be a nuisance by preventing them from enjoying living in their own homes. These public health and safety risks and dis-amenities warrant state intervention for the well-being of both the hoarder and the community.",3,12,014-001-095-067-003-012,56

The Hoarding Management Core Group (HMCG), led by the Municipal Services Office (MSO), was set up in 2014 to coordinate efforts across agencies and resolve protracted and severe hoarding cases.

Where risks are identified to the extent that established rules and laws are violated, regulatory agencies will issue orders or take enforcement action on the hoarder or homeowner. For example, NEA may order the owner to remove items contributing to pest infestations in their home, while SCDF may order the owner to cease hoarding flammable items, such as fuel. AVS will also act against hoarding of animals within a HDB flat where animal welfare is harmed, or Town Councils may require owners to remove hoarding in the common areas.",5,14,014-001-095-067-003-014,58

Agencies work closely with healthcare workers, community partners such as social workers from Family Service Centres, grassroots leaders, volunteers and the hoarders' family members in a concerted effort to resolve hoarding cases.

The individual is very much a part of the picture and sometimes not being able to contact the individual or evasive actions taken by the individual to avoid anyone speaking with him or her, or gaining entry to his or her flat, very often that can delay action very considerably. Also, the degree to which the family members are supportive makes a very clear difference on the ground.

Can I ask if there could be dedicated mental health or social support resources set aside for cases specifically under the Hoarding Management Framework, so that more attention can be given to resolve such cases very quickly?",1,37,014-001-095-067-004-037,104

On behalf of the MSO which chairs HMCG, I would like nothing better than to see more resources being devoted to this issue by all the agencies that are working with us.",1,38,014-001-095-067-004-038,105
2022-09-12,Review of Fire Safety Standards for HDB Blocks and Installation of Home Fire Alarm Devices for all HDB Public Rental Flats,014-001-095-067-004,Ms Sim Ann,"However, working closely with them, we also understand that there are different professional considerations. For instance, what we have learnt from our mental health colleagues is that hoarding itself is not an illness or a condition. It is an expression of underlying conditions which can be quite varied. And therefore, in terms of dealing with the root cause, every case is different.",2,39,014-001-095-067-004-039,106

Access to the individual, the ability to engage the individual, some awareness or response by the individual and strong support from the family members are very important, not just in terms of addressing the behavioural manifestation, in terms of the hoarding, but also whatever underlying cause could have contributed to this behaviour in the first place.",3,40,014-001-095-067-004-040,107

I would like to check with the Senior Minister of State  is there a time frame to the enforcement order to be taken? Some cases are very complicated; I personally have come across a resident's case – after years of trying, the hoarding issue still cannot be solved. The family members are seeking help, they are in distress that one of their family members has this habit. This poses safety concerns to the family.

First of all, within HMCG, we already have a framework and as I have also shared with Members just now, we have managed to see progress in some of the cases.

I wanted to seek clarification from the Minister of State for Home Affairs, whether SCDF indeed have the authority to carry out enforcement or issue decluttering notices to household with excessive hoarding, especially those that pose fire risks? If yes, is the Ministry or SCDF stepping up these inspections and issuing such notices? If no, would the Ministry consider empowering SCDF with this authority so that they can ensure fire safety in our residential areas?",1,47,014-001-095-067-004-047,114

As I shared earlier, SCDF does not assess cluttered homes, in general, to be a key fire risk. So, at the end of the day, we have to look at the different cases.

MOE is mindful that the quality of education depends on the strength of our teaching force, and teachers' well-being is critically important to our mission to teach, inspire and nurture future generations. We are heartened by the public support for the salary and benefits adjustments to MOE-specific schemes, so that our educators continue to be competitively remunerated.

MOE values our teachers, and pays close attention to their well-being and work-life balance. Many of our dedicated teachers go above and beyond the call of duty for our students. To help teachers manage their workload, we have supported schools and teachers by streamlining administrative processes such as taking attendance electronically, centrally providing services such as demand aggregation for common purchases and giving schools greater flexibility to pace the implementation of new initiatives. This allows teachers to focus their time on student-centric work, including CCAs and counselling.",2,7,014-001-095-067-005-007,122

This is one area which I hope that, for the many parents out there, beyond saying what parents could help, maybe we could consider drawing clear boundaries on where parents should not or cannot do because I think many teachers that I spoke to also said that one of the things that stress them is what parents are imposing on them, either directly or indirectly.

We certainly have our fair share of them. But, perhaps, one difficult parent can take up a substantial amount of time from the teachers, which then makes it unfair for the teachers to take care of the rest. But just to pay tribute to some of the parent support groups which have done well in this. We have many examples of parent support groups – and I have met them recently – who have come forward to help the teachers and the schools to manage many of these things – from curriculum to how to role model a positive relationship between parents and teachers. For example, Admiralty Secondary School, Crest Secondary School and Fuhua Primary School all have very strong parent support groups which work with the teachers to bring about a better outcome in our schools.",6,22,014-001-095-067-005-022,137

But having said that, it is true that there are some parents who may not abide by some of the rules in this code of conduct that we have mentioned. Some negative examples would be like going after the teachers for the slightest of issues which require the teachers to spend an inordinate amount of time to try to answer those questions.",7,23,014-001-095-067-005-023,138

Perhaps, in the larger scheme of things, sometimes, it is useful for us to take a step back and ask ourselves what is the kind of environment we want in the schools in order for us to bring up our children who are independent, resilient and creative. And, sometimes, if we overdo things by removing all uncertainties, difficulties and untidiness from the child's life, it may not be the best way for us to bring up our children.",9,25,014-001-095-067-005-025,140

This is something that we need to leave to the hospitals and public healthcare institutions to manage. It is an operational setting and setting too much rules does not help. It will be counter-productive. The reality is, even if we set the rules, the professionals, even if they are going to leave their shift, if they see a patient who is unwell, they would also still stay and still want to take care of the patient.

Over the past decade, Singaporean workers have experienced real wage growth. Wages have exceeded inflation. We do not have real wage growth figures for 2022 yet, as the data will only be available later this year. But we know that inflation has gone up in this year and that is why the Government will continue to provide support for Singaporeans to mitigate the impact of higher prices.

In particular, stamp duty collection accounted for the largest share of the tax revenue increase in FY2021. The property market has recovered at a much faster rate than many market observers had anticipated. But just as a bullish property market can provide upsides, there can also be downsides in a muted market, as past experience has shown.

Frankly, no one I know can predict what property prices would be next year. And all the market observers never expected the property market to recover as strongly as it did.

Just two supplementary questions. Firstly, I take cognisance that MHA will be reviewing the screening of potential educators and even trainers and coaches of young children. But in light of the recent spate of cases of sex fiends against young persons, would MOE be looking at licensing tuition teachers, whether in a private setting and second, coaches and instructors that deliver services to students?",1,11,014-001-095-067-009-011,255

But we will be working with MHA, as I have mentioned earlier. MHA is currently reviewing it and the relevant Ministries are looking into how this screening framework for those working with children can be strengthened, including whether to make it mandatory for freelance providers of services for children to be screened for serious offences. Some of the considerations include balancing between protecting the vulnerable while providing people with second chances.

Any system for matching vacancies to children involves optimising three elements  vacancies, parents' choice and the time taken to arrive at a match. For instance, giving every parent their preferred choice while also achieving short waiting times would necessitate maintaining a large number of vacancies at all times. Costs will rise for childcare operators, which will find their way into higher fees for parents. The current system aims to strike a balance – to have a reasonable number of vacancies available while trying to meet parents' preference. The waiting time is then an outcome of trying to optimise these two variables.",1,3,014-001-095-067-010-003,260

Preschool capacity remains tight in certain areas, especially for the younger infant and playgroup ages. The Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) is working closely with anchor operators to ramp up operations and recruit manpower so that they can enroll more infants and children in newly-opened centres in the coming months. Where possible, ECDA also supports operators to increase capacity by building extension blocks to existing centres, though this is contingent on space availability in the immediate vicinity of the preschool, as well as finding adequate manpower to staff the new capacity.",2,4,014-001-095-067-010-004,261

ECDA analyses the demographics, enrolment trends and existing supply in each planning area and plans for preschool places to meet projected demand. ECDA works closely with agencies, such as HDB and URA, to inject preschools together with new housing developments where families with young children are concentrated. Specifically, for HDB developments, preschools are developed in tandem with new public housing flats so that residents can access preschool services soon after they move in. If additional capacity is necessary, ECDA works with preschools and HDB to activate available void deck and communal spaces for centre extensions. Maternity appointments could be useful as a leading indicator of upcoming demand.

I appreciate the Minister of State's responses and clarifications. Pertaining to the point about increased costs in order to maintain a pool of vacancies in order that we can optimise matching parents choices, what I see in my Meet-the-People sessions where a lot of residents are coming to me are challenges like the very real challenges, where distance actually matters greatly. The 15 minutes or 20 minutes of travelling time that they can save every morning goes a great way to alleviate their stress and mental health and mental well-being. So, when they are juggling between looking after old people, and then kids, and then multiple kids for some families, bring them to different locations to preschools and infant care and so on, it really simply does not make sense.",1,9,014-001-095-067-010-009,266

But we will not restrict the ONE Pass holder from working with other companies if he is able to transfer skillsets and his expertise. For instance, he could primarily be engaged by one company at a salary of $30,000, but because of his skillsets in corporate governance, he could be invited to become a director on the board of another company, potentially an SME, and provide that benefit.

Earlier on, I have shared that about 70% of the responses to the FCF advertisement happens within the first two weeks. After that, it then straddles along. At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, that was in October 2020, when we tightened the advertising period to 28 days. We were having – our job vacancies versus the job openings was about 0.5, meaning that that there were fewer job vacancies for a lot of jobseekers. Today, it has gone up almost fivefold, it is 2.4 as of end of March, now it is in excess of 2.4. And many companies have given feedback that they are really finding it very difficult to hire and if they wait for the period of time, for the 28-day advertising duration, they will lose the particular person that they want to hire and it compromises the operations of the business.",1,177,014-001-095-067-011-177,449

In my speech, I have also said about giving them time to ramp up and a runway to develop and we want to encourage this group of talent to take risks, calculated risk, of course, to make sure that the payoff is significant, so that our entire economy and ecosystem benefit. Having said that, because it is a wide diaspora of talent that we are looking at and in different sectors, we will work very closely with the sector agencies to evaluate ONE Pass holders on a very regular basis.

To the extent that this Bill is aimed at cracking cases and bringing criminals to justice, the Workers' Party supports the Bill.

However, non-intimate samples, which includes hair and swabs that would allow the collection of DNA, can be taken in the UK without consent if the person is under investigation for what is called a recordable offence.

Data released under Japanese information disclosure laws in late 2019 showed that those alleged to have committed serious crimes, such as murder, burglary and rape, accounted for only 4.8% of the DNA database. By contrast, DNA was collected for 210,000 persons suspected of violating the Road Traffic Law, the Swords and Firearm Law, the Immigration Control Law and the Minor Offence Law.

To that end, Sir, I seek four specific clarifications on the Bill. I will list them and then elaborate on each of them.",6,54,014-001-095-067-017-054,555
2022-09-12,Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-017,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"First, could the Minister elaborate how the secrecy of the DNA database will be ensured? Second, the proposed section 32(h) allows any information in the DNA database to be used for such purposes as may be prescribed. Could the Minister clarify whether the Government intends or foresees the use of DNA information for purposes other than for Police investigations into specific cases. And if not, will the Government undertake to return to this House to seek Parliamentary approval if the DNA database is to be used for non-investigation related purposes?",7,55,014-001-095-067-017-055,556

2022-09-12,Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-017,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Let me elaborate. First, the security of the DNA database. Sir, at its core, the surrender of personal DNA is significant. DNA data is not akin to non-DNA identifying information like fingerprints. For example, it is possible to use DNA information to create a profile of an individual by comparing their DNA data to a larger DNA sample size. This cannot be achieved with an existing register of fingerprints. Our DNA can tell a story or highlight predispositions that most people would not know about themselves.",9,57,014-001-095-067-017-057,558

2022-09-12,Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-017,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Seen in this context, the Bill envisages the surrender of private information for which the highest levels of security and access must be assured by the Government.

2022-09-12,Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-017,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),Can the Minister clarify what is the thinking behind not mandating the taking of DNA information but instead giving an option to the authorised officer?

Currently, the Act requires the Registrar of Criminals to destroy the photograph and finger impression of a person acquitted or discharged within three months from the date of acquittal or discharge. Similarly, clause 5 requires the Registrar to remove the DNA information of a person from the DNA database within three months of his acquittal or discharge.

2022-09-12,Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-017,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, on volunteers giving their DNA samples. Under the current section 13D of the Registration of Criminals Act, a person may volunteer to give a body sample if he was present at the scene of the crime or if he is being questioned in connection with the investigation. In this Bill, the proposed section 23 will expand the potential net of volunteers by enabling any volunteer to provide his sample even if there is no nexus between the volunteer and crime.",21,123,014-001-095-067-017-123,624
2022-09-12,Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-017,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, I note that such a provision does exist in other jurisdictions. So, in principle, I do not object to the change. However, the question is  how will this operate in practice and, in particular, whether the vulnerable groups may be pressured to provide blood samples thinking that they have no choice but to ""volunteer""? Already, with the current section 13D, I had noted previously in this House the case in 2008 – 14 years ago – of blood samples being taken from 200 foreign workers in the aftermath of an attack on a student at Clementi Woods Park. When I filed the Parliamentary Question on this in 2008, the Ministry replied that the blood samples were drawn after the workers had voluntarily given their consent. I do not know how the consents were obtained from the 200 workers to draw the blood samples. However, one could well ask to what extent the workers were worried that non-cooperation would jeopardise their employment in Singapore.",22,124,014-001-095-067-017-124,625

2022-09-12,Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-017,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, my second concern is about the proposed section 27. This section makes it an offence to refuse to consent to give a body sample when one is liable to give it. Although refusal to consent is already an offence, the proposed section 27 creates a new offence if a parent or guardian of a child refuses to give consent for a body sample to be drawn from the child. Although it is right to seek the consent of the parent or guardian in the case of a child, is it appropriate to inflict punishment on a parent or guardian who does not give consent to an invasive procedure on his or her child? Are there other jurisdictions where parents are punished in this way?",24,126,014-001-095-067-017-126,627
2022-09-12,Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-017,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Sir, finally, I should end on a note of caution. While DNA profiling has certainly been a game changer for law enforcement, there are limitations. From what I understand, DNA profiles lifted from crime scenes are often incomplete and, hence, less helpful in identifying a particular suspect. Such partial profiles will also match with many people. There is also the risk of the DNA being contaminated at the crime scene or being brought there by secondary transfer, that is, a person who was not at the scene may have his DNA inadvertently or even deliberately brought there by someone else. It is a fact that there had been miscarriages of justice in other jurisdictions involving DNA evidence, such as wrongful convictions, due to mix-ups in the laboratories handling the DNA.",25,127,014-001-095-067-017-127,628

No one can quarrel with the Ministry’s aspiration to strengthen the crime investigation capabilities of the Police for the security of our nation.

Advancement in technology means higher risks of hacking and of information being compromised. It is not unimaginable that much more can be done with DNA data, such as creating fake profiles, digital identity stealing, cloning and the like. Personal data, when fallen into wrong hands, can lead to dire consequences. Given that so much more sensitive personal data is collected by the state, what are the additional safeguards to ensure that the database, especially of DNA information, is better protected? What is the accountability of the agency should such personal data be leaked or compromised, whether locally or internationally? How will potential volunteers who might come forward to offer their DNA information to the Police be better briefed so that they can better make informed decisions before volunteering?",5,134,014-001-095-067-017-134,635

Take, for instance, the Bill’s introduction of tighter procedures for the removal of personal data collected in the Criminal Records Office’s database. Today, the Police are required to immediately remove both DNA and non-DNA data from the database when an individual is acquitted, discharged or the offence is compounded. But with the amendments, such individuals will now have to apply to the Police to remove their data. If rejected, one will then have to appeal to a Reviewing Tribunal. But unless properly advised and assisted, the less-educated and less tech-savvy individuals may not know how to exercise this right to apply to remove their DNA information nor how to make an application even if they know.",9,138,014-001-095-067-017-138,639

2022-09-12,Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-017,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Firstly, clause 2(d) of the amendment Bill states that an eligible crime is “any offence that is, at the time of the commission of the offence, punishable by imprisonment, not a registrable crime and not compoundable under any written law”. As such, under section 9 and 18(1) of the amendment Bill, an authorised officer may collect the DNA and non-DNA information from the individual accused of an eligible crime. MHA has further listed that reckless or dangerous driving causing hurt is one of the eligible crimes under the amendment Bill. Under section 64 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 (RTA), the sentencing of reckless or dangerous driving causing hurt is considered based on the injury caused to the victims, depending on four levels  death, grievous hurt, hurt and minimal or no injury. Under RTA, the sentencing framework of (a) hurt and (b) minimal or no injury, does not carry a mandatory imprisonment sentence and the offence appears to be compoundable under section 135 of RTA . I would like to clarify if the accused or convicted individuals of reckless or dangerous driving causing hurt with injury of (a) hurt and (b) minimal or no injury, will be subject to having their DNA information registered in the Police database?",7,153,014-001-095-067-017-153,654
2022-09-12,Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-017,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"My concern is for individuals who are accused or convicted of driving without due care or reasonable consideration – which section 65 of RTA states as “any person who drives a motor vehicle on a road (a) without due care and attention; or (b) without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road”. From time to time, I have attended to residents who have been charged in Court under section 65 of RTA during my Meet-the-People Sessions. Most of them committed the offence unintentionally and were remorseful of their actions. Although I stand firm that they should be dealt with fairly under our laws, drivers who unintentionally cause hurt or minimal or no injury, in my view, should not be subject to having their DNA information collected as the degree of blameworthiness of their actions is lower. In other words, it is not a deliberate act of harm. I would like to clarify with MHA if drivers convicted under driving without due care or reasonable consideration will be subject to having their DNA information collected and stored.",8,154,014-001-095-067-017-154,655

However, in the amendment Bill, it did not explicitly state the requirements for special needs individuals, whom I consider as vulnerable even if they are above 16 years of age.

In relation to my point on special needs individuals, despite being accused individuals, I believe that they are to be considered vulnerable adults and may warrant special attention to their needs and emotions while they undergo the potentially traumatic experience of being an accused person. I would like to clarify how MHA will safeguard the safety of these special needs individuals and ensure that no excessive force would be used on them if body samples are to be collected.",10,156,014-001-095-067-017-156,657

It also laid out that the purpose on which the DNA database may be used for investigation into a death, identifying a dead individual or for identifying an individual to provide Police assistance. In November 2021, a laboratory that was processing DNA evidence from rape victims for the Oklahoma City Police Department (OKCPD) in the United States was involved in a data breach due to unauthorised third-party access to their network, resulting in the exposure of personal data of an unknown number of victims of sexual assault.

Thus, I would like to ask if MHA can outline some of the legislative safeguards, such as whether the data will be stored in an on-premises secured database at a secured location or a secured cloud database. Also, how will the access of the database be controlled, that is, who are the people that MHA has identified to access the database based on their needs for investigation? Thirdly, will there be a data breach response plan in the unfortunate event that the DNA database experiences a data breach?",12,158,014-001-095-067-017-158,659

Although the Police have a high solving rate for murder cases through DNA information, according to Lianhe Zaobao, between 2017 and 2021, about 60% of the DNA samples collected by the Police at the crime scene did not match the existing database. Hence, I believe that by including those who have committed eligible non-registrable crimes in the scope of data collection through the Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill, the database will be expanded to provide a more effective tool for the Police to solve crimes. Therefore, I strongly support the Bill.",14,160,014-001-095-067-017-160,661
2022-09-12,Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-017,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"However, I hope that MHA will clarify that when collecting invasive samples of juvenile offenders under the age of 16, the written consent of the person, parent or guardian will be sought based on the needs of different age groups. I would like to know if MHA has the same provision to protect persons with special needs or intellectual disabilities who may have committed registrable crimes and eligible non-registrable crimes. I feel that people with special needs and the intellectually disabled, even if they are over the age of 16, are still vulnerable. Hence, there is a need to have provisions to give special attention to them, especially to their mental state, and to protect their rights and interests. Where necessary, provide appropriate assistance when collecting samples from them to help them, their parents, and guardians to understand the procedures and cooperate with the DNA officers.",15,161,014-001-095-067-017-161,662
2022-09-12,Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-017,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"(In English)  Mdm Deputy Speaker, back to English, please. Forensic medicine advancement has contributed to more effective criminal investigations. To our investigators and forensic pathologists, the pieces of evidence that they collect, including DNA data in a secured database, can lend a voice to the victims who suffer the brutality of the crimes committed against them. For the family and friends of the victims in murder cases, it offers the opportunity to bring closure to the death of their loved ones. Being a nine-year-old schoolmate of the first murdered child in the Toa Payoh ritual murders, I can speak personally of the trauma I felt when I heard the tragedy about 40 years ago and the closure I had when the murderers were finally brought to justice.",16,162,014-001-095-067-017-162,663

2022-09-12,Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-017,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"  This Bill will expand the collection and use of identifying information and DNA information. Such information helps law enforcement agencies to do their work more effectively. Because such information is sensitive, I support provisions in the Bill that protect such information when it is collected. I have four clarifications, all relating to the safeguards for the collection and removal of this information.",1,183,014-001-095-067-017-183,684
2022-09-12,Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-017,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My first clarification has to do with the forcible taking of samples. Under the new section 25, if an individual refuses to give a body sample that is not an invasive sample, a DNA officer may use force to take that body sample. I think we can all agree that having a body sample forcibly taken from us can be intrusive, distressing and traumatic. Can the Minister share how will DNA officers be trained to decide whether they should use force to take a body sample? What factors will DNA officers be asked to consider? Will there be checks and penalties to ensure that such acts of force, once done, are warranted and justified?",2,184,014-001-095-067-017-184,685
2022-09-12,Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-017,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My second clarification is on the taking of samples from those below 16 years of age. We should exercise extreme caution when taking samples from such young people. It is well-established that children and younger teenagers lack the ability to understand the full implications of their bodily consent. They do not know what they are really saying yes to, and there is good reason that the consent of parents and guardians is routinely required in such decisions.",3,185,014-001-095-067-017-185,686
2022-09-12,Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-017,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"However, this Bill allows DNA officers to, essentially, ignore the parents and guardians' preferences under certain conditions. Two are noteworthy. The first condition is that the consent of the parent or guardian is refused without good cause or cannot be obtained despite reasonable efforts. Can the Minister of State provide examples of what would constitute good cause and reasonable efforts? The second condition is that the underage person is ""willing"" to give the sample. Can the Minister of State clarify how DNA officers will ensure this ""willingness"" is an informed, meaningful one? Will they simply accept a vocal ""yes""? The reality is that the child or young teenager in this situation may feel pressured by the Police or other powerful adults bearing down on them. What rules and checks will be in place to ensure DNA officers, Police officers and other officers do not create undue pressure on these young minds to consent?",4,186,014-001-095-067-017-186,687
2022-09-12,Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-017,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My third clarification is on the removal of recorded information. With the amendments, the default position is that the data will be retained for individuals who have been acquitted, granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal or had their offence compounded. The onus is on them to apply to remove their data. Otherwise, it will stay in the system. Can the Minister of State share how these individuals will be informed of the option to apply for their data to be removed? What steps will be taken to ensure that the application process is transparent and reasonably easy to access?",5,187,014-001-095-067-017-187,688
2022-09-12,Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-017,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Relatedly, it seems that an individual granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal may not apply for their information to be removed. Can the Minister of State clarify if this is, in fact, the position? Given that a discharge not amounting to an acquittal is significantly different in nature from a conviction, can the Minister of State share if discretion may be exercised to allow the removal of information if there is a discharge not amounting to an acquittal?",6,188,014-001-095-067-017-188,689
2022-09-12,Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-017,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),Can the Minister of State also clarify whether an individual who has been given a stern warning will have their data information immediately removed after the end of investigations or will be entitled to apply for such removal?,7,189,014-001-095-067-017-189,690
2022-09-12,Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-017,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My last clarification has to do with the application process to remove information. Section 39 makes clear that certain individuals will be rejected if they apply to remove their information. This is because their information is considered sensitive, it is relevant to another ongoing prosecution or investigation, or there are other national security concerns. My question is this  will these individuals be told when their information is no longer considered sensitive? If not, how will they know whether they should apply again or not?",8,190,014-001-095-067-017-190,691
2022-09-12,Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-017,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Just as important, how will prescribed timelines apply to such individuals? How can they be expected to follow the prescribed timelines for a removal application when their information may be sensitive for a long time and then become non-sensitive without their knowledge?",9,191,014-001-095-067-017-191,692
2022-09-12,Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-017,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"In my view, the default action should be to remove someone's information without a fresh application if the individual was earlier rejected due to a section 39 reason and the reason no longer holds. After all, the individual had already demonstrated their preference for the removal. We should not require someone to apply again. If these individuals will be required to reapply, will they be informed of the opportunity to make a fresh application?

2022-09-12,Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-017,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"A key amendment is to allow Police officers to instruct a suspect to provide blood samples to collect DNA, without the need for a Magistrate's order. While this will boost timeliness of collection, as a safeguard, can the Minister of State share if this process will be authorised and supervised by an officer who is appropriately trained and qualified? Greater assurance could, for example, be achieved by requiring officers of a minimum rank, similar to the requirement stated in the Criminal Procedure Code.",3,196,014-001-095-067-017-196,697
2022-09-12,Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-017,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Regarding the retention of information, as the intent of this Bill is to collect more data to improve investigations, can the Minister of State clarify the rationale for the default expungement of suspects' information in cases of No Further Action under clause 35(3)? I ask this as the clause appears to be counter-intuitive since volunteers, who have a weaker connection to a case compared to suspects, are required to apply to the Police for removal of their data under clause 37(2). I note that clause 32 sets out the usage of DNA information for limited purposes. Notwithstanding, can the Minister of State explain what are ""other purposes"" under clause 32(h) that may be prescribed?",4,197,014-001-095-067-017-197,698
2022-09-12,Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-017,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"The Bill also proposes the sharing of DNA results of convicted criminals with foreign LEAs when assessed necessary. This expands the current regime where registrable information, such as fingerprints, are already shared. As a safeguard, the foreign LEA will need to provide an undertaking to safekeep the data, limit its uses and destroy it upon conclusion. Notwithstanding that these persons have been convicted, given that DNA information is more sensitive compared to fingerprints, can the Minister of State clarify if criteria to assess necessity for sharing will be made more stringent than currently?",5,198,014-001-095-067-017-198,699

Per clause 2(d) of the Bill, these are defined as any offence punishable with imprisonment, except those compoundable. With the foreseeable increase in the size and sensitivity of data collected, retained and used, I am encouraged that the Bill will also legislate safeguards for the handling of information, such as having persons accessing the databases to be screened and authorised by the Police.

Mr Melvin Yong, Mr Patrick Tay and Mr Sharael Taha asked how body samples are extracted from individuals. Typically, the DNA officer will obtain body samples in the form of blood. I have explained that this is because blood samples are more likely to yield a high-quality DNA profile. The DNA officer will sterilise the individual's fingertip, prick it with a disposable lancet and collect the blood droplets. In situations where it is not feasible to collect a blood sample, the officer will do a buccal swab by using a sterile swab to swab the inside of the individual's cheeks on both sides. However, the chances of obtaining a high-quality DNA profile from buccal swabs are lower.",3,272,014-001-095-067-017-272,773

A guilty criminal may not consent to provide data for fear of being incriminated and time is often of the essence when solving a crime. We must thus empower our Police officers to use reasonable force to obtain non-invasive samples, such as buccal swabs, in order to solve crimes.

So, when we find out later that he is not involved in the crime, it would only be right that we remove his DNA information which we had acquired coercively.

These individuals will not be allowed to apply for their information to be removed. An individual granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal has not been granted a full acquittal on the charge and the Public Prosecutor may still institute proceedings against the accused on the charge. This may occur, for example, where an accused has absconded. Thus, his information should not be removed from the database as it is still required for investigations or prosecution.

This provision allows the Ministry to prescribe additional uses of DNA information via subsidiary legislation. Such subsidiary legislation has to be published in the Gazette and presented to Parliament.,49,318,014-001-095-067-017-318,819
2022-09-12,Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-017,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Singh's third question is on how officers may decide whether to take DNA. Officers on the ground will have to be given the discretion, exercise their judgement whether to take the DNA for the investigations. It is not possible to prescribe precisely when they should and should not take DNA in future, because there are thousands of different situations. What the law can do is to set out the parameters, the framework for the exercise of the powers and that is what we are doing. Police will assess the nature of the crime, the evidence and whether to collect DNA information even if the offence is registrable or eligible.",50,319,014-001-095-067-017-319,820

2022-09-12,Singapore Tourism Board (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-019,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My first point is on the new section 8HA. The section introduces a new power for STB to act as a third-party guarantor for the tourism enterprises. This is subject to the Minister’s approval and provided that the enterprise develops Singapore as a destination or enhances the travel and tourism sector’s contribution to the economy.,3,31,014-001-095-067-019-031,880
2022-09-12,Singapore Tourism Board (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-019,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"This new power comes with significant risks. STB may end up propping up mismanaged, decaying businesses. STB may also be accused of picking and choosing winners in the tourism industry, unfairly disadvantaging those not lucky enough to be chosen. This power should thus be used in extremely limited situations. The decision to use it must be guided by clear, objective frameworks of success.",4,32,014-001-095-067-019-032,881
2022-09-12,Singapore Tourism Board (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-019,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),How will the Minister decide whether to approve instances where STB seek to use this power? What factors will they consider? In what situations is STB envisioned to use this power?,5,33,014-001-095-067-019-033,882
2022-09-12,Singapore Tourism Board (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-019,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My second point is about how public interest will be determined under the amended Act. A number of amendments proposed refer to the STB or Controller making decisions on the basis of “public interest”.,6,34,014-001-095-067-019-034,883

2022-09-12,Singapore Tourism Board (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-067-019,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My third point is on how STB will assist the cruise line industry in reaching its sustainability goals.

MPA has also said it aims to decarbonise the maritime industry. What steps will STB take to help decarbonise the cruise line industry?

For example, a comprehensive risk assessment will be conducted to measure factors such as  (a) the risk to the Government; (b) the track record of the tourism enterprise, (c) potential cost and time savings; and (d) economic benefits. STB will also need to seek the approvals of its Board of Directors as well as the Minister for Trade and Industry.

More support must be given to teachers by school leaders, MOE and we ourselves as parents. Students must be made aware and reminded continuously that any misbehaviours, rudeness, aggressiveness, or worse, threats, will never be condoned and they must face equal-like consequences. The school leadership must support the teachers in disciplining students and stand firm when communicating with parents on disciplinary matters. While approaches to disciplining matters may differ, teachers must feel that these approaches are effective with the strong backing of school leadership. We must ensure that the dignity of teachers is maintained and that the restorative practices are also implemented to resolve conflict, repair harm and heal relationships. This is also to maintain and uphold the students' dignity and well-being.",13,15,014-001-095-067-021-015,929

Our teachers have their personal lives and family to attend to. We, as parents, need to understand that teachers need their work-life balance as much as us.

As teaching becomes increasingly complex and there are competing demands on teachers' time, more could be done for this final area. Teachers need more time outside of classroom teaching to attend to marking, preparing for lessons and working on student guidance. To then load them with committee work, non-teaching-related duties and meetings as well as constant, non-stop WhatsApp messages from multiple chat groups is unwise and untenable. The expectations must be calibrated vis-a-vis ranking and appraisal as well as reducing non-teaching-related workload ought to be reviewed.

Throughout my experience as a student in a neighbourhood school, fights and similar incidents are common among students, be it within my school or in other schools. But we could never have imagined an era where students disrespect their teachers. This is totally unacceptable, and as parents, we should be ashamed if our children behave that way. Parents must be firm in educating our children so that they respect their teachers, instead of doing the opposite.

They are typically sentenced by the military courts to a minimum of eight to nine months detention in the SAF Detention Barracks.

Their purchase of combination and speed ovens helped its kitchen speed up cooking processes and alleviate its manpower crunch. With improved processes, the company is now in a better position to expand its operations in Singapore and internationally.

Generally, older students who had continued training since October 2021 were able to demonstrate comparable competition standards. As CCA training for primary level resumed only in January 2022, it is understandable that we had observed a slight drop in competition standards among younger athletes for some sports.

This could be due to unforeseen circumstances, such as changes in their family situation back home, or unanticipated challenges in adjusting to the new work environment in Singapore. Such a decision would not have been taken lightly as the work permit holders would have incurred financial costs and made sacrifices to leave their home country to work in Singapore. In situations where the work permit holders request to end their employment early, employers can approach their employment agencies for assistance to facilitate open communication with their workers to understand the concerns, and discuss options to resolve the issues amicably.",2,3,014-001-095-067-072-003,1231

2022-09-12,Unintended Consequences from Legislating Right to Work from Home,014-001-095-067-073,Dr Tan See Leng,  Flexible Work Arrangements are increasingly important in the workplace today. More employees see Flexible Work Arrangements as an important criterion in job selection. Employers are also recognising the importance of Flexible Work Arrangements in the competition for talent amidst a tight labour market.

However, there is no one-size-fits-all solution in providing Flexible Work Arrangements as business needs differ across industries and roles. For instance, work-from-home is not practicable for certain roles, such as frontline work. Introducing legislation as suggested by the Member will introduce rigidities and this means that employers will not be able to decide which working arrangements best meet the needs of the business and other co-workers.  Insisting that all companies here must allow work-from-home is not pragmatic given the differences across industries and firms and could end up stifling the growth and dynamism of our economy and economic opportunities for Singaporeans in the longer term.",2,3,014-001-095-067-073-003,1235

2022-09-12,Unintended Consequences from Legislating Right to Work from Home,014-001-095-067-073,Dr Tan See Leng,"Countries such as UK, Australia and Netherlands, have legislated the right-to-request for Flexible Work Arrangements, including work-from-home, but not the definite right to Flexible Work Arrangements or work-from-home. This means that while employers must abide by certain processes when assessing requests for Flexible Work Arrangements, they have the prerogative to decide whether they can accede to the request.",4,5,014-001-095-067-073-005,1237
2022-09-12,Unintended Consequences from Legislating Right to Work from Home,014-001-095-067-073,Dr Tan See Leng,"MOM has studied this carefully. There is indeed merit in strengthening the processes for employers to assess employees’ request for Flexible Work Arrangements, but we should do so without creating a litigious workplace culture where everything is governed by law. Mutual trust is important for Flexible Work Arrangements to work, and we should provide the space for employers and workers to discuss and find an approach that works for both parties.",5,6,014-001-095-067-073-006,1238

As earlier announced this year, Tripartite Partners will introduce a new set of Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangements by 2024.

First, names of stillborn children, like in abortions, are not required for the Government to administer public policies and programmes. Second, it allows the registration process to be fully automated without parents having to take any action. This is to alleviate any administrative burden while they may still be grieving. These improvements to the registration process for the public, and associated changes in ICA's systems, were implemented in May this year, following the recent amendments to the Registration of Births and Deaths Act.",1,2,014-001-095-067-088-002,1319

But we cannot compete on the basis of financial incentives alone. Our strong fundamentals, including our stability, robust intellectual property protection regime, and skilled workforce, have allowed us to develop and grow the semiconductor sector over the decades. To support the growth in the sector, the Government has continued to partner key companies across the value chain, many of whom are global leaders in the sector, to invest in leading edge manufacturing capacities and workforce training in Singapore. Recent investments by Globalfoundries, UMC, Siltronics, and Pall Corporation are testament to the strong partnership that we have built with the industry leaders. We also work with partner manufacturers to conduct complementary activities in Singapore, including in R&D and supply chain management, to diversify their base of activities and deepen their operations here. In addition, we are also working with them to address their longer-term challenges, including to achieve their sustainability ambitions.

2022-09-12,Regulations on Hoarding as Fire Hazard in Residential Estates,014-001-095-067-123,Mr Desmond Lee,"  Compulsive hoarding is characterised by the excessive acquisition of items that are of little or no value, and an inability or unwillingness to discard them. While hoarders' homes may be filled from floor to ceiling with what most may deem as ""rubbish"", they view these items as important and cannot bear to part with them. In the most severe cases, the hoarder may even rough sleep outside their homes as there is hardly any space left inside. Internationally, the Clutter Image Rating Scale (CIRS) is used to measure the extent and severity of hoarding.",1,2,014-001-095-067-123-002,1474
2022-09-12,Regulations on Hoarding as Fire Hazard in Residential Estates,014-001-095-067-123,Mr Desmond Lee,"The root cause of a hoarder's behaviour is complex. For example, one's hoarding could be a symptom of underlying mental health conditions like Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), or developed after trauma or deep grief. Hoarding behaviours could also be exacerbated by social factors, such as disputes with one's family or the stockpiling of collected items at home for one's ""karang guni"" business. Hoarding strikes people of all ages. While hoarding is more often observed in the elderly, it is a behavioural trait that could have slowly deteriorated throughout adulthood and worsened as one ages.",2,3,014-001-095-067-123-003,1475

A hoarded home may be infested with pests from rotting food or pose a fire risk as occupants may be unable to escape in an emergency due to blockages to exit routes from the extreme accumulation of clutter. Hoarding that clutters corridors also obstructs evacuation routes for neighbours in times of fire. The emanating stench may also inconvenience neighbours and be a nuisance by preventing them from enjoying living in their own homes.

Where risks are identified to the extent that established rules and laws are violated, regulatory agencies will issue orders or take enforcement action on the hoarder or homeowner. For example, NEA may order the owner to remove items contributing to pest infestations in their home, while SCDF may order the owner to cease hoarding flammable items such as fuel. AVS will also act against hoarding of animals within a HDB flat where animal welfare is harmed, or Town Councils may require owners to remove hoarding in the common areas.",5,6,014-001-095-067-123-006,1478

Other schemes such as the Enterprise Development Grant and the Productivity Solutions Grant, are also available to help businesses strengthen their capabilities. The Economic Development Board also works to attract investments in a wide range of sectors.

The Government and tripartite partners will continue to uplift our lower-wage workers through the Progressive Wage Model. Nevertheless, we recognise that the impact of inflation hits lower-wage workers harder. To help lower-income households and vulnerable groups with inflation and cost of living concerns, the Government has announced several support measures, including the $1.5 billion Support Package announced in June 2022.
