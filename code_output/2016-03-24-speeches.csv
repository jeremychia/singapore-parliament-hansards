2016-03-24,Number of Single Parents who Have Successfully Applied for HDB Flats under ASSIST,013-001-094-010-004,The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Koh Poh Koon),"Eighty-five applicants under ASSIST had approached HDB for financial assistance to purchase their flats. HDB helped over half of these applicants. Most needed help with paying the resale levy. HDB assesses the circumstances of each case and provides assistance wherever possible â€“ for example, by incorporating the resale levy into the purchase price of the BTO flat, so that the payments can be spread over a longer period of time. Of the remaining applicants, some wanted to buy a flat beyond their means. In such circumstances, HDB will advise them to buy a flat within their budget instead, while others were advised to defer the flat purchase until they were financially ready.",2,3,013-001-094-010-004-003,28

2016-03-24,Number of Long-Term Visit Pass Plus Granted after Introduction of Scheme,013-001-094-010-006,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Amrin Amin),There is no separate application process for LTVP+. Singaporeans can apply for LTVP or LTVP+ for their foreign spouses through the same process. Foreign spouses who meet the criteria will be granted the LTVP+. Those who do not meet the LTVP+ criteria but meet the LTVP criteria would be granted LTVP.,3,4,013-001-094-010-006-004,45

That is the first matter. The second is should they encounter rejections from employers who say that they cannot employ them, even with a Letter of Consent, notwithstanding other possible reasons, what should they do?",1,8,013-001-094-010-006-008,49
2016-03-24,Number of Long-Term Visit Pass Plus Granted after Introduction of Scheme,013-001-094-010-006,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Because one of the feedback has been that employers still consider them as foreign workers and say that it is really troublesome to hire them. That is not very helpful when they are also trying to work to supplement household income, and working towards gaining PR status so that their citizen families â€“ generally, majority are citizen families â€“ can stay intact and remain stable in Singapore.",2,9,013-001-094-010-006-009,50

I would like to put forward the question regarding the application process for the LTVP and LTVP+. Would applicants, for example, who have Singaporean children â€“ one or two children, or even more â€“ are they regarded any differently in terms of the application process? Is the process, perhaps, expedited for such situations?",1,11,013-001-094-010-006-011,52

Could the Parliamentary Secretary shed some light on this, please?",2,12,013-001-094-010-006-012,53
2016-03-24,Number of Long-Term Visit Pass Plus Granted after Introduction of Scheme,013-001-094-010-006,Mr Amrin Amin, I thank the Member for the question. Applications for LTVP+ are considered holistically based on a range of factors. This includes the duration of the marriage and whether the couple have children from the marriage and the ability of the Singaporean sponsor to support the family.,1,13,013-001-094-010-006-013,54
2016-03-24,Number of Long-Term Visit Pass Plus Granted after Introduction of Scheme,013-001-094-010-006,Mr Amrin Amin,"So, it is a range of factors. It is difficult to give the Member assurance that once you have children, that you will automatically get LTVP.

2016-03-24,Number of Long-Term Visit Pass Plus Granted after Introduction of Scheme,013-001-094-010-006,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"  Just a supplementary question for the Parliamentary Secretary. I understand that one of the criteria for granting a LTVP+ is whether the marriage is stable. I think that is a sound criterion. I would like to ask whether we can be more transparent and more definitive in terms of what is considered ""stable marriage"". Is it three years, is it two years? If that could be spelt out, it would provide a lot of certainty to the entire family.",1,17,013-001-094-010-006-017,58
2016-03-24,Number of Long-Term Visit Pass Plus Granted after Introduction of Scheme,013-001-094-010-006,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"My other suggestion for the Parliamentary Secretary to consider is, if there is such a criterion, whether attempts could be made for those so that for who have met that criterion are automatically upgraded from LTVP to LTVP+, without the need to apply. So, I hope to get your clarification.",2,18,013-001-094-010-006-018,59
2016-03-24,Number of Long-Term Visit Pass Plus Granted after Introduction of Scheme,013-001-094-010-006,Mr Amrin Amin,"  I thank the Member for the question. There are no plans at this stage to define what a stable marriage is. It is not a very easy thing to define how stable the marriage is. One of the factors we look at is the length of years of the marriage. But there are also various factors including the record of the applicant who is applying, in terms of how many times he or she had been married. It is not easy to put out a set of criteria and say ""These are the criteria and this is it"". But the suggestion is taken; the need for transparency is something we will take very seriously.",1,19,013-001-094-010-006-019,60

It is considered in the same way. When you apply for LTVP, as I mentioned during my reply just now, that is the same process for LTVP and LTVP+.

The SAF will endeavour to do its utmost to train safely, but realistically speaking, all of us recognise that in military organisations, injuries and deaths can happen despite best efforts. Each time an injury or death occurs, we must ensure that independent and impartial investigative processes are instituted to determine the key facts, arrive at appropriate conclusions, take the corrective measures to ensure that mistakes, if any, are not repeated.

He was tried in Court and the Court fined him $3,000 â€“ no detention. The Company Sergeant Major involved in that accident was not prosecuted by the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC).

It is then up to the criminal courts to determine the level of culpability and commensurate punishments. The SAF fully accepts these judicial processes and indeed deems them necessary so that our SAF servicemen are held accountable for their actions.

It ""could not be definitive whether in the deceased's case the reaction was due to the inhalation of excessive fumes or the mere inhalation of fumes"" (para 77 of the Coroner's findings). In his findings, the Coroner also opined that it was clear that the deceased's allergic reaction was ""unlikely to have been predicted"" (para 66 of the Coroner's findings). Because of these findings and conclusions, AGC decided not to prosecute anyone as the cause of death was an unforeseen allergic reaction that was unlikely to have been predicted. AGC informed MINDEF to consider taking disciplinary action against the servicemen who had breached Training Safety Regulations (TSR).

Allergy to zinc chloride from smoke grenades is known but rare, which is why till today, many militaries still use this type of smoke grenade, including the US military and the Republic of Korea. In the SAF's own history, we have been using this type of smoke grenades. I think Members of the House here who had done NS would have tested it.

After the safety review following this case, the SAF switched to alternatives which do not release zinc chloride fumes. We did that in March 2014. While the SAF has decided to do so, let me point out that there is no safety requirement internationally that precludes the use of such smoke grenades. Indeed, other militaries, as I have said, continue to use it and this underscores the fact that allergy to zinc chloride is rare so that the militaries have chosen to continue their use and accept that risk.",13,14,013-001-094-010-010-014,110

If our military officer or military servicemen who now make patrols in Changi Airport and Jurong Island, and if they see a significant threat, and they are tasked to protect that place or island, do they discharge the firearm?

Each had put less than $70,000 into their CPF accounts by the age of 55, perhaps because they were in low-wage jobs throughout their working lives. By all three counts, the couple qualify for Silver Support. The couple would receive $600 each in Silver Support payouts every three months, or $4,800 together over the whole year. This will not change or stop any other support they are receiving â€“ such as the GST Voucher or healthcare subsidies through CHAS.

2016-03-24,Lift Upgrading Programme for Previously Ineligible Flats,013-001-094-010-022,Mr Zainal Sapari,asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether HDB can reconsider to (i) offer the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) to ineligible flats due to cost considerations (ii) offer LUP again to those blocks of flats that have not been successful if there are changes to the owners of the benefiting units; and (b) whether HDB will withdraw the right of the owners of the benefiting units to ballot if their units have been rented out or they could not be contacted for whatever reasons.,1,1,013-001-094-010-022-001,548
2016-03-24,Lift Upgrading Programme for Previously Ineligible Flats,013-001-094-010-022,Mr Lawrence Wong,"  When the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) was introduced in 2001, there were more than 5,300 blocks that did not have direct lift access. Almost 1,000 blocks exceeded the LUP cost cap then. However, over time, HDB developed various cost-effective technical solutions so that more blocks could benefit from LUP. These efforts have reduced the number of ineligible blocks to around 150.",1,2,013-001-094-010-022-002,549
2016-03-24,Lift Upgrading Programme for Previously Ineligible Flats,013-001-094-010-022,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Despite HDBâ€™s best efforts, there will still be some blocks where the LUP cannot be offered due to excessively high costs or technical constraints. By necessity, we have to set a financial cap on how much we can build and spend on each benefiting unit. This is so that we spend prudently.",2,3,013-001-094-010-022-003,550
2016-03-24,Lift Upgrading Programme for Previously Ineligible Flats,013-001-094-010-022,Mr Lawrence Wong,"For blocks that have failed the LUP polling previously, HDB will evaluate appeals on a case-by-case basis. Key considerations are whether the circumstances have changed since the last polling, and if there is at least 75% support from residents before appealing for LUP to be re-offered. This is regardless of whether there has been any change in owners of the benefiting units.",3,4,013-001-094-010-022-004,551

2016-03-24,CPF Special or Retirement Account Funds for Mortgage Arrears,013-001-094-010-023,Mr Lim Swee Say,"  CPF members can use their Ordinary Account (OA) savings for the downpayment, monthly instalments and mortgage arrears for their housing purchase. The Special Account (SA) savings are generally preserved for membersâ€™ retirement needs, and cannot be used for housing purposes.",1,2,013-001-094-010-023-002,554
2016-03-24,CPF Special or Retirement Account Funds for Mortgage Arrears,013-001-094-010-023,Mr Lim Swee Say,"When members turn 55, a Retirement Account, or RA, is created. Monies from the OA and the SA are transferred to the RA up to the Full Retirement Sum. The OA continues to exist even after the RA is created. Any remaining OA balance, as well as new contributions to the OA after the age of 55, can be used to meet housing needs. In addition, any RA savings in excess of the Basic Retirement Sum can also be used for housing purposes.",2,3,013-001-094-010-023-003,555

For flat owners who can no longer afford to keep their flats, HDB will help them explore more options, including right-sizing to a more affordable flat.",3,4,013-001-094-010-023-004,556

2016-03-24,CPF Special or Retirement Account Funds for Mortgage Arrears,013-001-094-010-023,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Overall, we need to strike a balance between allowing CPF members to use their SA and RA savings for housing needs and safeguarding such savings for their retirement needs, so as not to compromise their retirement adequacy.",5,6,013-001-094-010-023-006,558

2016-03-24,Labour Crunch in Maritime Industry,013-001-094-010-024,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Overall, while manpower is tight, for certain jobs that are physically taxing or require sea-going expertise, such as stevedores or harbourcraft crew, foreign workers complement the local workforce due to a shortage of Singaporeans willing to do the work. Nonetheless, most companies are well within their Dependency Ratio Ceiling (DRC) for the employment of foreign workers.",2,3,013-001-094-010-024-003,561
2016-03-24,Labour Crunch in Maritime Industry,013-001-094-010-024,Mr Lim Swee Say,"As part of developing the Sectorial Manpower Plan (SMP), the Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) is also working with industry partners and the unions to help more Singaporeans take up sea-faring as well as shore-based careers in the maritime sector. These efforts include putting in place programmes to train more Singaporean seafarers and developing career ladders for various professions in the sector.",3,4,013-001-094-010-024-004,562
2016-03-24,Labour Crunch in Maritime Industry,013-001-094-010-024,Mr Lim Swee Say,"MPA is also promoting the use of technologies and automation at our port to reduce reliance on manual labour. For instance, MPA is working with PSA to pilot the use of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs). As port operations expand, the use of AGVs will reduce the need for more foreign port workers.",4,5,013-001-094-010-024-005,563
2016-03-24,Labour Crunch in Maritime Industry,013-001-094-010-024,Mr Lim Swee Say,"With the implementation of productive technologies and efforts to address the manpower shortage for specific jobs at the port, we do not see a need to adjust the foreign worker quota for this industry at this point of time. We should instead press on with our efforts to drive productivity improvement and accelerate the shift towards a more manpower-lean mode of port operations.",5,6,013-001-094-010-024-006,564

2016-03-24,Separating Clients' Deposits and Payments to Prevent Unlawful Withdrawal of Funds,013-001-094-010-025,Mr S Iswaran,"  The Governmentâ€™s approach to consumer protection is based on promoting fair trading among retailers, and helping consumers make informed purchasing decisions. This approach has benefited consumers and businesses, as the vast majority of our retailers are legitimate businesses who want to serve their customers well.",1,2,013-001-094-010-025-002,566
2016-03-24,Separating Clients' Deposits and Payments to Prevent Unlawful Withdrawal of Funds,013-001-094-010-025,Mr S Iswaran,"As the nature of consumer transactions can vary widely in practice, broad-based requirements such as mandating that deposits be put into escrow accounts would be onerous, and raise the cost of doing business which will ultimately be passed on to consumers.",2,3,013-001-094-010-025-003,567
2016-03-24,Separating Clients' Deposits and Payments to Prevent Unlawful Withdrawal of Funds,013-001-094-010-025,Mr S Iswaran,"In sectors where deposits are the norm, the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) has worked with sector associations to develop the CaseTrust accreditation scheme. Most businesses accredited under the CaseTrust scheme provide protection for consumersâ€™ deposits. This usually takes the form of business insurance which will compensate consumers if the business becomes insolvent. Currently more than 700 businesses from various sectors offering motoring, renovation and spa and wellness services are CaseTrust accredited. CASE recently announced that it has partnered the Hair and Cosmetology Association (Singapore) to work on CaseTrust accreditation to promote fair trading, improve the sectorâ€™s image and raise consumer confidence. CASE is in similar discussions with the Association of Catering Professionals. We encourage more businesses to become accredited as this helps to provide consumers with greater confidence that their interests are safeguarded.",3,4,013-001-094-010-025-004,568
2016-03-24,Upgrading of Private Estates above 30 Years Old,013-001-094-010-026,Mr Chong Kee Hiong,asked the Minister for National Development how many private estates there are that are currently above 30 years old and whether there is a plan to upgrade these estates through the Estate Upgrading Programme by a certain due date.,1,1,013-001-094-010-026-001,569
2016-03-24,Upgrading of Private Estates above 30 Years Old,013-001-094-010-026,Mr Lawrence Wong,"  Since the Estate Upgrading Programme (EUP) was launched in 2000, MND has selected 63 private estates through nine batches of EUP, benefitting more than 46,000 households. There are about five to nine estates selected in each batch. In selecting estates for EUP, we consider the age of the estate as well as the physical conditions. We prioritise the older estates, which have greater need and more opportunities for significant improvement through the upgrading works. These works include installation of park furniture and playground equipment that provide a more conducive environment for community bonding, and footpath improvement to provide better connectivity and accessibility. With the nine batches of EUP, we are making good progress in upgrading the estates that are more than 30 years old.",1,2,013-001-094-010-026-002,570

There are slightly more than 20 estates, which are more than 30 years old and have yet to be selected for EUP. We will continue to prioritise these older estates for EUP. The pace of the programme will depend on the resources available. We will also coordinate with other government agencies that are also planning upgrading works, so as to minimise inconvenience to the public.",2,3,013-001-094-010-026-003,571

2016-03-24,Repairs and Maintenance Schedule for Nature Parks,013-001-094-010-027,Mr Lawrence Wong,"  NParks carries out quarterly checks of the amenities within nature parks, and repairs them if necessary.

2016-03-24,Difference between Parking Fees for Surface and Multi-storey Car Parks,013-001-094-010-028,Mr Lawrence Wong,"  Parking charges are levied to recover part of the cost of providing and maintaining HDB car parks. As it costs more to provide and maintain multi-storey car parks (MSCPs) compared to surface car parks, the monthly season parking rate is generally higher for MSCPs.",1,2,013-001-094-010-028-002,577
2016-03-24,Difference between Parking Fees for Surface and Multi-storey Car Parks,013-001-094-010-028,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Some precincts are served by both surface car parks and MSCPs. As the surface lots are generally nearer to the flats, they are understandably more popular. In some instances, this imbalance in demand has resulted in congestion in some surface car parks while the MSCPs are under-utilised. In these car-parks, one of HDBâ€™s measures to regulate and even out the parking demand is to equalise the monthly parking charges between the surface and MSCPs. However, HDB has no plans to implement island-wide equalisation of season parking charges as there is no widespread imbalance in parking demand today.",2,3,013-001-094-010-028-003,578

2016-03-24,Feedback from Public Consultation on Fresh Start Housing Scheme,013-001-094-010-029,Mr Lawrence Wong,"There was also broad agreement that the families benefiting from the Scheme must also do their part to get their lives and finances in order. This means that they must show the commitment to find a job and maintain a stable income. At the same time, there was a strong view that the Scheme should focus on the children, and ensure that they are attending school regularly, so that the next generation can make progress and secure a better future.",4,5,013-001-094-010-029-005,583

Based on the feedback received, we are now working out the detailed parameters for the Fresh Start Housing Scheme. What is clear is that the Scheme must be more than just the provision of another housing grant and a new flat. Itâ€™s about supporting the families in need and helping them to solve their problems holistically. We continue to welcome feedback and will announce more details about the scheme soon.",5,6,013-001-094-010-029-006,584

2016-03-24,Ensuring Quality of Works Done for Home Improvement Programme,013-001-094-010-030,Mr Lawrence Wong,"HDB adopts a multi-pronged approach to ensure the quality of HIP upgrading works. First, HDB has a stringent procurement process to engage capable and financially-sound contractors and consultants. Second, HDB maintains a list of recommended building materials suppliers for contractors to use in HIP projects. Third, HDB requires contractors to provide sample units before mass production. Once these sample units are approved, they serve as the quality benchmark. Fourth, HDB engages consultants with full-time staff on site to supervise upgrading works. Fifth, HDB institutes a robust quality audit and enforcement regime. Sixth, HDB has regular dialogue sessions with the contractorsâ€™ senior management to share the expected quality and workmanship standards and alert them of the quality issues that require their remedial action and pre-emptive measures. Seventh, HDB and consultants carry out functional tests to check on electrical services installed and the water-tightness of the upgraded toilets. Finally, HDB and consultants conduct a final inspection on completed upgrading works prior to the handover to residents.",2,3,013-001-094-010-030-003,587

Understandably, there will be some inconveniences when the works are in progress. HDB seeks to keep these to a minimum, and to complete work on the interior of each flat within 10 working days. When work is in progress, temporary common toilets/bathrooms are provided at the void deck. Portable toilets are also set up at the end of each working day in flats undergoing upgrading works, for residentsâ€™ use at night. In addition, an air-conditioned study room and rest area are provided for residentsâ€™ use.

The CDCs bring together various community stakeholders across the 3P (people, public and private) sectors to serve the residents in each District. This engenders community ownership and builds community resilience. For example, by partnering the Law Society, CDCs have provided residents with greater accessibility to legal advice, and better awareness of legal issues through legal talks by pro bono lawyers. By partnering the National Arts Council (NAC), the CDCs have made arts programmes more accessible to the vulnerable. By working with SPRING Singapore and the Business Associations to set up the five Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SME) Centres@CDCs, the CDCs have helped to promote greater awareness of the Governmentâ€™s help schemes for and offer business advice to SMEs.",2,3,013-001-094-010-031-003,592

For example at North East (NE) District, the NE CDC coordinates among Grassroots Organisations, Social Service Offices and Workforce Development Agency to help the residents achieve self-reliance from receiving financial assistance to getting employment.

2016-03-24,Property Pledges by CPF Members to Allow for Fund Withdrawal Beyond Basic Retirement Sum,013-001-094-010-038,Mr Lim Swee Say,  CPF members aged 55 and above can withdraw their Retirement Account savings above their Basic Retirement Sum if they have a sufficient existing charge on their property. Those who do not have a sufficient existing property charge can still make such a withdrawal after making a pledge on their property. This property charge or pledge does not affect the ownership of the property and is intended to ensure that the memberâ€™s Retirement Account is restored up to the Full Retirement Sum if the property is sold in the future.,1,2,013-001-094-010-038-002,614

2016-03-24,Productivity Growth of Government over 10 Years,013-001-094-010-039,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"  The Public Service is constantly seeking to be more productive, doing more with the same or less resources, and ensuring that we continue to be effective and efficient in delivering our services. However, unlike the private sector, it is difficult to measure productivity growth in public services, as the outcomes achieved and value created from the diverse range of public services are often intangible and not easily quantifiable.",1,2,013-001-094-010-039-002,618
2016-03-24,Productivity Growth of Government over 10 Years,013-001-094-010-039,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Nevertheless to give a sense of the numbers, our population and real GDP grew by 2.6% and 5.3% per annum on average over the past 10 years. During the same period, we have maintained our public sector manpower growth at an average of 1.8% per annum to serve the population and support the economy. The lower public sector headcount growth is a result of a deliberate policy to constrain Ministriesâ€™ headcount growth under the Manpower Management Framework. As a result, the public sectorâ€™s share of the total labour force has also decreased from 4.30% in 2006 to 3.97% in 2015. This is one of the lowest internationally; it is the same as that in Hong Kong (4%) and lower than in countries such as New Zealand (7%) and the UK (12%) -- in all these cases, the numbers exclude defence personnel.",2,3,013-001-094-010-039-003,619
2016-03-24,Productivity Growth of Government over 10 Years,013-001-094-010-039,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"To drive productivity and innovation in the Public Service, our agencies have been tapping on technology and ICT extensively. Compared to 10 years ago, there are now more e-services on multiple channels, which have made it more convenient and efficient for both the users as well as for the agencies. For example, through electronic tax-filing and the no-filing scheme, IRAS has saved time for taxpayers. It was also able to redeploy 100 officers to doing new and other areas of work, despite the tax base growth of 32% from 2009 to 2014. Another example would be ACRAâ€™s Bizfile which has enabled businesses to be registered and companies to be incorporated online in just 15 minutes or less, compared to the manual process which would have taken 24 hours for businesses and five days for companies.",3,4,013-001-094-010-039-004,620
2016-03-24,Productivity Growth of Government over 10 Years,013-001-094-010-039,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"We have also sought to drive productivity gains through organisational restructuring. For example, we setup the Municipal Services Office (MSO) in 2014 to improve the Governmentâ€™s overall coordination and delivery of municipal services; often, these services involve multiple agencies. Since its establishment, MSO has worked with these agencies to improve inter-agency work flows, processes and SOPs to reduce the average time taken to respond to feedback, especially for complex cases. MSO has also worked with agencies to improve the adoption of structured digital channels such as mobile apps and web portals. This has allowed feedback to be routed quickly and automatically to the correct agency for attention.",4,5,013-001-094-010-039-005,621
2016-03-24,Productivity Growth of Government over 10 Years,013-001-094-010-039,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Beyond tapping on IT and organisational restructuring, we have also started to harness data analytics to innovate and improve services. For example, the National Library Board analysed borrowing data to understand library users and their borrowing behavior. This has enabled the NLB to determine the type and number of books it should purchase, and improve its mix of book collections to make library services better.",5,6,013-001-094-010-039-006,622
