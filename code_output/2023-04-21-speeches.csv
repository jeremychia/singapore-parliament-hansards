2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Ms Mariam Jaafar –,2 To ask the Minister for Health (a) whether insurers offering massive additional coverage for cancer treatment through their riders is a cause for concern for the Ministry; and (b) whether such riders undermine efforts to contain cancer drug costs.,2,2,014-002-095-101-002-002,7
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Yip Hon Weng,"asked the Minister for Health (a) in the past year, what is the proportion of cancer patients who have exceeded the annual claim limits of $1,200 from MediShield Life and $600 from MediSave for their cancer treatment; (b) what assistance is available for such patients; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider creating a separate claim category for the coverage of elective cancer drug services to avoid exceeding the claim limits for essential cancer drug services.",1,3,014-002-095-101-002-003,8

2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Let me first provide some facts that have been requested. The annual number of Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents who received cancer drug treatment and services increased from 22,500 in 2017, to 31,500 in 2021, which is a 40% increase. Eighty-four percent received treatment in Public Healthcare Institutions, or PHIs, and 16% in private medical institutions. And this proportion has remained stable over the past few years.",2,9,014-002-095-101-002-009,14
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"A Member asked about the adequacy of the MediShield Life claim limit for cancer drug services. We have received similar feedback earlier and have recently increased the claim limit for cancer drug services from $1,200 to $3,600 per year. So, increased by three times. This is sufficient to cover the essential cancer drug services incurred by more than nine in 10 subsidised patients in our PHIs.",3,10,014-002-095-101-002-010,15
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Other Members raised concerns that generous insurance coverage, especially Integrated Shield Plans, or IPs, and IP plus riders provided by commercial insurance companies, will continue to contribute to the rapid escalation of cancer drug prices. I thank the Members for sharing the Ministry of Health (MOH)'s concern which gave rise to the recent policy changes.",4,11,014-002-095-101-002-011,16
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,But first let me explain the key reasons for the rapid rise in cancer drug prices over the past years.,5,12,014-002-095-101-002-012,17
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Firstly, as a small market, Singapore lacks negotiating power and can pay higher procurement prices. With the Cancer Drug List, or CDL, announced in August 2021, drug companies have lowered their prices in order to include their drugs in the CDL so that they can get financing coverage, namely subsidy plus MediShield, MediShield, MediShield Life and IP coverage. Since these changes, we have negotiated an average cost reduction of 30% for most drugs, and over 60% for some drugs.",6,13,014-002-095-101-002-013,18
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"We can plough the money saved on procurement costs into more subsidies. Annual Government spending on cancer drug subsidies increased from about $12 million for about 50 drugs before the CDL announcement in August 2021, to around $80 million for more than 100 drugs from September 2022.",7,14,014-002-095-101-002-014,19
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Secondly, because of the high level of anxiety surrounding cancer, high-cost cancer treatments are often prescribed even where costs are not commensurate with the established clinical benefits. Overseas studies have found that about half of new cancer treatments were introduced without evidence of benefit to survival or quality of life. However, patients and their loved ones all hope for a cure.",8,15,014-002-095-101-002-015,20
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"""As-charged"" insurance policies, including IPs and riders, are policies where coverage can be effectively limitless and patients have limited co-payment; they further encourage this practice where non-cost-effective cancer treatments are prescribed. These are ""as-charged"" insurance policies.",9,16,014-002-095-101-002-016,21
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The CDL also addresses this issue. It sends a strong signal to patients and doctors to use clinically proven and cost-effective treatments, which are covered by subsidies and MediShield Life from 1 September 2022 and IPs from April 2023.",10,17,014-002-095-101-002-017,22
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Now you still have riders which can still cover non-CDL treatments. But with the policy changes effected by the CDL, the costs of these treatments will have to be reflected in the rider premiums, rather than loaded onto MediShield Life and IP premiums for the broad majority. In other words, the high cost of non-cost-effective drugs will not be socialised.",11,18,014-002-095-101-002-018,23
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Thirdly, the mark-up of cancer drugs by some healthcare providers may be quite significant. This is again encouraged by ""as-charged"" IPs and riders, which provided for effectively limitless claims.",12,19,014-002-095-101-002-019,24
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"MOH had in 2018 taken steps to moderate this by requiring all new riders to have a minimum co-payment of 5% and typically capped at $3,000 a year, for treatments from panel doctors. From 1 April 2023, we took another step to require IPs to set claim limits for cancer drug treatments, instead of having no limits at all. So, the IPs ceased to be ""as-charged"".",13,20,014-002-095-101-002-020,25
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"For cancer drug treatments, most IPs provide coverage of up to five times that of the MediShield Life limit for treatments on the CDL. This is sufficient to cover cost-effective CDL treatments at up to 2.5 times that of unsubsidised PHI prices.",14,21,014-002-095-101-002-021,26
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,A few Members have also raised concerns that the new CDL limits for riders – such as 18 times of the MediShield Life claim limits - continue to be high and can push up cancer drug prices.,15,22,014-002-095-101-002-022,27
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,MOH shares the concern. We will review how to improve the transparency of cancer drug prices to help patients make informed decisions and encourage providers to calibrate their mark-ups.,16,23,014-002-095-101-002-023,28
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,We are also monitoring cancer drug claims and coverage closely and will work with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to take further steps to regulate IPs and riders if costs continue to escalate.,17,24,014-002-095-101-002-024,29
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In the meantime, we urge individuals to consider the long-term cost of the insurance products they purchase against the level of protection they need. The fact is that our CDL is more extensive than similar listings in most developed countries, including South Korea, Australia and the UK.",18,25,014-002-095-101-002-025,30
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,MAS also requires insurance intermediaries to properly assess if a health insurance product is suitable for a customer's needs and financial situation before recommending the product to the customer.,19,26,014-002-095-101-002-026,31

2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"  Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Minister for his reply. I have two supplementary questions. First, would the Ministry be prepared to work with the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) to develop a platform like Price Kaki which will allow patients to compare cancer drug prices across the public as well as the private hospitals and clinics? Second, pharmaceutical companies may be selling the same medications to Singaporeans at higher prices than other countries with comparable economic situations. Would the Ministry be prepared to work with MTI and CCCS to investigate this?",1,28,014-002-095-101-002-028,33
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"  Thank you. The first is a good idea. I think MOH can work on this together with the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) and the medical community, without involving the CCCS. Such price transparency itself will be quite useful. So, it is something we will study and I mentioned that in my reply.",1,29,014-002-095-101-002-029,34
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"On the Member's second question, differential pricing across countries, this is widely practised by many global suppliers, including by pharmaceutical companies. I should first say that pharmaceutical companies are our close partners in healthcare. During the COVID-19 pandemic, they are the ones who provided us with vaccines and a way out of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. So, they are our partners.",2,30,014-002-095-101-002-030,35
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But we also understand they incur quite a lot of research costs which have to be recovered through drug costs when something is approved and able to be distributed. In so doing, they too maximise their revenue by pricing the drugs in different markets differently. So, differential pricing and it is commonly done. Internationally, this is not considered something illegal; neither can MTI or CCCS do anything about it because they do not have the extraterritorial power.",3,31,014-002-095-101-002-031,36
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But what we have done is through the CDL, it gave us some negotiating leverage to talk to the pharmaceutical companies, to say, ""Please lower the prices for the drugs that you supply to Singapore. If you do so, it crosses our cost-effectiveness threshold, it can be in the CDL, and therefore, it can be subsidised and enjoy MediShield Life claims.""",4,32,014-002-095-101-002-032,37
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So far, we have been quite successful. I should reiterate a point raised in my former reply just now. Today, our CDL is actually quite extensive and in fact, longer and more comprehensive than many similar listings in many developed countries around the world.",5,33,014-002-095-101-002-033,38

2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"  Thank you, Mr Speaker. Just one supplementary question for the Minister. I understand that the CDL is a positive development for our healthcare system. But at the same time, a lot of the insurers are responding very quickly to this legislation and introducing various riders. I understand from the Minister's response the Ministry is looking into this. So, my question is whether the Ministry will look into whether insurance companies are profiteering from this. And eventually, the concern is whether or not, this could all end up as higher premiums for the various policy-holders as a result.",1,35,014-002-095-101-002-035,40
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"  Thank you. Before I directly answer the question, let me explain what is happening now.",1,36,014-002-095-101-002-036,41
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In the past, as we know, MediShield Life provides the basic level of protection. Above that, there is IP; and above whatever IP does not provide, riders would provide. So, you look at the cake as three layers.",2,37,014-002-095-101-002-037,42
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"In the past, what happens is, an IP has limitless claims. We call this ""as-charged"". But it requires some co-payment and riders sit on top of IPs to cover part of the co-payment. But with the recent changes, that relationship has been flipped. Because an IP now has quite a strict coverage of four, five times of MediShield Life. So, IP has lower coverage. It also does not cover so many drugs because non-CDL drugs are no longer covered; IP coverage has shrank. But now, the ballon is squeezed out into the rider space. Insurance companies now come in with riders with 18 times coverage – so, not ""as-charged"" but 18 times or a very high absolute number.",3,38,014-002-095-101-002-038,43
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"I think there is an impact now where it is no longer ""as-charged"" but the entire IP plus rider is now capped, albeit a very high cap. I think we need to monitor this. The way consumers respond will be quite key. If consumers heed our advice, that if you just look at our CDL which is quite comprehensive and that IP coverage is actually quite adequate; and if they stick to just buying IP, then I think the problem can be addressed.",4,39,014-002-095-101-002-039,44
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"When it comes to the riders, they should look at the price. Riders have to price in higher coverage plus more drug coverage, so they will be priced higher; and you cannot use MediSave – you can only use cash.",5,40,014-002-095-101-002-040,45
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So, if rider demand goes down and most people think IP is enough for them, I think we have addressed the problem.",6,41,014-002-095-101-002-041,46
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"But if consumer behaviour does not change and consumers continue to buy riders, notwithstanding high premiums, then, I think I agree with the Member, we may have a problem. In which case, as I had mentioned just now, together with MAS, we will be prepared to regulate IPs and riders.",7,42,014-002-095-101-002-042,47
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"The Member mentioned the word ""profiteering"". I am not sure I would describe the insurance sector that way. I think they are competing. I am not sure they are profiteering from it. But because they compete, they try to fight for market share, they offer a wide coverage – sometimes, it is, in the long term, not very sustainable for their business.",8,43,014-002-095-101-002-043,48

2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"  Based on the current design, our sense is ""no"", because now, we have isolated MediShield Life and IP with the CDL, with a limit. So, the rider itself is an outlet; and we can cover more drugs, higher limits, and it should be priced accordingly.",1,47,014-002-095-101-002-047,52
2023-04-21,Assessment of Practice where Insurers Offer Additional Coverage for Cancer Treatment through Riders,014-002-095-101-002,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"So, we will observe. My sense is that based on today's design, the answer is ""no"". In the past, the answer is ""yes"".

Mr Speaker, with regard to the incident highlighted in the Members' questions, no classified information from Singapore has been reported or detected so far. There were two pieces of information related to MINDEF contained in those ""leaks"", but they are not sensitive and they are information that is already in the public domain, namely, that the SAF uses the SPYDER air defence system and that a British Defence Singapore Support Unit is located in Sembawang to provide support services to visiting vessels from Australia, New Zealand and Britain as members of the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA).",1,5,014-002-095-101-006-005,169

This keeps the information secure but there is always a trade-off which impacts on efficiency for the organisation.

But there is a limit despite these agreements in which MINDEF/SAF can control or compel standards of protection in their systems. Therefore, their security standards form an integral part of the assessment when MINDEF awards contracts.

How does the Ministry/SAF ensure that personnel who have access to classified documents in Singapore are properly and regularly vetted to prevent any leak of information?

I think the start point is the acknowledgment that our systems, like systems everywhere, can be vulnerable to exploitation, either technologically or through human intervention.

And as the Member himself has also mentioned, there is a system of vetting and re-vetting. And this happens not only with incumbents periodically, but also whenever there are changes of personnel who are to be granted access to classified information. It is not foolproof, I agree, but, at the same time, we do it very systematically and rigorously to make sure that, to the extent possible, we take down that risk. At the same time, we constantly emphasise reminding, educating as well as emphasising the consequences of breaches to all related personnel so that everybody knows that this will not be tolerated and the full force of the law will be applied when there are breaches.",2,15,014-002-095-101-006-015,179

One importer reported encountering problems with the homologation and/or registration for EVs. It was also reported that EV models with dual electric motors require proper documentation from manufacturers that confirm their power rating and this makes it tougher for parallel importers to register these cars for road use as, unlike authorised dealers, they do not have direct contact with the car makers. Another importer stated that EV options are quite limited for parallel importers and they hope for, I quote, ""better support in terms of clarity on importing rules"".",10,33,014-002-095-101-012-033,315

It was the first-time emcees of the event used English to lead the audience, where before they had to use three languages – Mandarin, Malay and Tamil. The crowds, likewise, responded in English. Where before the different races in Singapore were like different tanks of fish in an aquarium together before your eyes but segregated from one another, now they have a common language linking them together. They still retained their mother tongues whether Chinese, Malay or Tamil? But a common knowledge of English enabled them to share together the joys of the occasion.

The late Prime Minister was clear. English would be a functional language with which to access the knowledge of the world and a tool for survival. The mother tongue is the cultural language used to transmit the culture's traditional values. More than three decades since his words in 1986, Singaporeans understand that immigration is necessary to top up our population but they also instinctively appreciate the importance of a lingua franca for better integration with newcomers and the signal it sends of Singapore as a multi-racial and multicultural nation not just in form, but in substance. So, no one should be surprised at advocacy for our lingua franca, namely English, to bind Singaporeans together. At the same time, however, we must never sever our cultural roots.

I would suggest that an English requirement for foreign spouses can be one of the criteria for fast-tracking these applicants. My proposal calls for, all other things being equal, that additional points or consideration be given for PR and citizenship to foreign spouses who have a working proficiency in English.

From the August 2023 BTO exercise, first timers who fail to choose a flat once will be deemed second timers for a year in the computer ballot. Second timers who accumulate one non-selection count, down from the current two counts, will have to wait one year before they can apply for flat again.",34,83,014-002-095-101-012-083,365

In our 2020 General Election manifesto on curbing the use of plastics, we called for the introduction of a single-use plastic charge, phased in over five years to encourage a reduction in plastic waste while looking for alternatives. This is what we said  the value of the charge would need to be sufficiently high to change behaviours but remains sensitive to the needs of lower socioeconomic groups and persons with disabilities. We called for a nationwide public education campaign to raise awareness of the effects of single-use plastics and other more sustainable alternatives. On 2 March this year, the Government announced a plastic charge at most Singapore supermarkets from 3 July 2023, with two-thirds of all supermarkets imposing a charge of at least five cents for each carrier bag.",35,84,014-002-095-101-012-084,366

In our 2015 General Election manifesto seven years ago, the WP called for the family doctor pairing scheme. We argue that pairing families with GPs would encourage patients to remain with one family doctor who would be more familiar with their background and medical history. This would facilitate earlier detection of illnesses, provide more accurate diagnosis, reduce duplication of treatment and improve coordination with other care providers.

We suggested that employees who work for a company with more than 20 employees for more than six months should be allowed to make requests for flexible working arrangements.

Had the question on the WP position on the GST per se been asked then, the answer would have been obvious. The WP policy positions cannot be immutable and have to evolve with the political realities of the time.

Mr Leon Perera had – if my memory serves me correctly and I stand corrected, Mr Speaker, I am going based on memory alone – asked the question on the number of intra-corporate transferees in 2016. And the answer in Parliament from the Minister for Manpower was, ""we don't reveal these numbers."" And the point we were making – and the point I made in my speech again today – was if those numbers were released, because the numbers were low – they could have punctured all that xenophobia quite early. And the point I am making was I could not understand why it was difficult to provide the information in 2016.

I made the same point and there is no real difference in the point that I am making now. And this is what he said in my response to releasing information earlier  ""I take to heart what the Leader of the Opposition has said that, with information, we can quell such falsehoods much earlier. We work in a bureaucracy. Some data is classified secret, confidential and so on. So, we are not at liberty to always disclose them. But what you say is true.

I am glad he acknowledges and he shares my point about having this common social compact. But I hope that in terms of perhaps prioritising some of these questions and having a more precise and surgical differentiated way of asking these questions could be one way of making it a lot easier.",1,153,014-002-095-101-012-153,435

What the Leader of the Opposition said in his speech, I think it was a similar point that he made in the July 2021 debate, which was that if only MOM released the number early, you could have quelled all the xenophobia. I took that point.",1,155,014-002-095-101-012-155,437
2023-04-21,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-101-012,The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"And my answer in July 2021, I think it is the same answer today. We take to heart the feedback that the Member gave. If we have released, perhaps, it would have quelled all the xenophobia and all the raw emotions. But as Minister Tan See Leng said, that data was graded confidential or maybe even secret, I am not sure. But it was not ready for release, because when you release intra-corporate transferees of a particular country, others may compare, it can have other ramifications. So, it is not something that Ministry officials will readily say, ""Let us release it for Parliament"". But the situation became like that. CECA became a big issue with a lot of raw emotions, got debated here. In the end, these Ministers had a serious discussion and said ""Let us release it"". And so, we take your point but it is not that straightforward a matter but nevertheless.",2,156,014-002-095-101-012-156,438

It is not because of that. No. If we are honest with ourselves, it is not because of that. It could have quelled it.

But because Minister Ong mentioned yesterday in the context of presenting alternative budgets, alternative agendas, he said, ""just file a question, you'll get a written answer"". I think that caused me to pause. Because the answer that was given in 2016 – and again, I stand corrected if my memory fails me – was not that the reason we are not releasing the ICT data was because there could be commercial sensitivities and so forth. In fact, there was no reason given at all, if I am not wrong. It was ""We don't release this figure, period"".",1,159,014-002-095-101-012-159,441

And I have to add, again, I am going back six years. So, I remember the question of CECA did not just drop from the sky in 2015, 2016, 2017, around that period. Factually, the Government website, also had to come out and clarify some of these issues. So, in that context, I am not blaming MOM or pointing the finger at MOM, but making a larger meta point about how important it can be for information to be released and to take a different attitude towards it.",2,160,014-002-095-101-012-160,442

Take, for example, the idea of supporting workers to take time off to train. The reality is, many companies, especially SMEs, find it challenging to give ""time off"" to train, and this is exacerbated by the experience that some SME owners have shared with me – that their employees do not seem to bring something useful back to the business after going for training, so, it is almost like sending them on a holiday.

Earlier this month, President Halimah and I met our Youth Corps leaders at the commencement ceremony of the leaders' programme. One of them, Lim Jia Yi, led a project called We+65. Started in 2022, this project reaches out to the less mobile seniors in Sembawang, with activities that helped to improve their mobility as well as their cognitive functions. And it was borne of her realisation that perhaps the seniors were less connected and had less resources available to them.",64,483,014-002-095-101-012-483,765

If you speak to Jia Yi, her sense of responsibility of her commitment to community will shine through clearly. She is passionate about reaching out across generations to befriend seniors, even as she herself is currently a full-time medical student. Busy as she is, she volunteers her time in many other charitable projects and events as well.

2023-04-21,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-101-012,Mr Pritam Singh,"Sir, I have two clarifications. The first is this. I did not say that an English requirement would be a single point of consideration for PRs and new citizenship applications. I think the Minister, in his characterisation, framed it as a sort of litmus test. In fact, I made it clear in my speech today that it was a nudge to align our immigration policy and our bilingual policy.",2,493,014-002-095-101-012-493,775

The existing criteria would apply and it would be a consideration when an immigration decision is considered – that actually this person already has a common lingua franca that many Singaporeans actually share. So, I think the point was a little more nuanced than what the Minister enunciated.",3,494,014-002-095-101-012-494,776
2023-04-21,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-101-012,Mr Pritam Singh,"I think the second point is international students who are today foreigners; if they want to enter our primary school system, they already have to take a Cambridge English qualification test.

2023-04-21,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-101-012,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"  I thank Mr Singh for that clarification. And perhaps, with your clarification it now appears that we are not that far apart, because you did use the phrase ""English test"" when you first raised it. I think it was during COS. And so, when I heard your speech then and earlier today, a test is a test you either pass or you fail. And there must be consequences if you do not pass. So, it was in that context that I said let us not use it as a single point consideration.

I think we all want to ensure that we can communicate with the people we see in Singapore, at least to a basic degree. And I can see where that is coming from.

Based on the National Population Health Survey, there was a slight decrease in the crude prevalence of diabetes in adults from 8.8% in 2017 to 8.5% in 2022. After adjusting for ageing effect in the population, a reduction in the age-standardised prevalence of diabetes from 7.8% in 2017 to 6.8% in 2022 was observed. These statistics suggest some progress in blunting a hitherto increasing trend.

This is useful in countries that experience prolonged low visibility conditions in the day, such as during winter and foggy conditions. We do not experience such conditions often, so there is no strong need to mandate DRLs in Singapore. Nonetheless, there are quite a few car models that have DRLs installed. In dimly lit environments, such as multi-storey carparks and in other low visibility conditions such as heavy rain, motorists should ensure that their headlamps are switched on so that they are able to see the road clearly and can be seen by other road users.",1,2,014-002-095-101-030-002,907
