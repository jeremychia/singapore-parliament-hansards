2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Dr Tan Wu Meng,asked the Prime Minister (a) how many polling stations experienced technical issues with the electronic voter registration system during the 2023 Presidential Election; (b) whether cyber interference for the technical issues experienced has been ruled out; and (c) what is being done to (i) ensure that all who voted were correctly registered and (ii) prevent a repeat of situations where persons remember voting in the 2020 General Election but which names were not in the 2023 updated Registers of Electors.,1,1,014-002-095-112-001-001,1
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Pritam Singh,asked the Prime Minister in view of the Elections Department’s press statement dated 24 August 2023 regarding the wrongful removal of names from the Registers of Electors after General Election 2020 (a) how many times has this happened in the aftermath of past elections or by-elections; and (b) what steps will be taken to prevent a re-occurrence.,1,2,014-002-095-112-001-002,2
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Ms He Ting Ru,asked the Prime Minister regarding voters who were removed from the electoral register due to an error (a) what was the total number of voters affected; (b) whether there was any individual notification exercise to expunged voters in reminding them to add their name back to the register since the last such exercise in 2019; and (c) why was a tally of the number of NRICs scanned and the number of votes collected after the last general election not conducted as a first instance check.,1,3,014-002-095-112-001-003,3
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Liang Eng Hwa,asked the Prime Minister (a) what are the reasons resulting in the names of about 200 Singaporeans not being reflected in the Registers of Electors eligible to vote at Presidential Election 2023 despite voting in General Election 2020; and (b) what are measures taken to prevent such recurrence.,1,4,014-002-095-112-001-004,4
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing) (for the Prime Minister),"Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Prime Minister, may I have your permission to answer Question Nos 1 to 4 by Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Mr Pritam Singh, Dr Tan Wu Meng and Ms He Ting Ru on today’s Order Paper, please?",1,5,014-002-095-112-001-005,5

2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Let me first set out the Elections Department (ELD)’s key executional objectives at every election – which is to ensure  firstly, that only bona fide voters are issued with ballot papers; secondly that no extra ones were put in; and thirdly that all votes cast are counted, so that the election result is determined by the eligible voters for that election.",1,7,014-002-095-112-001-007,7
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"To achieve this, we have put in place a set of procedures that need to be complied with.",2,8,014-002-095-112-001-008,8
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Let me explain. Upon the voter’s arrival at the polling station, the election official will verify his identity and eligibility to vote at the polling station, and then register the voter’s attendance via a hard copy polling station register or the electronic registration system. Thereafter, the voter is directed to the ballot paper issuance counter. The election official issuing the ballot paper is required, by law, to read out the name and voter serial number of a voter before the voter is issued a ballot paper. This allows the polling agents to mark their copy of the register and provide an additional check to ensure that only eligible voters in the register for that polling station are individually issued with a ballot paper. As a result, when the votes are tallied for an election, we can be confident that the outcome is the one decided by the eligible voters for that election.",3,9,014-002-095-112-001-009,9
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"After the end of each election, ELD compiles the list of voters registered to have voted on Polling Day and compares them against the list of voters in the certified Registers of Electors for the election. Those who were not registered as having voted on Polling Day are included in the list of non-voters, which is published after each election for inspection. The non-voter list contains the names of people who have not turned up to vote. The vast majority of them did not vote either because they were not in Singapore or were ill on Polling Day. For these cases, their names were not crossed out in the hard copy polling registers as they did not turn up at the polling stations.",4,10,014-002-095-112-001-010,10
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"After each election, there would be a few voters who claimed that they had voted even though upon checking, their names were not crossed out in the hard copy polling registers. Thus, in reply to Mr Pritam Singh’s question, prior to the introduction of electronic registration at General Election 2020 (GE2020), ELD encountered only a few cases of voters who were on the non-voter list who claimed that they had voted.",5,11,014-002-095-112-001-011,11
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"For GE2020, GE2015 and GE2011, ELD recorded about 111,000, 155,000 and 147,000 non-voters respectively. As can be seen, the non-voter list for GE2020 was much smaller, rather than bigger than the two previous GEs.",6,12,014-002-095-112-001-012,12
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"As per every election, ELD published the non-voter list for voters to verify, about three months after GE2020. This was publicised via a press release on 5 October 2020 which was covered by mainstream media.",7,13,014-002-095-112-001-013,13
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Ms He asked why a tally of the number of NRICs scanned and the number of votes cast after the last general election was not conducted as a first instance check. Given the much lower number of non-voters for GE2020 compared to the two general elections before, ELD did not suspect that an unusual number of voters had not been recorded as registered. Checking the registration figures at the end of Polling Day may also not be instructive – and this is because the process to ensure voting secrecy means that we will not be able to identify individual voters, including those who had not been registered accurately and would therefore be listed as non-voters in due course. Furthermore, every voter receives only one ballot paper and the ballot boxes which contain all of the cast ballot papers are always in the custody of election officials, properly sealed with polling and counting agents able to witness this process and secured while in transit.",8,14,014-002-095-112-001-014,14
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Ahead of Presidential Election 2023 (PE2023), ELD publicised that the revised Registers were available for inspection from 15 June 2023 and that the certified Registers which contains updated information from the inspection period were available for inspection from 21 July 2023. These exercises were carried out to enable Singaporeans to check their details and restore their names to the Registers ahead of the election.",9,15,014-002-095-112-001-015,15
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"From October 2020 to the day of the Writ in August this year, some 32,000 voters checked and restored their names. Similar to previous exercises, there were very few who requested ELD to restore their names due to inaccuracy in the recording of their voting status in GE2020. As such, ELD did not suspect that there were significant inaccuracies in the recording.",10,16,014-002-095-112-001-016,16
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The list of non-voters had been opened for inspection shortly after the GE2020 and the public were reminded that the registers were available for inspection in June and July 2023 before the Writ for PE2023 was issued. Voters need not wait for these periods, but are able to check their status in the registers all year round either through Voter Services on ELD’s website, at any of the over 100 community centres or clubs or by calling ELD.",11,17,014-002-095-112-001-017,17
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"However, there remained some voters who did not check that their names were on the Registers. After the Writ was issued for PE2023 and up to Polling Day, 1,093 Singaporeans informed the ELD that they did not receive their poll card even though they said that they had voted in GE2020. For context, this number averages one voter per polling station, which had an average of 2,400 registered voters in GE2020. So, this is about one voter per polling station with an average of 2,400 registered voters in GE2020. Further, ELD’s analysis of the distribution of the affected voters showed that there is no pattern across the polling stations and that the 1,093 cases were distributed across more than 500 polling stations.",12,18,014-002-095-112-001-018,18
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"ELD has investigated this and concluded that the most probable cause of the error was that the NRIC details of these affected voters had not been captured properly by the electronic registration system, which was only introduced from GE2020. This is because the proper registration procedure may not have been followed for the affected voters, especially in some of the more crowded stations.",13,19,014-002-095-112-001-019,19
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Let me explain. A voter’s NRIC and poll card are first checked by election officials at the registration counter before the NRIC is scanned to register the voter. When the NRIC of a voter is scanned by the barcode reader, an alert or ""beep"" sound will be emitted, and a digital screen will flash an ""OK"" button, indicating that the voter data has been successfully captured in the system. At this point, the election official should tap the ""OK"" button to return to the registration screen so that the NRIC of the next voter can be scanned.",14,20,014-002-095-112-001-020,20
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"If the NRIC of the next voter is scanned when the screen has not returned to the registration screen, the alert sound will still be emitted, as this indicates that the NRIC has been scanned. However, the record of this voter would not have been captured. It is likely that in their effort to clear the queues at some polling stations quickly in GE2020, some election officials might have missed out this step. As a result, the registration of the affected voters was not captured.",15,21,014-002-095-112-001-021,21
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"For PE2023, we implemented a new electronic registration system with a simplified process. Election officials need not press any button to return to the registration screen to register the next voter. Therefore, the issue of non-captured registrations as a result of not pressing a button would no longer arise.",16,22,014-002-095-112-001-022,22
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Dr Tan asked what is being done to ensure that all who voted were registered and Dr Tan, Mr Singh and Mr Liang also asked what will be done to prevent a recurrence where those who had voted were inadvertently removed from the Registers. Going forward, besides making a public call for voters to check their status when the non-voter list is published for verification, ELD will institute an additional measure to individually inform Singaporeans on the non-voter list via mail and through SG Notify in Singpass to verify their status, and to restore their names to the Registers if need be. We thank Ms Ng Ling Ling for her suggestion.",17,23,014-002-095-112-001-023,23
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Dr Tan asked about the number of polling stations that experienced technical issues with the electronic registration system during the recent PE2023. Based on ELD’s preliminary investigations, there was a 30% average loss in device connectivity in the first hour of polling and this reduced to 16% by 10.00 am. There was no evidence that this was caused by cyber-attacks. Instead, this could have been partly contributed by the surge in the volume of transactions during the morning peak, where about 52% of the total number of voters had already voted in the first four hours, compared to 32% in GE2020.",18,24,014-002-095-112-001-024,24

2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The number of polling stations was increased by 15% to 1,264 stations, from the 1,097 stations in GE2020. This reduced the average number of voters assigned to a polling station from about 2,400 voters in GE2020 to 2,150 voters in PE2023.",20,26,014-002-095-112-001-026,26
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Each polling station also had more e-Registration devices than before, from between two to four devices each, proportionate to the number of voters in the polling stations, with an additional spare device each for contingency. For reference, a polling station with only two e-Registration devices can process at least six voters per min on average, which is a 50% higher throughput compared to the manual registration rate which does so at an average of four voters per minute.",21,27,014-002-095-112-001-027,27

As a result, by about 9.55 am, ELD had reported that queues had improved at most stations. We would also like to thank voters who had to queue longer during the morning of peak hours Polling Day, for their patience and understanding.",22,28,014-002-095-112-001-028,28

Let me first declare that I have Clementi residents who were affected and shared their concerns with me as their Member of Parliament. I declare that I have a Clementi resident who remembered voting in 2020, but in 2023, found she was not on the Registers belatedly and she regrets not having had the chance to vote and choose her President at the ballot box that day. I also have Clementi residents who saw how hard our election officials, how hard our public officers worked and the heroic efforts made by our public officers when technical difficulties arose.",1,31,014-002-095-112-001-031,31

Can I ask the Minister, I note that the ELD website mentions ""Your vote decides the future of Singapore"". How we design these systems also shapes the voting process as well. Can Minister assure us that ELD will do its level best to learn from this and continue improving, in particular, contractor specifications, tender requirements, so that the situations like these can be avoided in future?",6,36,014-002-095-112-001-036,36

2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"I will start with the third one. Yes, definitely, ELD will continue to improve just as per every election. We will take in the debrief and feedback from all members of the public and also Members in this Chamber and they will continue to seek to strive better, be it process wise or the technical issues that we face. So, that is the third question that Dr Tan asked.",2,38,014-002-095-112-001-038,38
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The second one, on the issue of reliability, yes, indeed, ELD has specifications on the reliability standards. And let me perhaps take this question a bit further to explain what we mean by ""reliability standards"". The reliability of a system depends on a few parts – and to answer the second question, all these were also stress tested. First, we have to make sure that the hardware is functioning well. Second, we have to make sure that the connectivity between the over 4,500 systems all around the island, is connected well and has certain redundancy. And third, we have to make sure that the software is also working fine.",3,39,014-002-095-112-001-039,39
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Sir, as I have explained, the first is that, for this particular PE, we have ruled out the issue of a cyber-attack. The second is that we have also checked that the hardware has worked well and it was not the main contributing factor to the slowness in the first few hours, the slowness that started at 8.30 am that lasted until about 10.00 am during Polling Day. The third thing is about the connectivity. For all the polling stations, we had double redundancy to make sure that we did not rely on any particular network and this was also stress tested during the run-up. In fact, ELD undertook the technical tests. Prior to Polling Day itself, they conducted full-dress rehearsals with all the devices on, to check the connectivity issues and the hardware issues; and they were satisfied that they were all in working condition.",4,40,014-002-095-112-001-040,40
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"ELD, in the initial findings, has pretty much narrowed this down to a technical issue that has to do with the software. And let me explain it in laymen terms as follows. In ELD's stress tests, they stress test a certain volume of transactions within a certain amount of time. So, this election, notwithstanding the fact that within the first four hours, 52% of the people have voted compared to 32% in the last GE, we had stress tested that scenario.",5,41,014-002-095-112-001-041,41
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"But there was one particular feature that perhaps, on hindsight, the technical officers could have looked deeper into. And that is when all the devices were sending messages to the central server and when the inordinate amount of surge happened, some of the messages did not get through. And when the packets of messages did not get through, the system kept trying. And because as the system kept trying, it continued to pile up a backlog of packets that have to be cleared.",6,42,014-002-095-112-001-042,42
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"When ELD technical officers realised this, after 8.30 am when this thing happened, they quickly increased the memory and computing power capacity, and this helped us to quickly resolve the issue. So, if you like, some messages did not get through, they continue to pile up, creating a backlog and it caused a bit of a cascade effect. But with the quick discovery of this problem, the ELD officiers were able to quickly increase the computing power and also the memory in order to clear the backlog. But, once the backlog had set in, it took us about an hour plus to clear the backlog and return the clearance speed to normal.",7,43,014-002-095-112-001-043,43
2023-09-19,Technical Issues with Electronic Registration System for Polling that Resulted in Removal of Voter Names from Registers of Electors,014-002-095-112-001,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"But I must say, even with assurance about the redundancy, ELD's planning norms are such that in every polling station, even if the electronic registration systems failed, we will be able to clear the queues with the manual processes, as we had done in the past. So, the baseline is that manual processes will allow us to comfortably clear all the voters in that polling station. On top of that, if this supplemented by the electronic system, it will help us to speed up the clearance even faster. Which is why, for this particular PE, even though there were 52% of the voters voting in the first four hours, by about 10.00 am in the morning, we had pretty much managed to clear all the queues and clear 52% of the voters within the first four hours.",8,44,014-002-095-112-001-044,44

Based on the Minister's reply, will the ELD be sending letters and notifications to all non-voters in GE2020 who have not applied to put themselves back on the Registers of Electors to ensure that no voter has been struck off, due to the additional steps in the electronic registration system process that was employed in GE2020?",1,46,014-002-095-112-001-046,46

Is this necessary or is the purpose still meaningful today, given that it can open up to potential operational slips and also additional administrative work for the ELD and the voters as well to go and put back their names?

We thank Mr Liang Eng Hwa for his feedback. Precisely because voting is compulsory, the election acts require that the names of the non-voters be expunged from the Registers if they did not vote. This is in the election acts. And a penalty of $50 must be paid for one's name to be restored if he or she does not provide a valid reason for not voting. The penalty is waived if the voter is able to provide a valid reason such as being overseas on Polling Day. Otherwise, he or she will no longer be able to vote in future elections, or to stand nominated as a candidate for elections. In other words, the penalty for not voting and the process of expunging the names of non-voters, give effect to the notion of compulsory voting. Starting on a clean slate with no penalty will undermine this.",1,51,014-002-095-112-001-051,51

I have two supplementary questions for the Minister. The first being, leaving aside secrecy which of course we agree is very important, does ELD have data about how many total identity cards (ICs) were scanned during the GE2020 elections versus how many votes were eventually recorded as being cast during the elections? That would actually give us a first instance indication of whether there is any discrepancy beyond the 1,097 voters that have contacted ELD to say that they voted but their names were erroneously removed from the Register.

I am just wondering whether we can do a one-off sweep to all voters, including voters that were removed from the Registers prior to GE2020 and PE2023, to ask them to take action to put their names back on. And also, in that vein, whether or not we can make it standard practice, after every election, that ELD would then send out a notice to voters who did not vote, asking them to apply, so that you do not just rely on press releases?",2,54,014-002-095-112-001-054,54

Let me answer Ms He Ting Ru's first question. At the end of every Polling Day, there will be a combination of electronic records in the current system plus some manual records. Because in instances whereby the electronic system malfunctions or fails for whatever reason, we will have to rely on the manual record. So, at the end of each Polling Day, we would not immediately have the numbers because there is the electronic dataset, which we have to also reconcile with the manual set. So, that is the answer to the first question. And even if we can reconcile it immediately, it will not be able to tell us who are the non-voters accurately.",1,55,014-002-095-112-001-055,55

As I have explained in my reply, once the reconciliation is done, from that period until the next election when the Writ is issued, at any point in time, the voters can check their status. And we agree with you; we encourage all the voters to check their status anytime. It is not just only during the period whereby ELD publicises this.

And then, from October 2020 to August 2023, 32,000 individuals applied to restore their names. So, this 32,000 would have to be a part of this 111,000 who were non-voters.

There are 111,000 non-voters. The vast bulk of these non-voters, be it in GE2011, GE2015 or GE2020, were either overseas or some of them could be very old and very frail and did not vote.

I have three supplementary questions. First, we understand that MOH last reviewed the income criteria in 2019, which was pre-COVID and inflation was still low.

While he supports the idea of paternity leave, he was concerned about the short-term impact on his business. And while the Government's commitment to reimburse wage costs is reassuring, the potential disruption to business operations is a valid concern.

A key factor affecting fathers' utilisation of paternity leave is workplace support. This includes whether supervisors are adequately assuring that using paternity leave will not affect fathers' career prospects and that colleagues are willing to cover fathers' duties in their absence. We will continue to explore ways to encourage employers to support all fathers to use their paternity leave such as by raising awareness of the benefits of providing a family-friendly workplace culture.",6,52,014-002-095-112-016-052,290

These movements look at strengthening family ties and resilience with the aim of increasing marriage stability as well as advocating the importance of shared parenting and household responsibilities between mothers and fathers. For example, the Centre for Fathering runs several campaigns throughout the year to reinforce and signal the importance of fathers’ active involvement in their child’s development.

Approved Persons must be able to fulfil their roles and responsibilities specified in the Child Development Co-Savings Regulations as well as MSF's Terms and Conditions for Approved Persons and Approved Institutions.,67,113,014-002-095-112-016-113,351
2023-09-19,Child Development Co-Savings (Amendment) Bill,014-002-095-112-016,The Minister of State for Social and Family Development (Ms Sun Xueling),"For those who have not been proper in carrying out their role as an Approved Person, MSF will suspend their approval. The suspension safeguards the child's CDA funds but does not mean that the relevant Approved Institution has to cease service provision for the child. For instance, a preschool can continue its delivery of services as long as remains licensed by ECDA. In the past three years, one Approved Person has been suspended due to their failure to keep proper records.",68,114,014-002-095-112-016-114,352
2023-09-19,Child Development Co-Savings (Amendment) Bill,014-002-095-112-016,The Minister of State for Social and Family Development (Ms Sun Xueling),"The amendments to section 7 provide for a simplified process wherein revocation of the approval granted to these Approved Persons does not need to be approved by the Minister. This would be applied in specific situations that can be determined objectively, such as where the Approved Institution is no longer able to provide services because it has ceased operations. This serves to improve operational efficiency.",69,115,014-002-095-112-016-115,353

The amendments being made to the Child Development Co-Savings Act via this Bill is a clear signal of the Government's continued commitment to increase our support for parents in managing their work and family commitments.

2023-09-19,Society of Saint Maur Incorporation (Amendment) Bill,014-002-095-112-017,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"Sir, the Bill seeks to amend the Society of Saint Maur Incorporation Ordinance 1923. The Ordinance was enacted in 1923 to incorporate The Lady Superior in Penang of the Society of Saint Maur and her successors as a corporation sole, to allow for perpetual succession under the name, “The Lady Superior of the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus in Penang”. The Society of Saint Maur is more commonly known as the Infant Jesus Sisters, or IJ Sisters, in Singapore.",2,4,014-002-095-112-017-004,368
2023-09-19,Society of Saint Maur Incorporation (Amendment) Bill,014-002-095-112-017,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"The order arose in response to the dire need in those days to provide young girls, especially those from disadvantaged families, with a good education. Arising from this mission, the IJ Sisters arrived in Singapore in 1854 and went on to found 11 Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus schools for girls in Singapore as well as an orphanage, home and children’s centre. They also provide after-school care for children. Over 169 years of history in Singapore, scores of girls have had their lives transformed through the work of the IJ Sisters.",3,5,014-002-095-112-017-005,369

2023-09-19,Society of Saint Maur Incorporation (Amendment) Bill,014-002-095-112-017,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),"The Bill updates the name references in the Ordinance, given historical developments and current conventions. Following Singapore’s Independence in 1965, and the eventual reorganisation of the IJ Sisters, the IJ Sisters now have a Lady Superior in Singapore and a Lady Superior in Malaysia. The amendment gives recognition to this independence and allows the IJ Sisters in Singapore to grow with its own distinct identity.",5,7,014-002-095-112-017-007,371
2023-09-19,Society of Saint Maur Incorporation (Amendment) Bill,014-002-095-112-017,Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar),The reference to “Penang” in the corporation’s name will thus be removed. The Bill also makes further amendments so that the references to the “Lady Superior in Penang of the Society of Saint Maur” in the Ordinance refer to the Lady Superior who is appointed for Singapore and not any other successor of the Lady Superior.,6,8,014-002-095-112-017-008,372

In response to a clarification by Mr Dennis Tan as to whether the reduced pay comprised both the Minister's pay and MP allowance, the Prime Minister explained that Mr Iswaran's MP allowance was not interdicted, as unlike a Minister's pay, it was not at the discretion of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister pointed out that it was a matter for Parliament and that Parliament had not done that, nor in previous cases, has it done so.

Mr Leong then replied that it only pertains to investigation by CPIB. But why only cases involving CPIB?

He has been placed on leave of absence and, hence, is not able to attend Parliament. So, I do not understand why this rush to suspend him. Why not allow the CPIB time to do its work?

It also goes against the principle of retrospective criminality for us to see what has happened and then decide that is wrong.

Leave of absence, in and of itself per se, cannot be a reason for suspension. If that were so, then we would have to suspend Mr Faisal Manap. He was on leave of absence because he was ill. But we do not do that, because he was ill. So, in other words, it is not the leave of absence in and of itself. It is the reason why you have to take leave of absence. And in this case, Mr Iswaran was effectively asked to take leave of absence because it is untenable for him to perform his duties as a Minister and it will be very difficult for him to perform his duties as an MP whilst under investigation.

2023-09-19,"Consideration of Matters regarding Member of Parliament, and Suspension of Member",014-002-095-112-020,The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Mr Singh had a question. Mr Singh supports the position that Mr Iswaran should not be suspended at this point in time, I think. His second question, though, was, what should Parliament do in the interim period. And I think his position was that it might be appropriate to suspend his MP allowance. That is what I think Mr Singh said.",39,149,014-002-095-112-020-149,631

It is a binary position  if the person is a sitting MP, he receives the full allowance. If the Member is suspended, then he does not get any allowance. So, the law does not provide for anything in between.",40,150,014-002-095-112-020-150,632

We will look at it again when we know if the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) intends to bring any charges and if so, what the charges are. We will consider a claw back, if justified.

First, it is important to remember that there is a distinction between Mr Iswaran's role as a Minister and his role as an MP. As a Minister, he was appointed by the Prime Minister. So, he holds that position at the Prime Minister's pleasure. The Prime Minister, therefore, also has the ability to interdict him and to tell him to stop carrying out duties as Minister, whilst he is under investigation. That is because his appointment flowed or came from the Prime Minister.",1,196,014-002-095-112-020-196,678

2023-09-19,"Consideration of Matters regarding Member of Parliament, and Suspension of Member",014-002-095-112-020,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Then, there is the issue of Mr Iswaran's status as an MP. Mr Iswaran's status as an MP was not by appointment by the Prime Minister or otherwise. He was elected. He was elected by the constituents of West Coast GRC. His mandate comes from them, and you can only suspend or take away his ability to act as an MP in accordance with the PPIPA.

But as a matter of party discipline, he has been requested by the Prime Minister to also cease his MP duties because you can imagine how difficult it is to carry out your MP duties when you are under investigation or even to come to Parliament.

Based on NTUC's internal tracking, within just three months of exiting the HSP, 13 workers tragically lost their lives between June and August 2023. I must add the caveat that this is not an official figure as the cases are a collation of inputs from our unions and associations.

This is a set of principles that prioritises the safety of workers when designing the worksite. Today, MOM has in place the WSH (Design for Safety) Regulations that specify the duties of developers, contractors and designers. This should be reviewed and expanded.

Currently, the Courts can and do reduce sentences, in appropriate cases, if accused persons plead guilty. Such reductions are granted by the Court in recognition that a plea of guilt by an accused person may have significant benefits, including allowing victims to find closure early and sparing victims and witnesses the need to prepare for a trial and testify in Court.

This is intended to provide increased consistency, clarity and transparency to the existing sentencing practice.

2023-09-19,Gender Pay Gap for Finance-related Roles and Steps to Close the Gap,014-002-095-112-026,Dr Tan See Leng,"In the financial and insurance services sector, the gender pay gap has narrowed from 27.1% in 2012 to 15.6% in 2022. Part of this gap is because more men are in higher-paying occupations, such as managing directors, chief executive officers and fund or portfolio managers in this sector. This gender pay gap also does not account for other factors, such as differences in hours worked, experience and education. If we account for these factors, the gender pay gap would be lower.",1,2,014-002-095-112-026-002,822
2023-09-19,Gender Pay Gap for Finance-related Roles and Steps to Close the Gap,014-002-095-112-026,Dr Tan See Leng,"One of the ways to further reduce the gender pay gap is to help employees better balance work and family responsibilities so that they are able to maximise their potential at work. This is particularly important for women as they tend to bear heavier caregiving responsibilities at home. The Tripartite Partners will continue to encourage family-friendly workplace practices, such as flexible work arrangements. Parental leave schemes have also been enhanced to promote greater sharing of caregiving duties across genders. The upcoming Workplace Fairness Legislation will also strengthen protections against common forms of discrimination, including discrimination on the basis of sex, pregnancy status and caregiving responsibilities.",2,3,014-002-095-112-026-003,823

There are about 1,700 occupied flats under the Interim Rental Housing (IRH) scheme, which is offered on a case-by-case basis to lower-income families who are in transit between longer-term options. As there continues to be sustained demand for public rental flats, we expect the number of occupied public rental flats to increase slightly over the next year, but we will seek to keep waiting times stable.",1,2,014-002-095-112-027-002,827
2023-09-19,Update on Occupancy and Waiting Time for HDB Rental Flats,014-002-095-112-027,Mr Desmond Lee,There are about 900 occupied flats under the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS).

We will double the PPHS flat supply from about 2,000 units at present to 4,000 units by the end of 2025. Nonetheless, supply remains limited and we will not be able to offer a PPHS flat to every applicant. As such, potential PPHS applicants are encouraged to consider their full range of options, including open market rental, or living with their families.",3,4,014-002-095-112-027-004,829

There may be a promising new precision medicine which may work only on certain individuals and cost significantly more.,1,2,014-002-095-112-028-002,831
2023-09-19,Regulating Artificial Intelligence and New Technologies for Precision Medicines,014-002-095-112-028,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Having said that, the healthcare sector is characterised by very tight regulation. In Singapore, any new technologies, including the use of AI, are regulated by the Health Sciences Authority as medical devices if they diagnose, manage or treat medical conditions. For example, clinical genetic and genomic services will be regulated as part of the Healthcare Services Act in end 2023.

The standing policy is to allow each cohort to start their university studies in the same year and thus these later enlistees were disrupted to achieve this outcome. Twenty-seven percent are NSFs who were disrupted to study medicine, so that they can serve their National Service (NS) as SAF Medical Officers. Public Service Commission scholars make up the remaining 3% or an average of 19 NSFs.
