The actual median and average figures should be higher as the existing data does not take into account nurses who switched hospitals but remained in the public healthcare sector.",2,3,014-001-095-075-001-003,3

2022-11-09,Length of Service of Foreign Nurses Employed at Restructured Hospitals,014-001-095-075-001,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"  Thank you, Sir. I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the reply. Could I just ask what is the current shortfall in terms of foreign nurses that we are planning to hire?",1,5,014-001-095-075-001-005,5
2022-11-09,Length of Service of Foreign Nurses Employed at Restructured Hospitals,014-001-095-075-001,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Secondly, I think Minister Ong Ye Kung yesterday mentioned how we are ramping up our efforts to hire foreign nurses. So, could I ask whether there is a timeline for this and when do we expect to be able to meet this shortfall?",2,6,014-001-095-075-001-006,6
2022-11-09,Length of Service of Foreign Nurses Employed at Restructured Hospitals,014-001-095-075-001,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"  Deputy Speaker, I thank the Member for the questions. I wanted to go back to the points that had been raised in the discussion during the Healthier SG White Paper debate and the further Parliamentary Questions (PQs) that had been raised in the past. Minister Ong Ye Kung had also given an indication of these numbers, extensively, during the debate on the White Paper.",1,7,014-001-095-075-001-007,7
2022-11-09,Length of Service of Foreign Nurses Employed at Restructured Hospitals,014-001-095-075-001,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"We are looking at, by 2030, to have 82,000 nurses, allied health and support care staff, up from the 58,000 that we have today. A large portion of these numbers would be for nurses. This is something that we have already been working on and the target is by 2030 to up these numbers. The clusters are doing their best to step up recruitment efforts.",2,8,014-001-095-075-001-008,8
2022-11-09,Length of Service of Foreign Nurses Employed at Restructured Hospitals,014-001-095-075-001,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Minister Ong had earlier indicated that even in as far as our local intake is concerned, we have looked at the intakes at the schools, the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), Polytechnics and Universities. This is also going to be increased over time. We have about 2,100 from them and we are looking at increasing to 2,300.",3,9,014-001-095-075-001-009,9
2022-11-09,Length of Service of Foreign Nurses Employed at Restructured Hospitals,014-001-095-075-001,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"These are the different efforts that are being put in place. We have discussed this extensively at the White Paper debate. With all the efforts in place, we are hoping to see a better number. We are not just looking at the shortfall. It is also important for us to also see what other needs there may be. So, these are the aspects we look at for the efforts we are doing.",4,10,014-001-095-075-001-010,10

2022-11-09,Length of Service of Foreign Nurses Employed at Restructured Hospitals,014-001-095-075-001,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"  I have those numbers, but those numbers include both local and foreign. I am asking if we have a number specifically for foreign nurses. I think we debated this before that the problem is that a lot of the foreign nurses have left. And that is why there is a huge burden on the local nurses now. I am just wondering what is the shortfall in terms of foreign nurses and how we intend to meet that shortfall.",1,12,014-001-095-075-001-012,12
2022-11-09,Length of Service of Foreign Nurses Employed at Restructured Hospitals,014-001-095-075-001,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"  As I mentioned earlier, we do not only just look at shortfall and work towards just filling up the shortfall. We are also having to look at the demands of the public and what are the needs. We do not necessarily find it valuable to make that distinction.",1,13,014-001-095-075-001-013,13
2022-11-09,Length of Service of Foreign Nurses Employed at Restructured Hospitals,014-001-095-075-001,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"As much as possible, we try and see what are the different avenues and channels for us to increase this intake and we are making efforts on that front. We have explained how we have worked with the clusters to see how we can see to the well-being of the nurses and improve the stature of their career, career paths as well as increasing the intake from the different schools. This is an aspect that we are doing and that will never be enough – to reach the 82,000 that we are looking for. Hence, we have to complement that with the efforts we are doing in recruitment of overseas nurses.",2,14,014-001-095-075-001-014,14

2022-11-09,Length of Service of Foreign Nurses Employed at Restructured Hospitals,014-001-095-075-001,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"  Just one last one.

If today, we increase the intake, it will be a couple of years down the road before we see the effects in the wards.",1,17,014-001-095-075-001-017,17
2022-11-09,Length of Service of Foreign Nurses Employed at Restructured Hospitals,014-001-095-075-001,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,"So, the fastest way to alleviate the problem is perhaps to see whether we can increase the hiring of foreign nurses. In a few weeks, a few months, we could hire a huge number that will help to alleviate the current problem. That is why I keep pushing for information on what is MOH's expected number of foreign nurses that we are hoping to hire and how we are hoping to reach that. Minister Ong Ye Kung shared yesterday some of the countries we are looking at.",2,18,014-001-095-075-001-018,18

2022-11-09,Length of Service of Foreign Nurses Employed at Restructured Hospitals,014-001-095-075-001,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,  I understand the concerns. We have had a lot of extensive debates. The Member has filed a lot of questions on this matter. I have also repeatedly explained what our approach is.,1,20,014-001-095-075-001-020,20
2022-11-09,Length of Service of Foreign Nurses Employed at Restructured Hospitals,014-001-095-075-001,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"We are taking a multi-pronged approach. We are clearly speeding up our efforts. We have given an indication of timing, which is by 2030, to have 82,000 in total. We are looking at the specific avenues and different avenues. I also hope that the Member could assist to explain to some of the nurses whom he is in touch with, who are concerned about this situation, that we are doing whatever is necessary to retain the nurses who are within our healthcare system right now; we are doing what we can to increase the numbers.",2,21,014-001-095-075-001-021,21
2022-11-09,Length of Service of Foreign Nurses Employed at Restructured Hospitals,014-001-095-075-001,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"That is the more important focus, rather than talk about just the shortfall. Because we are talking about different avenues and different things have to change over time. We need to adjust because what is important to us is that we meet the demands, we address the current concerns that the healthcare sector is facing right now. So, we will do whatever it takes in the different aspects – increasing the intake from the local workforce, as well as to increase our recruitment. That is something the Member is quite familiar with.",3,22,014-001-095-075-001-022,22

2022-11-09,Length of Service of Foreign Nurses Employed at Restructured Hospitals,014-001-095-075-001,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"  Deputy Speaker, I think I am repeating myself ad nauseum.

2022-11-09,Length of Service of Foreign Nurses Employed at Restructured Hospitals,014-001-095-075-001,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"As I have explained, we have a target of 82,000 of all workers – nurses, allied health as well as all the other necessary workers in the healthcare sector. We have already set the target by 2030 because we are working towards Healthier SG. This number is in different categories and what is important for us is that we address the demands, the needs of the sector as well as the needs of the community.",2,26,014-001-095-075-001-026,26
2022-11-09,Length of Service of Foreign Nurses Employed at Restructured Hospitals,014-001-095-075-001,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"We have already explained in many of those questions that were put earlier, the different ways in which we are doing this. We are recruiting from overseas, we are improving the well-being of the nurses here, we are improving the career pathways, we are supporting them with the different job redesigns to facilitate their workflow. These are the various efforts. I hope that Members can also support us by assuring the healthcare workers that this is a matter that is very close to the heart of the Ministry. We have been engaging extensively with the clusters, we have been engaging extensively with the healthcare workers and trying to give them some respite.",3,27,014-001-095-075-001-027,27

Conducted in native languages, the SIP educates MWs comprehensively on their employment rights, support channels, as well as on lawful and responsible behaviour, including the law against unlawful assembly or procession in public places.",1,2,014-001-095-075-002-002,30

MOM has developed a comprehensive MW guide, monthly newsletters as well as various infographics in native languages on topics, such as salary payment and channels to seek help. MOM and its partners also routinely disseminate information through online and physical platforms, for example, FWMOMCare application, social media posts, roadshows as well as events, to remind MWs of their employment rights and encourage those with employment issues to seek help from MOM and the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) for salary claims.",2,3,014-001-095-075-002-003,31

These are volunteers at the dormitories. Or they can also inform MOM through the monthly salary survey on the FWMOMCare app. The majority of MWs are registered users of the app. Unions and NGOs, such as the Migrant Workers’ Centre which operates a hotline, are another source of support for MWs and can advise MWs on the avenues of help and work with MOM to render the necessary assistance to MWs.",3,4,014-001-095-075-002-004,32

2022-11-09,Educating Foreign Workers on Available Channels to Settle Wage Disputes and Laws against Illegal Assembly,014-001-095-075-002,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"  Thank you. Sir, I am concerned that foreign workers choose to make public their personal grievances or disputes with the companies because of non-payment of their salaries. Whilst I am sympathetic towards their concern, may I ask the Senior Minister of State whether MOM would be working with MHA to take action against companies that fail to pay the salaries and also the workers who choose to take the law into their own hands and make public protests? Would MOM be working with the Police to prosecute such workers?",1,8,014-001-095-075-002-008,36
2022-11-09,Educating Foreign Workers on Available Channels to Settle Wage Disputes and Laws against Illegal Assembly,014-001-095-075-002,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"  I gather that the Member is referring to the recent incident on 18 October 2022. Specific to the incident, I am unable to give too much detail as the Police investigations are still ongoing. What I will say is this  pertaining to salary claims, we take a very strong view and a strong principle that when a worker is owed salary, he must be paid. That is quite clear.",1,9,014-001-095-075-002-009,37
2022-11-09,Educating Foreign Workers on Available Channels to Settle Wage Disputes and Laws against Illegal Assembly,014-001-095-075-002,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"Of the 10 workers that were involved in the incident, five of them had salary claims. The other five and the rest of the employees in Zhengda Corporation actually have no salary claims. They are all okay and they were not owed any salary payments.

2022-11-09,Educating Foreign Workers on Available Channels to Settle Wage Disputes and Laws against Illegal Assembly,014-001-095-075-002,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"For those who were owed salary payments, we have assisted them to settle all the payments. So, that has been settled, once they come to MOM and we tried to mediate. But, in fact, we go one step further. In this case, we also investigated their main contractor – because these are subcontractors servicing the main contractor. We found that the main contractor, Shanghai Chong Kee, owed salary payments to 268 MWs. So, we moved upstream and found out about that and we have been assisting the workers. As at 31 October, Shanghai Chong Kee had settled the owed payments and we are working with them on the payment schedule for the rest.",3,11,014-001-095-075-002-011,39
2022-11-09,Educating Foreign Workers on Available Channels to Settle Wage Disputes and Laws against Illegal Assembly,014-001-095-075-002,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"So, it is not that the employer had deliberately held back the payments but we understand that during these challenging times, sometimes, payments are delayed. I think we all know the challenges the construction sector is facing. So, we try to mediate and see how we can best come to a middle ground and settle. If we push too hard, the company folds and it is not good for the workers, too.",4,12,014-001-095-075-002-012,40

2022-11-09,Educating Foreign Workers on Available Channels to Settle Wage Disputes and Laws against Illegal Assembly,014-001-095-075-002,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,"  I thank the Member for his question. Since April 2020, when we had the circuit breaker and we made the commitment that all workers were going to be paid, we introduced a requirement for all employers to pay salary electronically for their MWs, especially those who are residing in dormitories. Today, I would say that almost all employers are already doing so. And this is up from 75%, pre-COVID-19.

2022-11-09,Subsidies and Accreditation for Singapore International Schools Sited Outside Singapore,014-001-095-075-008,Ms Gan Siow Huang,  The Singapore International School in Hong Kong was set up in the 1990s at a time when there were many Singaporean adults who were working in Hong Kong with a sizeable number of children who wanted to have a Singapore-style and Singapore curriculum type of education there. MOE then extended assistance to the community in Hong Kong so that this would ease the Singaporean students' integration into our education system when they return to Singapore.,1,8,014-001-095-075-008-008,164

Secondly, not all parents want a Singapore-style and Singapore curriculum type of education for their children. A lot of the consideration is driven by the demand from the parents. And, of course, we also consider the resources needed, the resources in terms of educators as well as funding, that have to be made available to these international schools.",2,9,014-001-095-075-008-009,165

2022-11-09,"Reports on and Penalties for Employers who Make CPF Contributions to ""Phantom Workers""",014-001-095-075-012,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"When firms engage phantom workers or illegally recover costs from their foreign employees, they artificially inflate their firms' foreign worker quota and make foreigners cheaper to hire. This puts lower-income Singaporeans at a severe disadvantage, both in terms of landing jobs and bargaining for better salaries, and there is little incentive for workers to report this because they risk having their Work Permits cancelled. As a result, many of such offences may go undetected and unreported. So, my question is  can the Ministry conduct victimisation surveys of both local and foreign workers and employ more sophisticated intelligence gathering techniques to obtain a clearer picture of the extent of the problem and catch these offenders?",2,7,014-001-095-075-012-007,225

This number of 11 seems very low, compared to the extent of the problem that is out there. Is there a reason for this gap between 660 and 11?

The complainants may not have the full facts, which are only surfaced upon investigation by MOM. We have to be fair to employers, too. So, we have to go deep into the facts and find evidence before we can take actions against employers. A complainant who sees a shop full of foreigners may not be aware that there are actually locals working backend or offsite. In such cases, there is no infringement committed and no enforcement action taken.

I believe this was from the documentary, ""The Social Dilemma"", which, if you have not seen it on Netflix, I would recommend all Members of the House to watch as a very sobering insight into how social media works. Jaron Lainer says  “We’ve created a world in which online connection has become primary, especially for younger generations. And yet, in that world, anytime two people connect, the only way it’s financed is through a sneaky third person who’s paying to manipulate those two people. So, we’ve created an entire global generation of people who were raised within a context with the very meaning of communication, the very meaning of culture, is manipulation.”",20,22,014-001-095-075-016-022,277

For example, when Telegram groups have been found to distribute obscene images of women, administrators were charged under the Penal Code, including with distributing obscene material and facilitating the provision of sexual services. Has the Government considered streamlining all online-related harms into the Online Safety Bill, rather than relying on sections in the Penal Code and Protection from Harassment Act, placing a burden on victims to show that harm has, indeed, been inflicted?

A 2021 systematic review, which studied the impact of fake news on social media and its influence on health during the COVID-19 pandemic, found that social media platforms have contributed to the infodemic, which can perpetuate fake news and information.

2022-11-09,Online Safety (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill,014-001-095-075-016,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"Firstly, section 45H directs the online communication services (OCS) provider to disable access by Singapore users to egregious content. May I ask whether there is a specified amount of time the OCS would have to disable the content? Certain content may be more harmful and may need to be disabled immediately to mitigate the damage. One case in point is the Christchurch Attack in 2019. Using a GoPro camera, the attacker filmed himself using Facebook Live, gunning down 51 people in two mosques. The video quickly went viral and was viewed about 4,000 times before it was removed. As Washington Post reporter Drew Harwell summed up in a tweet, ""The New Zealand massacre was livestreamed on Facebook, announced on 8chan, reposted on YouTube, commented about on Reddit and mirrored around the world before the tech companies could even react.""",8,68,014-001-095-075-016-068,323
2022-11-09,Online Safety (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill,014-001-095-075-016,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"Secondly, if the OCS fails to comply with IMDA's direction to disable access or is unable to do it within a specified time, under section 45I, Internet service providers (ISPs) can be directed to block Singapore users' access to the OCS. Could the Minister clarify how long the OCS is expected to be blocked in such cases and what factors are used to determine the length of time?",9,69,014-001-095-075-016-069,324
2022-11-09,Online Safety (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill,014-001-095-075-016,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"Thirdly, I would also like to seek some clarity on who would be designated a regulated online communication (ROC) provider. Although section 45K(1) sets out some criteria, they are factors that do not bind IMDA and are actually quite wide. For example, how will IMDA quantify or measure ""the extent and nature of the effect that different types of OCS have on the people of Singapore""?",10,70,014-001-095-075-016-070,325
2022-11-09,Online Safety (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill,014-001-095-075-016,Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member),"Fourthly, section 45L sets out the boundaries of IMDA's powers in the code of practice. However, it is not clear how IMDA intends to implement the different objectives under section 45L. Could I seek clarification regarding the type of measures that may be introduced by IMDA under the code of practice? For example, how does IMDA intend to have OCS prevent children of different age groups access content that presents a material risk of significant harm to them? Most already have terms and conditions that require users to declare they are above a certain age. If a child user declares falsely, will OCS be liable for the child’s actions? If an OCS sets out community terms that explicitly prohibit egregious content but a user posts such content, will OCS be liable for the publishing of such content? What safeguards are there to ensure the audits requested by IMDA are not excessive?",11,71,014-001-095-075-016-071,326

The constant exposure to disturbing and inappropriate content takes a toll on their well-being. In 2019, Cambridge Consultants reported that ""moderating harmful content can cause significant psychological damage to moderators. The psychological effects of viewing harmful content is well documented, with reports of moderators experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and other mental health issues as a result of the disturbing content that they are exposed to."" May I suggest, therefore, that we also make it a part of the code of practice to protect our protectors – the content moderators who risk personal wellness for social good?",13,73,014-001-095-075-016-073,328

Today, social media platforms are not merely a conduit through which people interact with one another, but they serve as an extension of an individual's being, a representation of who they are and what they stand for. Given how much our digital spaces shape our physical realities, the formation of online communities and groups mirrors the physical society we live in and, therefore, the actions we take and the information we read online bear no less significance than those we do in person and in print.",1,79,014-001-095-075-016-079,334

2022-11-09,Online Safety (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill,014-001-095-075-016,Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"First, greater transparency. Behind the personalised content that we see on our social media accounts, there exist complex algorithms with various inputs and metrics that determine what is recommended to us.

To successfully build a safe online environment, it is imperative that users are well-educated on what constitutes harmful conduct and content, and it is my hope that the new measures fulfil this need.

While the amendment primarily focuses on specific egregious content that includes posts advocating suicide, self-harm, terrorism, sexual exploitation and other material that risk damaging our social fabric, these are not the only issues that constitute online harm. If we recognise that our online society is very much an extension of the physical society we share in, then we, as a country, should strive to regulate our social media just as we would our physical reality. This is especially important for native issues that arise specifically from the use of social media. Specifically, in the realm of their public and private posts, and their platform's direct messaging services on issues, such as cyberbullying, doxxing, or even revenge porn.",6,84,014-001-095-075-016-084,339

As a victim of doxxing, she had her personal details – her name, school, employer, amongst other things – revealed online against her desire by an anonymous account. When she attempted to remove the post and sought recourse from the social media platform, the lack of urgency in dealing with the matter exacerbated the already extreme levels of vulnerability and fear she experienced, knowing that every extra second the post was allowed to remain online was another opportunity for a vile user to re-victimise her.

I received an acknowledgement note almost immediately from the platform saying that they had received the report and that they would use their community guidelines to review the account. It was not until four days later that I received a note from the social media platform saying this, ""We didn’t remove xxx account. Because of the high volume of reports we receive, our team hasn’t been able to review this account. Bullying and harassment are not okay and are against our community guidelines. There are a few things you can do to avoid seeing accounts you find upsetting.

It is, therefore, heartening to see the call for greater transparency surrounding the decision-making processes of social media platforms, along with the tools, resources and enforcement options available to them. With greater clarity, users are better informed and well-assured about how social media platforms can support them upon experiencing online harm. Yet, these measures do not fully grasp the emotional and mental turbulence that one experiences as a victim of online harm. The apparent lack of a human touch in the process of dealing with online harm by social media platforms reflects a certain degree of uncongeniality and coldness that does not work to protect and support victims in times of need, and perhaps should be re-evaluated.",13,91,014-001-095-075-016-091,346

Social media platforms must ""minimise users' exposure"" to such content. In the final version of the Code, will IMDA provide more specific category names, detailed explanations for each category or sub-categories for exclusion?

But many other companies also use user-generated content. For example, e-commerce platforms may rely on user reviews and comments. Online games, as I shared earlier, may have extensive user interaction.

Social Media Services (SMS) are listed as a type of OCS. Under the Bill, SMS will need to implement measures to limit local users' exposure to harmful content, thus forcing OCS to be more accountable to users.

With respect to safeguarding children from online harms, rather than tackling this issue primarily from the legislature, robust and comprehensive education programmes should be in place to complement these policies. I am particularly heartened to see that MOE's Character and Citizenship Education syllabus includes ""cyber wellness"". As part of the syllabus, students learn about navigating cyberspace.

The reality is that not all parents are equipped or prepared to have such conversations in a helpful, supportive or productive manner. Children, and even adults, can be severely traumatised by explicit content and hateful language. When trauma is left unaddressed and repressed, it can manifest itself in unhealthy ways. In the code proposed for designated SMS, I would like to propose that tools that allow children and parents to manage online safety and directions to where to seek help if exposed to harmful or inappropriate material be made available.",6,133,014-001-095-075-016-133,388

And while this Bill is not intended to address gaming, perhaps the Ministry can engage the e-sports and gaming community and consider similar protections for players and gamers in the future. Today, the industry is already recognising toxicity as a problem and some major gaming companies have taken initiatives to launch their own anti-toxicity programmes, but with little success.",8,135,014-001-095-075-016-135,390

Storylines and game themes can also depict disagreeable messages and social behaviours. With Big Tech firms investing heavily in the metaverse, we can expect more pervasive, more immersive technology and experiences very soon in our everyday lives. Clearly stated age ratings, warnings and age restrictions are already in place. But are these enough? Can we better protect children from exposure to sexualisation and violence?

They are a commonplace in game design and architecture. They create an element of chance and reward which, in turn, creates a stickiness to the game.

I agree with the Minister that the Internet and technology are changing rapidly and as we debate about the Online Safety Bill in the context of SMS today, we can plan for legislation on gaming in the future. We should keep the conversation going. In fact, we should speak openly about gaming and how to game responsibly.

2022-11-09,Online Safety (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill,014-001-095-075-016,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Actually, I would argue that legislation has become necessary because the OCS providers have failed to properly self-regulate and remove harmful content from being posted on their platforms. Today, many, if not all, OCS providers have a robust algorithm that removes copyrighted content almost instantaneously. The technology to remove content automatically and fast already exists and I hope that the social media sites can channel this technology beyond policing copyrighted content and focus also on what is deemed as socially harmful content.",5,145,014-001-095-075-016-145,400

Pornography is often embedded in these games and many games do glorify violence and sexual exploitation. In fact, a quick online search will surface many stories about how violence towards women is encouraged amongst gamers who hide under the cover of anonymity. For example, in the game ""The Sims Online"", a ""cyber-brothel"" was developed by a 17-year-old boy using the game alias ""Evangeline"" and customers paid sim-money for cybersex by the minute.

If you take into account users who access online social media platforms using their mobile device, the Internet penetration rate goes up higher from 89.5% to around 90%. The age of such users is also getting younger and younger.

As observers, we can sympathise, we can lament; but I think, as parents, it is an experience that no one of us, no child, no family, should have to go through or endure.",19,210,014-001-095-075-016-210,465

I foresee the challenges that the changes to the metaverse would pose to society and to the Ministry in policing it and helping to keep all of us safe. I do hope that the Ministry will be able to muster sufficient manpower resources to quickly ensure that the safeguards spelt out in this Bill are as good in words as they are in action. Our children, especially, need us to take the right decisions to keep them safe. We owe them and others our responsibility.

At the coroner's inquest, they found that the harmful content Molly encountered on social media had played a contributing role in her suicide. Coroner Andrew Walker said images of self-harm and suicide she viewed ""shouldn't have been available for a child to see"".

2022-11-09,Online Safety (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill,014-001-095-075-016,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"The Bill and the code rightfully prescribe additional obligations to be undertaken by these services to prevent minors from accessing harmful content.

With this, the services can then moderate the content shown to minors.",10,222,014-001-095-075-016-222,477

Could the Ministry elaborate on whether it would consider implementing an objective or specific timeframe for the services to respond to user reports and perhaps have different timeframes which are proportionate to the nature of the harmful content identified? For example, the timeframe for services to respond to sexual cyberbullying content should arguably be done as soon as possible.",17,229,014-001-095-075-016-229,484

The Bill sets out a list of factors that must be considered collectively. For example, it may be possible to conclude that a social media group is public, even if that social media group has been set to “private” and requires the owner to grant permission before one can access the content, but the owner is indiscriminate in granting that access.

Our approach has been to identify and address specific areas of harm in a targeted manner. As to whether the laws will be consolidated later, that remains to be seen. At this time, it is more important that we put in place legislation that effectively addresses and combats the respective harms. For example, at the Committee of Supply debates this year, MHA announced that it was studying potential levers to deal with criminal offences committed online. Work is in progress.

This has grave implications. There is no incentive for unregulated accountants to continuously upskill or adhere to ethical requirements as they are not required to comply with continuous professional development requirements and are not answerable for misconduct or any forms of discredit to the accountancy profession. For instance, unregulated accountants who are not kept abreast of the anti-money laundering regulations and sanctions may be susceptible to being used by money launderers as they may not be aware of the latest money laundering methods and trends.",18,48,014-001-095-075-017-048,643

Generally, ACRA has the right to conduct a review of the actions taken by DE against the CA, under section 35G of the Act, upon being informed by DE of its investigation undertaken.

In practice, ACRA will review the relevant materials in the proceedings that the DE has previously undertaken, which will, typically, include the explanation given by the CA before arriving at the preliminary view of an intended revocation or suspension.

Currently, these spaces have looked into providing mental health screening and support for youth with mental health issues and operating a strength training gym for the seniors.

In addition, with the relaxation of COVID-19 measures and the resumption of travel, the demand for private buses has returned.

That said, even if multiple and staggered trips were made, the demand for buses and, hence, drivers would still be significant and difficult to meet.
