2014-09-09,Rationale for Vehicle Entry Permit Fees for Foreign-registered Cars,012-002-092-013-001,Mr Ang Wei Neng,asked,1,1,012-002-092-013-001-001,1
2014-09-09,Rationale for Vehicle Entry Permit Fees for Foreign-registered Cars,012-002-092-013-001,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"  Mdm Speaker, our Vehicle Entry Permit (VEP) fee and the Goods Vehicle Permit (GVP) fee seek to equalise the cost of owning and using a foreign-registered vehicle in Singapore, with that for a Singapore-registered vehicle. There is a need to do so, given the significantly higher costs for Singapore-registered vehicles because of our Certificate of Entitlement (COE) policy, higher vehicle taxes and so on. By way of background, the GVP has been in existence since the 1960s, and the VEP since the 1970s.",1,2,012-002-092-013-001-002,2
2014-09-09,Rationale for Vehicle Entry Permit Fees for Foreign-registered Cars,012-002-092-013-001,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"LTA periodically reviews these fees to ensure that they continue to serve their objective. The cost difference between owning and using a foreign-registered vehicle and a Singapore-registered vehicle has widened in recent years. This is why we need to revise the fees. I should point out that this is the first increase in the VEP fee in 20 years, the last being in 1994. The VEP is not always adjusted upwards. In fact, it was reduced in 2004 for foreign-registered cars because COE prices had gone down during that period, resulting in lower overall costs for Singapore-registered cars. The GVP fee had remained unchanged since its introduction until the recent revision.",2,3,012-002-092-013-001-003,3
2014-09-09,Rationale for Vehicle Entry Permit Fees for Foreign-registered Cars,012-002-092-013-001,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"Buses, taxis and motorcycles are not affected by the recent increase in VEP and GVP fees. In addition, all foreign-registered cars and motorcycles continue to enjoy around 125 VEP-free days per year, on top of daily VEP-free hours which are from 5.00 pm to 2.00 am, and which is extended to 12.00 pm to 2.00 am during Singapore's mid-year and year-end school holidays. Effectively, based on 2013 data, only about one in 10 foreign-registered cars that enter Singapore will be affected by the recent increase in VEP fee.",3,4,012-002-092-013-001-004,4
2014-09-09,Rationale for Vehicle Entry Permit Fees for Foreign-registered Cars,012-002-092-013-001,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"The VEP is not intended as a revenue generator. The VEP fees collected vary, depending on the number of foreign-registered cars and motorcycles entering Singapore and their length of stay during VEP-chargeable hours.",4,5,012-002-092-013-001-005,5
2014-09-09,Rationale for Vehicle Entry Permit Fees for Foreign-registered Cars,012-002-092-013-001,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"On Malaysia's proposed entry fee on non-Malaysia-registered vehicles entering Johor, we have not been officially informed of it by the Malaysian government. We are concerned whether it is directed towards Singapore vehicles. We have contacted the Malaysian government to seek details and are awaiting their reply before deciding on our response.",5,6,012-002-092-013-001-006,6
2014-09-09,Rationale for Vehicle Entry Permit Fees for Foreign-registered Cars,012-002-092-013-001,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"  Mdm Speaker, I thank the Senior Minister of State for the comprehensive reply. We understand that the purpose of the VEP is to curb vehicle congestion during the peak hours and typically during the week days. Foreign-registered vehicles entering Singapore are given 10 VEP-free days per calendar year, besides not having to pay VEP during Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays. If the Malaysian authorities had decided to go ahead with their own VEP, would MOT consider negotiating with them so as to provide the same kind of number of fee-free days?",1,7,012-002-092-013-001-007,7
2014-09-09,Rationale for Vehicle Entry Permit Fees for Foreign-registered Cars,012-002-092-013-001,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"My second supplementary question is about the higher toll charges imposed by Malaysia at the Causeway since 1 August 2014. Both MOT and LTA have indicated the intention for Singapore to match the same. However, many Singaporeans are concerned about the impact of the higher toll charges. Would the Senior Minister of State provide an update on this issue?",2,8,012-002-092-013-001-008,8
2014-09-09,Rationale for Vehicle Entry Permit Fees for Foreign-registered Cars,012-002-092-013-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,"  As I had noted earlier in our response, we have not had official word from the Malaysian government on what they intend to do regarding the entry permit fees that reportedly they would like to levy. Until details are made known to us, it is premature to comment on it. So, I would suggest that we not say anything more at this point in time.",1,9,012-002-092-013-001-009,9
2014-09-09,Rationale for Vehicle Entry Permit Fees for Foreign-registered Cars,012-002-092-013-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Regarding the Causeway tolls, there is a Parliamentary Question (PQ) following this first PQ that relates to the Causeway toll, so I suggest we take it together with Question No 2.",2,10,012-002-092-013-001-010,10
2014-09-09,Matching Toll Charges at Causeway and Second Link,012-002-092-013-002,Mr Pritam Singh,asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA plans to review its long-standing policy of matching toll charges at the Causeway and Second Link to those set by Malaysia in future; and (b) whether a Whole-of-Government study has been carried out by Singapore to assess the prospect of higher toll charges on Singapore businesses operating in the Iskandar zone in Johor.,1,1,012-002-092-013-002-001,11

2014-09-09,Matching Toll Charges at Causeway and Second Link,012-002-092-013-002,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"  Mdm Speaker, toll charges at the Causeway and Second Link were introduced by Malaysia in 1998. Our matching policy reflects the shared nature of the two crossings, and ensures a fair distribution of total revenues from the crossings. Without a matching policy, lower toll charges by one side may simply be offset by higher tolls levied by the other side. There is no assurance that toll charges foregone by one side will be translated into lower total charges which benefit motorists.",1,3,012-002-092-013-002-003,13
2014-09-09,Matching Toll Charges at Causeway and Second Link,012-002-092-013-002,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"Hence, in response to Malaysia's Causeway tolls revision on 1 August 2014, we have announced Singapore's intention to match Malaysia's new and increased toll charges in due course.",2,4,012-002-092-013-002-004,14

But clearly, there will be some impact on their costs.",3,5,012-002-092-013-002-005,15
2014-09-09,Matching Toll Charges at Causeway and Second Link,012-002-092-013-002,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Transport),"In this regard, we note reports in the Malaysian media that the Malaysian authorities will review the tolls. Should Malaysia reduce or do away with the toll charges, Singapore will follow suit. This would be welcomed, I think, by both Singapore and Malaysia businesses on both sides of the Causeway.",4,6,012-002-092-013-002-006,16
2014-09-09,Matching Toll Charges at Causeway and Second Link,012-002-092-013-002,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"  Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State for that very helpful clarification. I have three supplementary questions for the Senior Minister of State. First, did the Malaysian government forewarn Singapore of their intention to raise toll charges at the Causeway on 1 August, and have there been any joint discussions about this round of toll hikes since 1 August so as to manage costs for Singaporeans and Malaysians travelling to and fro both countries?",1,7,012-002-092-013-002-007,17
2014-09-09,Matching Toll Charges at Causeway and Second Link,012-002-092-013-002,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The second question is  did the Singapore Government inform its Malaysian counterparts when it planned to increase VEP charges in July this year, and if not, does it plan to do so going forward?",2,8,012-002-092-013-002-008,18
2014-09-09,Matching Toll Charges at Causeway and Second Link,012-002-092-013-002,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Finally, in view of the close relationship between Singapore and Malaysia, especially between the Prime Ministers in recent years, has the Government suggested to the Malaysian authorities to consider tagging the additional toll from 1 August along the Eastern Dispersal Link rather than at the Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ), so as not to penalise drivers who do not use the Eastern Dispersal Link and only travel into Johor Bahru city?",3,9,012-002-092-013-002-009,19
2014-09-09,Matching Toll Charges at Causeway and Second Link,012-002-092-013-002,Mrs Josephine Teo,"  Mdm Speaker, the answer to the Member's first question is no. We were not informed in advance of Malaysia's intention to increase the tolls at the Causeway on 1 August. The answer to his second question is yes. We informed our Malaysian counterparts in advance why there is a need to revise the VEP fees. As I have explained in my answer to the earlier Parliamentary Question on VEP fees, it is really because the cost of owning a Singapore-registered vehicle and using it on Singapore roads has risen, whereas the similar cost for a foreign-registered vehicle had largely remained unchanged. And so, yes, our Malaysian counterparts were aware of the intention to raise our VEP fees.",1,10,012-002-092-013-002-010,20
2014-09-09,Matching Toll Charges at Causeway and Second Link,012-002-092-013-002,Mrs Josephine Teo,"We very much would like our Malaysian counterparts to come to the discussion table and look at what are the better ways of managing this issue of the Causeway tolls so as not to penalise drivers who do not use the Eastern Dispersal Link. Our long-standing policy is well known to our Malaysian counterparts, and that means if the Causeway tolls levied by the Malaysian side were to be reduced or removed, we would do likewise.",2,11,012-002-092-013-002-011,21
2014-09-09,Clinical Trials for Sanofi Dengue Vaccine,012-002-092-013-003,Mr Christopher de Souza,"asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there are clinical trial runs for the Sanofi dengue vaccine being conducted in Singapore; (b) whether an approved dengue vaccine can be used to help reduce the number of people who suffer from dengue fever in Singapore; and (c) whether the Ministry has plans to eventually make a dengue vaccine available under the National Childhood Immunisation Programme (NCIP), just like the polio vaccine.",1,1,012-002-092-013-003-001,22

2014-09-09,Clinical Trials for Sanofi Dengue Vaccine,012-002-092-013-003,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim),"A dengue vaccine could potentially help reduce the number of cases of dengue in Singapore. However, it is too early to definitively assess the effects of the Sanofi dengue vaccine. As with all new vaccines, it must first be scientifically assessed by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) for its safety, quality and efficacy to meet internationally benchmarked standards, before the vaccine is approved for use in Singapore. In granting marketing approval, HSA will take into account whether the data provided from the clinical trial studies demonstrates that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks of potential side effects, if any.",2,3,012-002-092-013-003-003,24
2014-09-09,Clinical Trials for Sanofi Dengue Vaccine,012-002-092-013-003,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim),"Results from two large scale Phase III studies, conducted in Asia and South America, were reported recently. Both studies focused on effectiveness of the vaccine in children, whereas in Singapore, most dengue cases occur in adults. The results were similar and showed lower efficacy against dengue virus serotypes 1 and 2, which are the commonest types circulating in Singapore. There had previously been reports that while past infection with one serotype confers immunity and protection against that serotype, it could lead to more serious disease if infection with a different serotype occurs.",3,4,012-002-092-013-003-004,25
2014-09-09,Clinical Trials for Sanofi Dengue Vaccine,012-002-092-013-003,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim),"More study is needed to ascertain whether similarly, incomplete protection from vaccination could potentially result in the risk of more severe infection from serotypes which the vaccine protects poorly against. To reduce the number of dengue cases, other measures such as reducing the number of mosquito breeding sites and using mosquito repellents continue to play an important part.",4,5,012-002-092-013-003-005,26

The ECI considers factors such as the local burden of disease, vaccine safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness when recommending whether a particular vaccine, such as the dengue vaccine when it becomes available, should be included into the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule.",5,6,012-002-092-013-003-006,27

The Member has asked about extra shows. Let me just give some details on our current format. There are now four shows open prior to the actual NDP – three National Education Shows for school students and the NDP Preview itself. The Member has suggested and asked if another NDP Preview would be one way of increasing the attendance. We can explore the idea but adding another NDP Preview may tax participants too heavily, who would require some rest before the actual NDP Show.",2,3,012-002-092-013-004-003,30

And thirdly, the NDP Preview, whether we could consider one more of this preview because the capacity at the Padang is usually much less and perhaps, we can see if we can have one less rehearsal in the earlier stages so that we can have one more Preview for the public to view.",2,6,012-002-092-013-004-006,33

I am glad that the Member has brought it up. It shows that the Organising Committee is on the right track. They have looked around the area. There are possible focal points.

I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. From the many cases I have seen in my Meet-the-People Sessions (MPS) and house visits, many seniors aged 55 and above were pretty upset that the GST Voucher is based on the Annual Valuation of their residence, because most of them do not own a property. They are cash-poor, but simply because they live with their children, they are denied the benefits.

I would like to ask the Minister, based on the conversations that I have with some of the pre-school teachers within my constituency, they shared that there has been a move to encourage them to take on graduate degree kind of programmes and this has asserted quite a bit of pressure on them. I am wondering if the Minister could clarify whether this move is actually signalling that the pre-school sector should be moving into a higher skill, higher knowledge kind of basis whereby pre-school teachers are expected, moving ahead, to hold a degree before they can dispense proper care for our toddlers or young children. Could the Minister help to address this question?",1,4,012-002-092-013-007-004,56

As what we mentioned, what we want is to have people who are appropriately trained, adequate for their jobs and not whether they have a degree or a diploma per se. In fact, today, the vast majority of early childhood educators do not need a degree to be in the sector. And I think we all know that what we are looking for in the early childhood sector are people who can relate to children, people who can care and have the heart for them. A degree may neither be necessary or sufficient in itself.

The first thing, as Members will know, is that we recently introduced a registration management system. This gives us a better fix of who are the people who are really in the queue or demand. And what we have discovered, very quickly, is that the real or actual demand is a fraction of what the queue may have represented in the past. For those operators who have come on board with us, they are able to deconflict the people who have either got a place somewhere else but never informed them and they should be out of the queue, or there are people who are queuing at multiple centres, sometimes more than 10 centres, and that messes up the projection demand.",2,8,012-002-092-013-008-008,66
2014-09-09,Availability of Qualified Infant Care Personnel,012-002-092-013-008,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"So, the first thing we want to do better is for the registration management system to get a better queue system in place, to know the actual demand. That will allow the operators to better site their operations to where it is required. So, that is the first thing – right numbers. The second thing that we want to do better is to make sure that the planning of places in each level is correct. Because while the total number of places is one thing that we are concerned with, we are also concerned with the number of places in each level – whether it is N1, N2, infant care, and so forth, so that there can be better matching. The third thing is a better siting of the location. Some of the high demand areas, like Nee Soon South, Punggol and Woodlands, are where we have allowed the Anchor Operators to quickly expand capacity.",3,9,012-002-092-013-008-009,67

2014-09-09,Availability of Qualified Infant Care Personnel,012-002-092-013-008,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"On the supply side, we are also doing four things to make sure that we increase the supply to meet the demand. First, we want to make sure that we strengthen the process of recruitment upstream. We are giving out more scholarships and more training awards, and these will strengthen the pipeline of people coming through to the sector. Second, what we are going to do is to review the career pathways and progression for people to find it attractive and professionally challenging to stay in the sector. Third, we want to make sure that in terms of retention of manpower, we will be able to stretch the career of the early childhood professionals so that we reduce the churn in the sector and also to reduce the training resources we need to pump into this sector. And the last thing is getting the sites right. So, we have placed a lot of emphasis on areas with a larger population of younger families, for example, Woodlands, Punggol, Pasir Ris, Sengkang, and some parts of Yishun Town itself.

In this sector, we will have to work very closely with the operators in managing the supply and the demand of child care because this sector is operated by a number of Anchor Operators and many more private operators. So, we have to talk to operators to make sure that they work with us to provide the career opportunities for the teachers to be recruited in the sector and to stay in the sector.",7,13,012-002-092-013-008-013,71

And we have seen some innovative ideas from some other estates whereby they recruit part-timers and women who are hoping to return to work after bringing up their children. And these are auxiliary manpower that we can quickly get in to staff the centres. So, the availability of childcare places is not necessarily the bottleneck for Yishun. It is the recruitment of the educarers that are required and we welcome suggestions on how we can strengthen this pipeline, especially in a very labour-tight market.",8,14,012-002-092-013-008-014,72

Is there a high attrition rate for those who undergo the training programme but did not end up as pre-school teachers? My second question is about the traineeship programme for the early childhood sector. I think the Minister probably touched on this a little bit earlier, but I am wondering if a part-time scheme or flexi-adjunct scheme for stay-at-home mothers can be introduced under this traineeship programme, to encourage more stay-at-home mothers to come out and join the pre-school sectors as educarers or teachers.",1,16,012-002-092-013-008-016,74

We want to bring this down, which is why we are working closely with MOE and the ASPIRE Committee. The first thing we need to do better is to make sure that we counsel the people taking up early childhood care and development courses, that they must have a passion and they must be prepared to undertake the work in the sector. Like many other sectors in the Polytechnics or even in the ITE, there would be people who took up the courses but eventually did not take on the particular job there. I do not have the exact attrition rate but I know that it is much higher than what I would like it to be. I can get the numbers for the Member  subsequently. So, this is what we want to do – to reduce the attrition from the pipeline.

Recently, we started a scheme, which is to have a registry of all the people who have just left the sector or who have retired from the sector, for them to come back as part-timers to join us as and when they want. They not only provide a ready source of manpower, they also provide supplementary manpower for our own teachers in the sector to go for training.

I was told that for infant carers, they need to go through a certain duration of training. So, if you were to recruit some of those housewives who are very good in caring and have the experience in caring of babies, if you asked them to go and study, they would say, ""	Ai tak chek ah	,"" or ""we have to study?"", then they would not want to come forward.

For most trainees, we recruit them on what we call a place-and-train basis, that is, we recruit them, they show the correct aptitude, they show the skill sets and can give assurance to the parents that they are able to take care of the children, then we do the modularised training and upgrade them along the way.

Some issues in terms of safety, hygiene – these are fundamental aspects of training. And at the same time, educarers must have the heart to want to care for the children. So, they are not going to go for a lot of examinations and tests on the academic side, but more on practical skills that can help them.

I do not disagree with the principle of using financial disincentives to control traffic volume, and hence alleviate traffic congestion. However, I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State, has our consistent tweaking of ERP rates been confusing motorists on keeping track of and remembering the prevailing rate of a specific gantry during different time slots of the day and how effective has this scheme in addressing psychology of motorists and changing their driving behaviour? It is interesting, given that the high percentage of 78% of gantries had not changed their rate in the last three years, would this not indicate that the ERP had not helped to bring down the traffic volume across those gantries?",1,7,012-002-092-013-011-007,110
2014-09-09,Revisions to ERP Rates,012-002-092-013-011,Mrs Josephine Teo,"  Mdm Speaker, the ERP rates are changed when the speeds fall outside the optimal range. So, it is not an optimal speed, but it is a range. And the range is 45 km/h to 65 km/h on expressways. The reason why this is a range is so that you do not have to make ERP rate changes so frequently. Speeds have to go below 45 km/h for us to increase the rate. Speeds have to go beyond 65 km/h for us to bring down the rate. And that is precisely to address the Member's concern. We do not want to confuse the motorists too much.",1,8,012-002-092-013-011-008,111

Very often, we only pay attention when our in-vehicle unit goes ""beep"", we look at the number and realise that it looks different from the last time we were on the road.

When it is adjusted, we also make sure that the amount is significant enough for people to take notice in the hope that this will cause them to rethink their driving behaviour. Not all will respond because even with the rate changes, they may consider that it is still well worth the time savings for them. Alternatively, they may assess that they have no better alternative but to travel in that particular time slot. But each time there is a rate change, we do notice that there are certain drivers who have changed their travelling pattern, and that is why there has been an impact on the speeds of travel on the particular stretches of road where ERP rate changes have occurred.",3,10,012-002-092-013-011-010,113

Since the 1980s, older pipes have been systematically replaced with cement-lined ductile iron and steel mains, which are more durable and have an expected lifespan of 70 years. A strict maintenance regime is in place to ensure that our water pipes remain in good working condition.

I would also like to ask, for example, about water pipes. There are ground movements and as Members of Parliament, we do receive complaints from residents about water pipe leakages as well as bursting of pipes.

2014-09-09,Preventing Major Underground Gas Leaks,012-002-092-013-012,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"  Madam, in the Taiwanese case, the recent explosion is due to a pipeline supplying petrochemicals to a chemical plant. The gas carried there is propene (C3H6), which is different from the natural gas that our SPPG is distributing. Propene is a heavier gas than air. So, when it leaks, it tends to stay underground until it gathers a bigger mass, which makes it more dangerous. Whereas natural gas, in our case, is lighter. So, if it leaks, it tends to dissipate into the air quickly, therefore, reducing a volume build-up and explosion.",1,13,012-002-092-013-012-013,128

The results of the investigation in Taiwan have not been released, so, we probably can take some lessons from that incident at a later stage. In the case of Singapore, I mentioned SPPG being the one that manages our natural gas distribution pipelines on the mainland mostly, whereas our petrochemical pipelines are mostly concentrated on Jurong Island. And therefore, they are supervised by SCDF which imposes in them another and more stringent set of construction, operation and maintenance regime. We have confidence that the two sets of pipelines are separately managed, and there is sufficient rigour and robustness in the way that they are maintained and operated.",2,14,012-002-092-013-012-014,129

Perhaps, living in mature estates presents more difficulty for children to want to move in close to their parents. May I ask the Minister's clarification on this particular issue, where in a mature estate, for example, the constituency I serve, Ulu Pandan, there is limited space to build more flats. HDB is good at finding pockets of space and building flats, and children would move into those flats to be close to their parents. But the parents usually live in older flats which are possibly coming up for en bloc development. My question is, would HDB look at it in a considered fashion to try to find space even for the older flats to undergo en bloc within that mature estate setting? I know it may be a tall order, but I would be grateful if consideration could be given for that.",1,10,012-002-092-013-014-010,148
2014-09-09,Housing Grants for Married Children to Buy HDB Flats near Parents ,012-002-092-013-014,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"  Madam, indeed, it is a tall order. And for mature estates, there are particular challenges for the simple reason that land for a big number of BTO construction is less available than in non-mature estates. But because this is such an important social objective, we try very hard and we continue to strive to the best of our abilities to fulfil those needs. There are various ways we go about it. If the Member checked back on the last three years of BTO launches, he will note that I have launched quite a number in several mature estates. Within the next 12 months, there will be several BTO launches in several mature estates. Whether these would be in the Member's ward, I do not know, but wherever possible, we try to do so.",1,11,012-002-092-013-014-011,149

There is yet another avenue which is resale flat. There are a large number of resale flats, more so than the number of new flats that I can build. In fact, until this current property cycle, most people buy their flats through resale transactions – the ratio was about 60-40; 60% from resale and 40% from BTO flats.",2,12,012-002-092-013-014-012,150

In MND, we try very hard to meet the aspirations of both parents – especially parents – and their children wanting to be able to live close by and we will do our very best. Of course, there is, yet, another option which is the parents may decide to sell off their flats and move with their children to the new towns. Theoretically, it is logical and possible, but I know many parents are very reluctant. As we have heard yesterday, they are used to the hawkers, to a particular wet market stallholder and they find it very difficult to move to a new place.

2014-09-09,Window Grilles for HDB Rental Flats,012-002-092-013-015,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman," Madam, let me contextualise the availability of grilles in rental flats. Although I have mentioned that we do not put it as a standard feature today, historically, rental flats which were mainly built in the 1960s and 1970s were originally designed without window grilles. Tenants who wished to install it at that time can do so at their own cost. But over the years, as part of the Government's efforts to improve the living conditions of our rental flat tenants, window grilles were included as one of the improvement items and installed during the various upgrading programmes. For example – rental flats – the Main Upgrading Programme, the Project LIFE rental flats upgrading project.",1,10,012-002-092-013-015-010,168

However, some tenants also provide feedback that the window grilles caused a ""caged in"" kind of feeling in the smaller flats and hindered or obstructed some of their activities, for example, especially for the elderly ones, who have difficulties when they want to hang out their clothes. Therefore, HDB, after having upgraded some of these rental flats with window grilles, in 2007, we had a review and we decided to exclude window grilles as essential items for fitting in rental flats for the following reasons  one, is as mentioned, not all rental tenants need window grilles and it is consistent with the non-provision of grilles in purchase and rental flats, and at the same time, based on the feedback that we have received.",2,11,012-002-092-013-015-011,169

Conducting psychometric tests, such as the DISC personality assessment, will enable students to develop a better understanding of their attributes, the special qualities that they possess and an honest reflection of their own weaknesses. An in-depth awareness of oneself will enable him to better tailor his education with his career decisions.

Invitation to parents to attend ECG sessions at the Secondary school level should be seriously considered. In the report, it was stated that 62% and 49% of the Polytechnic and ITE students surveyed cited parents as one of their top three influences in choosing their course of study. Clearly, parents have a disproportionate influence on their child's mindset and thought processes. Thus, they need to be well-equipped to provide the necessary advice and opinions to their own child. In doing so, it would also provide parents with a realistic and rational perspective to their child's academic potential and their accompanying career opportunities.",12,110,012-002-092-013-018-110,296

This is to ensure that these graduates not only retain their skills and knowledge that they have gained but, at the same time, they would also gain practical experience and knowledge that are relevant to their course of study. The recommendation to give accreditation is also a good initiative. This effort is akin to the Malay saying ""while diving, you drink the water"" where many benefits can be gained while undergoing National Service.

The Manpower and Training Unit was established to focus on industrial training within Singapore. The Overseas Training Programme and Joint Government Training Centres saw many young Singaporean workers being placed in apprenticeship programmes in countries like India, Holland and Germany to learn and improve on their skills. In the marine industry, many young Singaporeans had to undergo on-the-job training and other training programmes to be groomed into skilled draftsmen, technicians and welders, more for the shipyards.

It is also important that we see that the improvisation and creation of new training programmes and the assistance that we are providing for our workers and our students, in partnership with companies, locally and globally, will result in a better system. This is all in aid of helping our youngsters to obtain useful, marketable skills for good employment and the right employer. It will help to improve the quality of our workforce and, in turn, our productivity for a sustainable economic growth that we want to achieve for the long term.

This is limiting because the highest qualifications will do a person no good if there are no good jobs available in the first place. And, indeed, in many parts of Europe, even nearer home – Taiwan and other examples – we see highly educated people without a job because the economy does not create jobs for them – for structural or cyclical reasons.

Some jobs require degrees, some jobs do not. Some, like heart surgeons, for instance, require deep skills that take years of postgraduate specialised training. And there are some jobs, like those of a master craftsman or master chef, that also require deep skills but which can be better acquired on the job.",9,161,012-002-092-013-018-161,347

2014-09-09,Applied Study in Polytechnics and Institute of Technical Education Review (ASPIRE),012-002-092-013-018,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"So, let me be clear. ASPIRE is not about dissuading Singaporeans from upgrading ourselves, or pursuing degrees, or pursuing any form of qualifications. ASPIRE is about creating opportunities for all, not creating more competition for some. ASPIRE is about keeping pathways open for all, not blocking pathways for some. Qualifications matter but they must be the right qualifications and of the right standard for what we want to do. For example, we want our doctors, nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists to each have the right qualification for the job they do. We want the engineers who certify that our buildings are safe, to be well-trained and well-qualified to do the job. We want our architects similarly to be well-qualified for the job.",12,164,012-002-092-013-018-164,350

But not all qualifications matter, not if they do not help us build the right skills for what we want to do. This can happen when we seek qualifications as a paper chase rather than as a quest for skills.",13,165,012-002-092-013-018-165,351

She shared that after she got her diploma, she went directly to do a private degree programme because she thought that she could get a better job and earn a better pay. But after spending tens of thousands of dollars on the programme, she now got a job that paid her at a fresh diploma holder level, about $2,000, because her company did not find her degree skills relevant. She lost three years of salary had she gone on to work, so an opportunity cost of over $70,000, plus the cost of doing this programme. What is worse is that she realised, after all this, that this line of work does not suit her strengths and interests. She was so caught up in chasing a piece of paper that she lost the chance to discover what she really cared about. Each person has a different learning and working journey. This story moved me because her family is not well off, but it is such a huge cost to them. It is only now, three years and a lot of costs later, that she is getting a good sense of what she really wants to do. Would it not have been so much better for her and her family if she could have realised this earlier?",14,166,012-002-092-013-018-166,352

She was very interested in communications and design. I asked her why she wanted to do a degree, and she said because it would allow her to do better. I was really impressed by this young lady. She was full of zest for learning and wanting to do well. I explored a number of options with her as to what her career interests were, what her passion was and what she enjoyed learning and doing most. And she told me that she is very keen to learn how to marry communications with design and with planning. And I said that is very good and, in fact, there a number of useful courses in our Polytechnics for doing that. Since I am an untrained career counsellor, I told her to send me a longer note on what she is really interested in doing and what her career plans are and I will get someone trained and well-versed in this industry to advise her.",16,168,012-002-092-013-018-168,354

Not to mention the architects and the engineers who designed all these attractions. Not to mention the technicians and the cleaners who maintain these facilities.

None of these breakthroughs limits opportunities for one group of people over another. It is not about one kind of qualification versus another, one group versus another.

The answer is yes. The Public Service Division is doing so. In MOE, we recognise that qualifications matter for teachers and we also recognise that some teachers who did not take the degree route can develop the depth of knowledge, which, along with other qualities like care and skill at their craft, allows them to excel as teachers. All teachers should have opportunities to deepen and upgrade their skills. That is why we will be emplacing outstanding non-graduate teachers on graduate pay scale.

Indeed, we will work with SMEs, whether as individual organisations or as an association. Let me share a very inspiring story. I recently met a Polytechnic student at the National Day Rally who designed our ASPIRE logo. He had just graduated from the Polytechnic and I asked him what he was doing. He had started work with a company, very similar work to what he was taught in the Polytechnic and he is a very talented designer. It was a small company. So, I asked him, ""What was the biggest difference between studying in the Polytechnic and now doing the work?"" He said, ""Well, the difference is that in the Polytechnic, I do one project for the term. Here, I have 10 projects anytime"". So, it is extremely challenging, but he said it is also an extremely rich learning experience and that because of this variety of work, he learns such a variety of skills because every client has a different need.

You would need to integrate all economically inactive residents with at least diploma qualifications before you match the Employment Pass numbers we now have, something that is clearly impossible.

The Committee rightly noted that students' internships can be a bit of a hit-and-miss affair with a wide range of students' experiences. The move to get educational institutions and industry partners to work more closely to ensure clear and relevant learning outcomes is good. However, it is also important that students do not misunderstand this to mean that the employers owe them a living and they should be doing interesting work all the time.

The practical difficulty is usually that during the internship itself, the exigencies at the workplace will trump any training plan, leaving interns to fend for themselves or help in repetitive tasks, such as storing documents for office renovations.

With the additional responsibilities expected of the host employer under ASPIRE, for example, providing suitable mentors, greater employer commitment and buy-in will be needed. Perhaps, one way of getting more buy-in from employers is to alleviate the current manpower demands by providing student manpower during the peak periods for the industry, or to de-conflict the internship periods among institutions to ensure employers have a steady stream of interns throughout the year.

The Committee highlighted the challenges that some students face in their studies, due to their different abilities and family difficulties. It was stated that there were adequate financial schemes to cater to the financial needs of students. However, it should not be assumed that all is well on the financial front. My own observation is that not all students who need the schemes eventually get helped by them. Families in financial difficulties are often unstable, with some even selling their homes and moving to stay in Johor Bahru. Some parents perceive the application process for financial aid as cumbersome; some even pressure their children to work or even to stop studies to work full-time. These cases need strong guidance and support.",13,280,012-002-092-013-018-280,466

However, I would like to suggest that it is important to beef up the capabilities of staff as well, to help students undergoing emotional or financial stress.

ASPIRE recommends developing sector-specific skills frameworks linked to progression pathways for each sector to serve as national benchmarks. The intention is for all employers and employees in a particular sector to have a common reference point, to facilitate promotion based on skills. The intention is a good one.

A case in point is the private security industry. For about a decade, a CET framework under the WSQ (Workforce Skills Qualification) scheme was devised. It aimed at imparting specific skillsets to security officers and supervisors, to enable them to be more professional and improve career paths. Yet, despite evidence that standards have risen and job scopes have increased, and despite a market shortage which can only be filled by locals and Malaysians, it remains a low-wage industry. Employers were also reluctant to send their staff for non-compulsory courses for two main reasons  first, more costs may have to be incurred to hire cover staff, and secondly, staff would expect to have pay increases after completing the courses. While each industry is different, I believe this experience with the private security industry may hold lessons for other sectors on the possible challenges and buy-in needed to make the frameworks and pathways produce results, to create the ""virtuous cycle"" we aim for.",16,283,012-002-092-013-018-283,469

I have personally had the experience of co-ordinating CET courses at my former workplace, where we had large cohorts of students who were law enforcement personnel working on different shifts.

In theory, staff who are better trained and have larger job scopes are more productive and, naturally, will justify higher salaries. Ideally, with better training, the organisation's productivity and earnings would rise, and employers would share those rewards down the hierarchy. However, there is no guarantee. On the other hand, some employers may be reluctant to send their staff for training, as staff would return from training expecting a pay increase, which, in turn, would increase employers' costs.",19,286,012-002-092-013-018-286,472

In our zeal to deepen technical competence and uphold pathways to success, we should be mindful that we do not inadvertently discourage individuals from pursuing higher academic qualifications just because of their starting point. We should ensure that ASPIRE's recommendations do not get translated into advising our ITE and Polytechnic graduates not to aspire. Where an individual has good academic potential, he should be encouraged to pursue those goals. Academic progression must always remain open. To this end, ITE graduates must be able to progress to Polytechnics, and Polytechnic graduates must be able to progress to public Universities. The recent set-up of the Singapore Institute of Technology is very welcome, as it gives Polytechnic graduates the opportunity to earn applied degrees in Singapore.

In this regard, the private sector fares better, as it tends to be more performance-oriented in its reward system. Instead, the biggest culprit at over-emphasising qualifications might actually have been the Government itself, as has been pointed out, which has even distinguished among the graduates  scholars and non-scholars have different career progression and pay, and employees with ""good"" Honours degrees may get higher starting ranks and pay than those with ""less good"" Honours degrees; the differences between graduates and non-graduates in the Civil Service are even more stark.

This is not a minor concern. The fear to lose – the ""kiasu"" syndrome that we laugh about – runs long and deep in our city's children and adults. It is this fear that gives birth to our neurotic obsession with status. It is this fear that displaces our faith in our children's unique strengths and interests and compels us to put our trust instead in excessive private tuition, examination results and paper qualifications as the best indicator and guarantee of future career success. So, it will be this fear that will hold many of us back from choosing ASPIRE's new way forward despite all indications that clinging onto the cultural excuse of kiasuism has been and always will be toxic for all of us.

When we rob our youths of their ability to choose what they want to study based on our own adult assumptions that it is ""too hard for them to score"" or ""will bring down our school ranking"" or ""will not earn you enough money in life"", we teach them very early on that no matter what people say, our society will only accept a certain pathway to success and you have no choice but to take it to its bitter end. Trying to convince them otherwise later down the road at an ITE, Polytechnic or University stage becomes extremely difficult. In 2001, 16,970 students took pure Literature at ""O"" Levels. In 2013, only 3,000 did.

In 2012, Raffles Institution introduced an innovative Gap Semester where 16-year-olds were given nine full weeks after their Year 4 final examinations to pursue non-academic interests and to make presentations on what they had learnt to their cohort. I do not see why this innovation cannot be introduced in other schools in some form. Imagine if every Singaporean teenager, from every kind of school, were given the blessing by their school system to take nine weeks off every year to intern in various industries, to consciously experience all sorts of work – blue-collar and white-collar, corporate and creative – and to earn a small allowance while they are at it.

Their career paths hardly crossed. For example, non-graduates started off as Junior Police Officers and it would take years or even decades for them to be promoted to the rank of Inspector, the lowest of the rank of senior officers. Returned overseas scholars receive higher pay even if they are of the same rank as the local graduates, regardless of their performance. I must say that most overseas scholars generally perform much better than the other graduates. However, there are some who do not perform as well and that sours the feelings of the majority of the Police officers. I understand that similar situations occur in the Army and many other Government departments.

For the Civil Service, it adheres to the policy of hiring on merit, so the most suitable candidate is selected for the job. For new jobseekers at entry level jobs, the educational qualifications would have to serve as a proxy because you do not know the person, you do not know their capabilities yet. So, that is entry level. And some jobs require a degree; some do not. So, when recruiting, the Civil Service will indicate what kind of qualification is required according to job type. And there will be certain professional fields where professional accreditation is required, for example, medical or engineering.
