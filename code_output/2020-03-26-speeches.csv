2020-03-26,Schools and Post-secondary Educational Institutions with Lactation Rooms,013-002-094-128-001,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"  I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the reply. Can I just check whether these are specifically lactation rooms? So, it is only for the mothers to use and not just a spare room where the mothers can go in to express the milk. Secondly, can I also just check whether there is a fridge in all of these rooms so that they can store their milk after that?",1,4,013-002-094-128-001-004,4
2020-03-26,Schools and Post-secondary Educational Institutions with Lactation Rooms,013-002-094-128-001,Ms Low Yen Ling,"  Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the Member Mr Louis Ng for his care and concern for mothers. As a mother of two kids, and I have breastfed my two kids for slightly over a year, I can understand what it takes to persevere in the breastfeeding journey. For example, the breastfeeding cycle and also the schedule, from expressing and then storing the milk – and the Member asked about the fridge – transporting the precious milk and also all the gadgets that are involved, especially for mothers who need to express milk in their office, workplace and in this case, in the school.",1,5,013-002-094-128-001-005,5

2020-03-26,Schools and Post-secondary Educational Institutions with Lactation Rooms,013-002-094-128-001,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Let me be clear. Since 2010, the requirement for a lactation room was added to the building specification for Primary schools as part of the PERI upgrading. This is a standard building specification  lactation room in the school. Subsequently, the same building specification for Secondary schools and also Junior Colleges were similarly updated with the same requirement. So, yes. These are lactation rooms, not meant to be multi-purpose for other reasons.",3,7,013-002-094-128-001-007,7
2020-03-26,Schools and Post-secondary Educational Institutions with Lactation Rooms,013-002-094-128-001,Ms Low Yen Ling,"Schools that were built or upgraded before 2010 will also be provided with a lactation room as part of their on-going or scheduled PERI upgrading for Primary schools; likewise, for the Secondary schools and the Junior Colleges, when the institutions next undergo rebuilding or major upgrading. For the lactation rooms, we will provide the necessary facilities and also the fridges; if not in the lactation room, then maybe in the Staff Lounge. We would then have to work with the teachers who are mothers and are breastfeeding to make sure that they will label the bottles accordingly.",4,8,013-002-094-128-001-008,8
2020-03-26,Schools and Post-secondary Educational Institutions with Lactation Rooms,013-002-094-128-001,Ms Low Yen Ling,"The other thing I wish to reassure the Member is, I gave the numbers for Primary schools and Secondary schools. What is very heartening is that to-date, all our IHLs have lactation facilities. In fact, some of the bigger campuses have more than one lactation room. I want to assure the Member that MOE will certainly continue to work with the existing schools to ensure that all schools will have lactation rooms at the nearest feasible date. The target for us, really, is for every school to have lactation facilities within the next three years.",5,9,013-002-094-128-001-009,9

I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for saying that it is not prohibited on our trains and buses. But as I shared with him, the SMRT website still says this today to an FAQ, ""Can I breastfeed or feed my children?"" And the reply is, ""For the comfort of other passengers, it is best to feed your children before entering our stations."" So, if it is not prohibited, then, could we not send the message to say that it is best not to do it?",1,4,013-002-094-128-003-004,19

The estimated retrenchment rate for PRs is actually much higher than that for citizens. On average, a citizen is just above half as likely as a PR to be retrenched. The citizen retrenchment estimate would go up if you assume that 10% of citizens are self-employed, but not by so much as to cover this gap.",29,31,013-002-094-128-012-031,425

There is little surprising about the first few points I made because PRs are often granted based on economic criteria.

Most economists would argue the net effect of immigration is positive for the Singapore economy. The problem is that the net effect may hide substantial redistribution to the incomes and wealth of many Singaporeans. Some Singaporeans will have skills that are complemented by immigration and will have better job opportunities and wages, but others may see their job prospects harmed by competition for jobs that immigrants are also highly skilled in. Many Singaporeans also own assets ranging from property to stakes in businesses. These too benefit from immigration, so it affects wealth and not just the labour market.",32,34,013-002-094-128-012-034,428

Respondents also felt strongly that immigrants were not doing enough to integrate. Close to 40% of respondents felt that immigration issues, if mismanaged, could lead to communal anger; a decreased sense of national identity; and a fall in trust in Government.

I believe we must confront the facts. There are distributional consequences of immigration and despite our best efforts at calibrating immigration flows and manpower policy, some Singaporeans will be better off and some worse off. We need research that documents how immigrants have contributed to our economy, as well as how immigrants have affected employment prospects and outcomes of locals. We need to understand who among our immigrants decides to put down roots in Singapore and who does not stay, and how they assimilate over time. And we need to be prepared to grant targeted help to locals whom we discover are adversely affected by immigration, because the net positives of immigration for the country do not mean anything if your own livelihood is affected.",35,37,013-002-094-128-012-037,431
