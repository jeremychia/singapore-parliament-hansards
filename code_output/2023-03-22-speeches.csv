2023-03-22,Adequacy of Supply of School Bus Services,014-001-095-095-001,Mr Leon Perera,asked the Minister for Education (a) whether the Ministry can provide an update on the adequacy of the supply of school bus services; (b) whether an update on the same can be provided specifically for Special Education schools; and (c) what is the average increase in school bus fares seen in 2022.,1,1,014-001-095-095-001-001,1
2023-03-22,Adequacy of Supply of School Bus Services,014-001-095-095-001,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Gan Siow Huang) (for the Minister for Education),"  The Ministry of Education (MOE) has been monitoring the provision of school bus services. The demand for school bus services has been relatively stable, as we continue to have 98% of our Primary 1 students able to obtain a place either in a primary school of their choice or within two kilometres of their residence.",1,2,014-001-095-095-001-002,2
2023-03-22,Adequacy of Supply of School Bus Services,014-001-095-095-001,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Gan Siow Huang) (for the Minister for Education),"However, based on our engagement with some school bus service providers, they have provided feedback on a shortage of bus drivers, with the post-COVID-19 reopening of the economy being a factor. This was also compounded by the rising fuel prices which have affected the viability of some of these providers.",2,3,014-001-095-095-001-003,3
2023-03-22,Adequacy of Supply of School Bus Services,014-001-095-095-001,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Gan Siow Huang) (for the Minister for Education),"Despite these challenges, most providers have continued providing school bus services, but have to raise their fares to reflect both rising costs and the need for the industry to attract and retain sufficient school bus drivers. These are issues which MOE is engaging the relevant stakeholders to address.",3,4,014-001-095-095-001-004,4
2023-03-22,Adequacy of Supply of School Bus Services,014-001-095-095-001,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Gan Siow Huang) (for the Minister for Education),"For most MOE schools, the bus fares have gone up by up to 10% in 2023 compared to 2022, while special education (SPED) schools have generally seen a higher increase due to the smaller pool of bus operators who are able to meet their more complex needs.",4,5,014-001-095-095-001-005,5
2023-03-22,Adequacy of Supply of School Bus Services,014-001-095-095-001,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Gan Siow Huang) (for the Minister for Education),"To better ensure affordability of transport costs to school for lower-income students, MOE has enhanced the school bus subsidy from 60% of monthly school bus fares to 65% since January 2023. This will reduce the amount paid by the families of these needy students and help mitigate the increase in school bus fares. Beyond that, in situations where the family needs more help, the schools are able to provide more financial assistance to cover the school bus fares.",5,6,014-001-095-095-001-006,6
2023-03-22,Adequacy of Supply of School Bus Services,014-001-095-095-001,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Gan Siow Huang) (for the Minister for Education),"Likewise, for SPED schools, eligible students taking school bus services can apply for the Enabling Transport Subsidy (ETS), administered by SG Enable, which was increased from 1 July 2022 to help defray the cost of school bus fares. Beyond that, the SPED schools are able to provide further discretionary support to needy students who may need additional help with their school bus fares.",6,7,014-001-095-095-001-007,7
2023-03-22,Adequacy of Supply of School Bus Services,014-001-095-095-001,The Minister of State for Education (Ms Gan Siow Huang) (for the Minister for Education),"Both the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and MOE will continue to closely monitor the school bus fare situation, and if need be, step up financial support for needy students who have to travel by school bus.",7,8,014-001-095-095-001-008,8
2023-03-22,Adequacy of Supply of School Bus Services,014-001-095-095-001,Mr Speaker,  Mr Perera.,1,9,014-001-095-095-001-009,9
2023-03-22,Adequacy of Supply of School Bus Services,014-001-095-095-001,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"  I thank the Minister of State for her answer. Just two supplementary questions. My understanding of the school bus operator population is that – and I will stand corrected if this is not not borne out by the facts – but my understanding is that it is an ageing population and many of these operators are set up as sole proprietorships. They may employ a very small number of people, may drive the buses themselves. Over time, we can expect that there will be exits from the industry.",1,10,014-001-095-095-001-010,10
2023-03-22,Adequacy of Supply of School Bus Services,014-001-095-095-001,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Is the Ministry looking at how to address that? Because as the population ages, there could be certain solutions that we need to look at. For example, facilitating these micro businesses to to sell their business to a more organised operator – I just mentioned that as one possibility.",2,11,014-001-095-095-001-011,11
2023-03-22,Adequacy of Supply of School Bus Services,014-001-095-095-001,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"My second supplementary question is on the school bus services for SPED schools. I wanted to ask what sort of training is made available to the bus operators for SPED schools, given the complexity that is involved in that, which is different from just operating a bus for mainstream schools. Sometimes, there could be certain types of skills that they need to have in order to do their job effectively. I have encountered one issue with one of my constituents in the Serangoon ward of the Aljunied Group Representative Constituency (GRC). So, I am wondering what sort of training is given to these bus operators.",3,12,014-001-095-095-001-012,12
2023-03-22,Adequacy of Supply of School Bus Services,014-001-095-095-001,Ms Gan Siow Huang,"  I thank the Member for the two supplementary questions. Indeed, the school bus industry is quite a fragmented one, with many sole proprietors. We at MOE ourselves are also beginning to learn about this industry and we are in discussion with other agencies. We are starting to engage the school bus operators to see what kind of help we can provide to facilitate this industry to stay viable in the long term and to support the needs of our students for school bus services.",1,13,014-001-095-095-001-013,13
2023-03-22,Adequacy of Supply of School Bus Services,014-001-095-095-001,Ms Gan Siow Huang,"As to the training, MOE does not provide training to the school bus operators of SPED schools. Instead, what our schools normally do is specify in the contracts what kind of skills and services we require the school bus operators to be equipped with, either for the drivers or the minders in the buses.",2,14,014-001-095-095-001-014,14
2023-03-22,Working with Hospitals to Increase Use of Infant Car Seats,014-001-095-095-002,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang,asked the Minister for Transport what are the steps the Ministry has taken to work with hospitals in increasing access to the use of infant car seats.,1,1,014-001-095-095-002-001,15
2023-03-22,Working with Hospitals to Increase Use of Infant Car Seats,014-001-095-095-002,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng) (for the Minister for Transport),"  Mr Speaker, please allow me, on behalf of the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) and PUB, to wish everybody a Happy Water Day.",1,2,014-001-095-095-002-002,16
2023-03-22,Working with Hospitals to Increase Use of Infant Car Seats,014-001-095-095-002,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng) (for the Minister for Transport),"Now, back to the Ministry of Transport (MOT). Sir, the requirement for the use of appropriate child restraints in private vehicles, such as infant car seats, is a long-standing one which parents are generally aware of.",2,3,014-001-095-095-002-003,17
2023-03-22,Working with Hospitals to Increase Use of Infant Car Seats,014-001-095-095-002,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng) (for the Minister for Transport),A range of child restraint solutions are available in the market. We have no plans to work with hospitals to further increase access to the use of infant car seats.,3,4,014-001-095-095-002-004,18
2023-03-22,Working with Hospitals to Increase Use of Infant Car Seats,014-001-095-095-002,Mr Speaker,  Mr Louis Ng.,1,5,014-001-095-095-002-005,19
2023-03-22,Working with Hospitals to Increase Use of Infant Car Seats,014-001-095-095-002,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"  Thank you, Sir. In my Adjournment Motion about a year ago, I had raised this as a recommendation for MOT to work with the hospitals to increase access and use of infant car seats. I believe the Senior Parliamentary Secretary replied in his speech that this is a new idea that he would share with relevant agencies and stakeholders.",1,6,014-001-095-095-002-006,20
2023-03-22,Working with Hospitals to Increase Use of Infant Car Seats,014-001-095-095-002,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"So, one, could I ask whether this recommendation has been shared the relevant stakeholders and the relevant agencies as well? And two whether the recommendations I proposed have been looked into, which included I believe the hospitals to include in their prenatal class, the use of infant car seats, the provision of infant car seats to parents who upon discharge do not have one, even including into the bill. I believe the Senior Parliamentary Secretary said all this will be looked into.",2,7,014-001-095-095-002-007,21
2023-03-22,Working with Hospitals to Increase Use of Infant Car Seats,014-001-095-095-002,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"  Yes, indeed, we did look into it. And since then, we have checked with the agencies to understand that currently the Traffic Police (TP) has partnered KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH)  to educate the public on road safety, including road safety for child passengers. For example, TP provided input for KKH's educational collaterals on the use of use of child car seats. Such collaborations have been increasing awareness among parents, especially new parents, about the requirements for child restraints and their correct use.",1,8,014-001-095-095-002-008,22
2023-03-22,Working with Hospitals to Increase Use of Infant Car Seats,014-001-095-095-002,Mr Baey Yam Keng,These current arrangements already are helping parents and we know many parents are concerned about the safety of their children.,2,9,014-001-095-095-002-009,23
2023-03-22,Working with Hospitals to Increase Use of Infant Car Seats,014-001-095-095-002,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"As for the Ministry of Health (MOH), MOH's budget subsidises healthcare with the aim of ensuring that basic healthcare remains affordable and accessible for the general population. This includes healthcare services, drugs, devices and various therapeutics and medical technology. Infant car seats are not within the scope of healthcare subsidies.",3,10,014-001-095-095-002-010,24
2023-03-22,Larger Role for Singapore in Realising ASEAN Power Grid,014-001-095-095-003,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the Government envisions a larger role for Singapore in realising the ASEAN Power Grid; and (b) whether the Government is considering direct investments in renewable and sustainable cross-border electricity infrastructure to ensure electricity sustainability.,1,1,014-001-095-095-003-001,25
2023-03-22,Larger Role for Singapore in Realising ASEAN Power Grid,014-001-095-095-003,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),  The ASEAN Power Grid is ASEAN’s vision to integrate the national power systems of its 10 member states. This will create opportunities for mutual support and electricity trading among the member states. The support of all ASEAN member states is necessary to realise this vision. And Singapore is committed to playing our part.,1,2,014-001-095-095-003-002,26
2023-03-22,Larger Role for Singapore in Realising ASEAN Power Grid,014-001-095-095-003,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Singapore has been working with various countries on pathfinder projects such as the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project. We have also signed several Memoranda of Understanding with like-minded countries such as Cambodia, Lao PDR and Vietnam – and I think Members know, with Indonesia as well – to advance our collective energy interests and facilitate regional decarbonisation.",2,3,014-001-095-095-003-003,27

2023-03-22,Larger Role for Singapore in Realising ASEAN Power Grid,014-001-095-095-003,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),We are also working with the US on a feasibility study on regional energy connectivity to support the development of the ASEAN Power Grid. The ASEAN Power Grid can facilitate ASEAN’s decarbonisation efforts. There is significant renewable energy potential in the Southeast Asia region. Building energy interconnections can help to realise this potential by joining the producing regions to the consumption points or regions.,4,5,014-001-095-095-003-005,29
2023-03-22,Larger Role for Singapore in Realising ASEAN Power Grid,014-001-095-095-003,The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"At this point in time, the Government does not intend to invest directly in cross-border infrastructure. Our focus is to work with regional partners to provide the framework, regulations as well as the ecosystem that will enable commercial players to build the infrastructure. We will continue to work closely with all of our regional partners and with this year’s ASEAN Chair, Indonesia, to realise the ASEAN Power Grid.",5,6,014-001-095-095-003-006,30
2023-03-22,Impact of Mental Health-related Condition on Eligibility for Home Protection Scheme,014-001-095-095-004,Mr Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether having a mental health-related condition is a ground for being ineligible for the Home Protection Scheme (HPS); (b) if so, what is the rationale; and (c) what specific mental health-related conditions will prevent the take-up of HPS.",1,1,014-001-095-095-004-001,31
2023-03-22,Impact of Mental Health-related Condition on Eligibility for Home Protection Scheme,014-001-095-095-004,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"  Mr Speaker, Sir, the Home Protection Scheme (HPS) is a mortgage reducing insurance that protects CPF members and their families from losing their HDB flats in the event of the member’s death, terminal illness, or total permanent disability.",1,2,014-001-095-095-004-002,32
2023-03-22,Impact of Mental Health-related Condition on Eligibility for Home Protection Scheme,014-001-095-095-004,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"Having a mental health-related condition is not necessarily a ground that would make a person ineligible for the HPS. Instead, a member’s eligibility for the HPS is assessed based on the overall severity, prognosis and control of the medical condition as well as their health risk profile.",2,3,014-001-095-095-004-003,33
2023-03-22,Impact of Mental Health-related Condition on Eligibility for Home Protection Scheme,014-001-095-095-004,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"Hence, even for members with pre-existing mental health-related conditions, a majority of them are covered under the scheme because their conditions are assessed by medical professionals to be mild or moderate.",3,4,014-001-095-095-004-004,34
2023-03-22,Impact of Mental Health-related Condition on Eligibility for Home Protection Scheme,014-001-095-095-004,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"Notwithstanding this, the HPS coverage is not extended to applicants with serious pre-existing medical conditions, including serious mental health-related conditions, if they are assessed to have significantly higher risk of mortality. Members of the House, this is in line with industry practice. This ensures the affordability of premiums for the majority of members as well as the viability of the scheme.",4,5,014-001-095-095-004-005,35
2023-03-22,Impact of Mental Health-related Condition on Eligibility for Home Protection Scheme,014-001-095-095-004,Mr Speaker,  Mr Perera.,1,6,014-001-095-095-004-006,36
2023-03-22,Impact of Mental Health-related Condition on Eligibility for Home Protection Scheme,014-001-095-095-004,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"  I thank the Minister. Just two supplementary questions. Firstly, just to clarify my understanding of what he said, the relevant authorities will take a nuanced approach looking at the extent of the mental health condition and also the nature of the mental health condition – I think different types of conditions may have different implications in terms of behaviour and in terms of the propensity to do different things that could affect the actuarial basis of the scheme. So, just want to confirm the understanding that you would be looking at severity as well as the type of mental health conditions to decide on eligibility.",1,7,014-001-095-095-004-007,37
2023-03-22,Impact of Mental Health-related Condition on Eligibility for Home Protection Scheme,014-001-095-095-004,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"My second supplementary question is, when looking at these issues, does the Government take into consideration that whatever the actuarial science says about people with mental health conditions who go on to schemes like this, that data may have come about in the past when the extent of diagnosis of mental health conditions was maybe much, much less than what it is now and what it will be in the future, with growing awareness of mental health issues and as we move away from the stigmatisation and discrimination of people with mental health conditions, and you can expect that more people will be diagnosed – so, are we using data from the past in order to draw an actuarial conclusion about the present day? Is that taken into consideration as well?",2,8,014-001-095-095-004-008,38
2023-03-22,Impact of Mental Health-related Condition on Eligibility for Home Protection Scheme,014-001-095-095-004,Dr Tan See Leng,"  Mr Speaker, I think to the first supplementary question, the answer is yes. We do take a nuanced approach; we depend on medical experts; we are certainly not the experts in determining what is the level of severity, the prognosis, to whether the actuarial risks associated with the mortality or morbidity as a result of a particular illness. So, we do take a nuanced approach, but it is based on advice from experts and medical experts, including psychiatric experts, if you talk about mental illness.",1,9,014-001-095-095-004-009,39
2023-03-22,Impact of Mental Health-related Condition on Eligibility for Home Protection Scheme,014-001-095-095-004,Dr Tan See Leng,"What we do need, however, is for the members at the point of signing, to disclose upfront the pre-existing conditions that they have. Because you can imagine and you can surmise or conclude that if you disclose it after the event and you have a pre-existing condition that you do not disclose upfront and if something then happens, after that for you then go back and have all that data, I think it would be very difficult for us to access that data.",2,10,014-001-095-095-004-010,40

2023-03-22,Impact of Mental Health-related Condition on Eligibility for Home Protection Scheme,014-001-095-095-004,,"To the second supplementary question, in terms of the extent of the diagnosis, we constantly and continuously review the data that is available. And I think this is not something that is carved in stone in terms of the coverage. However, because of the fact that the HPS is constructed to be as widespread and as pervasive as possible to support the broadest segment of our population in their home protection – for them to be able to continue to cover the loans in the event of total permanent disability and so on and so forth – we also want to keep the scheme sustainable and affordable. Hence, the approach is a very balanced, very measured and a calibrated one. I hope that addresses your query.",2,12,014-001-095-095-004-012,42

One example is a web-based system integrating technology to enhance care at home, including the use of smart home sensors to detect falls, automated pill dispensers to track medication adherence and  a nutrition database that recommends meals based on the senior's health condition. Another used artificial intelligence to provide personalised educational resources and care triage services to caregivers.

Just one clarification. Does the Government think that it should increase its resources, to allocate more resources to develop more and better technologies to better assist caregivers in their everyday roles?",1,6,014-001-095-095-005-006,49
2023-03-22,Research and Pilot Trials to Promote and Expand Use of Productivity-enhancing Technologies by Care Providers ,014-001-095-095-005,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"  Sir, the answer is yes. Not all of the resource allocation is tagged specifically to digitalisation or care or elderly. There is great overlap in many of the projects  something that applies to acute care may well have an impact on elderly care; something that applies within the hospital may have an impact on the community; something which is labelled as a productivity improvement may indeed rest on digitalisation.",1,7,014-001-095-095-005-007,50

So, I think in a tight labour market, as I have explained, one who is unfairly terminated and being asked to come back as a platform worker, for example, I think that is unfair. But they do have choices too to work for someone else. Certainly, for the the employer, it is not too wise to do so, in a sense that once you are self-employed, you can serve multiple employees too.

Countries, such as Kenya, Rwanda and our neighbouring Thailand, have introduced stringent rules on the production and usage of plastic bags. Kenya, in particular, has implemented what has been called ""the world's strictest plastic ban"" and banned all single-use plastic bags throughout the country. Three years after they did so, some of their national parks began disallowing all single-use plastics on the premises.
