2022-11-28,Point of Order,014-001-095-076-001,Mr Speaker,"  Mr Leong, I believe the Leader has spoken to the Leader of the Opposition. Members of Parliament (MPs) have filed questions about the FTX situation  some are for oral answer today, while some are up for oral answer tomorrow. I have discussed this with the Leader of the House. Given the volume of business for this Sitting, we will be sitting until Wednesday, 30 November 2022. I think it is best that all the FTX questions be answered holistically by the Government on Wednesday. This will allow other Parliamentary Questions (PQs) to be cleared and I will allocate sufficient time on Wednesday for the FTX PQs and supplementary questions to be answered fully.",1,5,014-001-095-076-001-005,5

2022-11-28,One-time Wage Adjustment for Civil Servants to Offset Anticipated High Core Inflation Rate in 2022,014-001-095-076-002,Mr Ang Wei Neng,asked the Prime Minister whether the Public Service Division will be considering a one-time wage adjustment for all civil servants to offset the anticipated high core inflation rate in 2022.,1,1,014-001-095-076-002-001,8
2022-11-28,One-time Wage Adjustment for Civil Servants to Offset Anticipated High Core Inflation Rate in 2022,014-001-095-076-002,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing) (for the Prime Minister),"  Mr Speaker, Sir, the Civil Service periodically reviews salaries and adjusts them when necessary to keep pace with, but not lead, the market. The recent salary adjustments for various groups of civil servants were determined based on salary gaps with market benchmarks. Beyond these adjustments, eligible officers also receive Annual Variable Component (AVC) payments and annual salary increments that take into consideration their performance, prevailing economic and labour market conditions and the National Wages Council’s recommendations on progressive wage growth.",1,2,014-001-095-076-002-002,9

These support measures together will help to cushion the impact of sharp inflation changes and provide further relief for Singaporean households, with more support for lower- to middle-income groups.",3,4,014-001-095-076-002-004,11

2022-11-28,One-time Wage Adjustment for Civil Servants to Offset Anticipated High Core Inflation Rate in 2022,014-001-095-076-002,Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast),"  Thank you, Speaker. I thank the Minister for the comprehensive reply. Can I just clarify one point? Minister was saying that with the recent adjustments in the civil service pay, every civil servant will get at least more than 5.1% of the salary increment because the core inflation rate in October is 5.1%? At the same time, we notice that there is a report in The Straits Times to say that about 68% of the employees were thinking of changing jobs if their pay is not increased more than the inflation rate.",1,6,014-001-095-076-002-006,13

2022-11-28,One-time Wage Adjustment for Civil Servants to Offset Anticipated High Core Inflation Rate in 2022,014-001-095-076-002,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"  Mr Speaker, Sir, to answer to the first supplementary question, as I have said, the salary increases arising from the recent salary reviews, plus annual salary increments, plus the AVC payments will more than exceed the inflation rate this year, for all the civil servants who meet the criteria. There might be a very, very small number of people who do not meet the performance criteria and they might be short of that 5% that the Member mentioned. But that is a very, very small number of people who do not meet the performance criteria. On top of that, the Government has all the other packages for all the Singaporean households, which we think will be able to meet the requirement to help those who are most in need.",1,9,014-001-095-076-002-009,16

2022-11-28,Regulation of Ownership of Personal Mobility Aids to Prevent Their Misuse and Abuse,014-001-095-076-003,Ms Carrie Tan,asked the Minister for Transport (a) how is the ownership of personal mobility aids (PMAs) being regulated; (b) whether the Ministry will consider tightening the ownership requirements for PMAs to prevent their proliferation from misuse and abuse; (c) how does the Ministry monitor whether the PMAs in use are in compliance with safety standards; (d) how can members of the public report PMAs being misused; and (e) what are the enforcement actions that will be taken following reports of non-compliant PMAs to the Ministry.,1,1,014-001-095-076-003-001,18
2022-11-28,Regulation of Ownership of Personal Mobility Aids to Prevent Their Misuse and Abuse,014-001-095-076-003,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng) (for the Minister for Transport),"  Mr Speaker, Sir, we want to make personal mobility aids, or PMAs, accessible for the many Singaporeans who rely on them for diverse daily commuting needs.",1,2,014-001-095-076-003-002,19
2022-11-28,Regulation of Ownership of Personal Mobility Aids to Prevent Their Misuse and Abuse,014-001-095-076-003,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng) (for the Minister for Transport),"Rather than regulate ownership, LTA has regulations to ensure that PMAs are safe for use on public paths. All PMAs, which include mobility scooters and motorised wheelchairs, have a maximum speed of 10 kilometres per hour (km/h) and mobility scooters must only have a single seat, among other requirements. LTA conducts regular enforcement efforts islandwide and users found to be using non-compliant devices may face a fine of up to $10,000 and imprisonment of up to six months, and also have their devices impounded. Members of the public may report incidents of errant device users on public paths to LTA through the MyTransport.SG mobile application, or at feedback@lta.gov.sg.",2,3,014-001-095-076-003-003,20

As part of the workplan of the Active Mobility Advisory Panel, which started its new term in January 2022, there will be a review of the rules and restrictions applicable to PMAs, such as setting pre-conditions for a person to use PMAs.",3,4,014-001-095-076-003-004,21

2022-11-28,Regulation of Ownership of Personal Mobility Aids to Prevent Their Misuse and Abuse,014-001-095-076-003,Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon),"  Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the answer. I would like to understand in terms of the public reporting misuse of PMAs, it is not uncommon for us to see people on the streets ferrying grandchildren or ferrying a boyfriend or a girlfriend on PMAs. So, if a member of the public sees this, can you explain how exactly can they report this on the OneMotoring app? Do they take a picture and submit the picture? What would be the enforcement actions that will follow?",1,6,014-001-095-076-003-006,23
2022-11-28,Regulation of Ownership of Personal Mobility Aids to Prevent Their Misuse and Abuse,014-001-095-076-003,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"  When members of the public report such cases, it could be through a video, a photograph or just information about the incident via the MyTransport.SG app. LTA will collate the information based on the locations where these errant users are or non-compliant devices are used. LTA will identify these hotspot areas  where they will step up enforcement actions on the ground. I hope for Members and public's understanding that LTA will not be able to deploy and enforce immediately because, by the time they reach the spots, the riders would already not be there. But the information is very useful for us to know which are the hotspot areas so that more enforcement could be deployed there.",1,7,014-001-095-076-003-007,24
2022-11-28,Impact of Layoffs by Big Tech Companies and Support Available for Affected Employees,014-001-095-076-004,Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling,asked the Minister for Manpower with the recent big tech companies’ layoff announcements (a) what is the total estimated number of workers impacted in Singapore; and (b) whether this will have a knock-on effect on salary adjustment of workers in the tech industry.,1,1,014-001-095-076-004-001,25

2022-11-28,Impact of Layoffs by Big Tech Companies and Support Available for Affected Employees,014-001-095-076-004,Dr Tan See Leng,"  Members have filed several Parliamentary Questions (PQs) regarding the recent spate of layoffs worldwide by tech firms. News sources have reported global retrenchment numbers at more than 21,000 employees across close to 50 tech companies worldwide in November 2022 alone, more than any other month this year. Members’ questions touch on two related issues. First, the impact of recent global tech layoffs on our local workforce. Second, the employment support measures for affected workers. I am taking these questions together to provide a more holistic response.",1,7,014-001-095-076-004-007,31
2022-11-28,Impact of Layoffs by Big Tech Companies and Support Available for Affected Employees,014-001-095-076-004,Dr Tan See Leng,"I will begin with an overview of employment trends in the tech sector, as well as the impact of recent global tech layoffs on our local workforce. While there are no clearly defined boundaries, the tech sector generally refers to the Information and Communications (I&C) sector. As of June 2022, the I&C sector employs 136,100 residents. This number has increased steadily over the past five years, growing by an average of 8,100 resident workers per year from June 2017 to June 2022. In comparison, retrenchment numbers over the past five years have been relatively low, at an average of 790 resident workers per year.",2,8,014-001-095-076-004-008,32
2022-11-28,Impact of Layoffs by Big Tech Companies and Support Available for Affected Employees,014-001-095-076-004,Dr Tan See Leng,"Mr Shawn Huang, Mr Melvin Yong and Ms He Ting Ru have also filed written questions asking about retrenchment in the sector in 2022. Based on the available labour market data, 260 residents were retrenched in the first half of this year, as compared to an increase of 7,000 residents employed in the sector.",3,9,014-001-095-076-004-009,33
2022-11-28,Impact of Layoffs by Big Tech Companies and Support Available for Affected Employees,014-001-095-076-004,Dr Tan See Leng,"Nonetheless, recent retrenchment notices received by MOM indicate an uptick in retrenchment of residents in the sector. In response to Miss Cheryl Chan, Ms Mariam Jaafar, Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Dr Shahira Abdullah’s questions on the number and profile of workers affected by recent layoffs, MOM has received notices of retrenchment for 1,270 resident workers from tech companies from July to mid-November 2022. Around eight in 10 of these affected workers were in non-tech roles – they worked for tech companies but they were in non-tech roles – such as sales, marketing and corporate functions, and around seven in 10 were aged 35 and below. This is consistent with the low median age of employed residents in the I&C sector.",4,10,014-001-095-076-004-010,34
2022-11-28,Impact of Layoffs by Big Tech Companies and Support Available for Affected Employees,014-001-095-076-004,Dr Tan See Leng,"Next, on employment support measures for affected workers. Most workers from the I&C sector have been able to secure a job soon after retrenchment. In the second quarter of 2022, the rate of re-entry into employment within six months post-retrenchment for residents in the sector was higher than for the overall economy, for both tech and non-tech workers. This suggests that retrenched non-tech workers had also found employment opportunities across the I&C sector and the larger economy.",5,11,014-001-095-076-004-011,35
2022-11-28,Impact of Layoffs by Big Tech Companies and Support Available for Affected Employees,014-001-095-076-004,Dr Tan See Leng,"To Dr Shahira Abdullah’s question on whether demand for tech talent has started to fall this year, job vacancies in the I&C sector have in fact continued to rise in the first half of this year, from 11,100 in December 2021 to 12,100 in June 2022. This latest figure is more than triple the 3,800 vacancies in June 2020. In addition, other sectors like financial services, including local banks, are also hiring for tech roles. Taken together, this reflects that there is strong absorptive capacity across the larger economy and opportunities for affected workers to fill in-demand roles.",6,12,014-001-095-076-004-012,36
2022-11-28,Impact of Layoffs by Big Tech Companies and Support Available for Affected Employees,014-001-095-076-004,Dr Tan See Leng,"Furthermore, half of the retrenching tech firms between July and mid-November 2022 have engaged outplacement partners or tapped on their industry networks to provide career transition services for their affected workers. In addition, the Taskforce for Responsible Retrenchment and Employment Facilitation (RTF), comprising representatives from Workforce Singapore (WSG) and NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute (e2i), is reaching out to all affected local employees, including the youths which Dr Shahira Abdullah has asked about, to offer employment support.

I thank the Minister for his reply. I have one supplementary question. Employees who have been dismissed or retrenched may need assistance, but may feel that the HR of their company are not on their side due to various circumstances. Would MOM be able to provide a channel or dedicated hotline for such employees to seek some advice as to what they can do and what options they have?",1,22,014-001-095-076-004-022,46

Today, there is a Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) hotline that these employees can call, although it is not purely dedicated to retrenchments alone.

Generally, the employees who are being retrenched in the tech roles have been able to find jobs much faster post-retrenchment compared to those in the non-tech roles, which takes a bit longer. Hence, the RTF is also focusing on helping retrenched employees in these non-tech roles to upgrade, to convert the skills, to pivot and to allow them a much better chance of getting employment. Thus far, we have been reasonably successful.",3,25,014-001-095-076-004-025,49

I thank the Minister for his reply. I think he had not responded to the second part of my Parliamentary Question (PQ), which is whether this layoff will have a knock-on effect on the salary adjustment of workers in the tech industry. The Minister pointed out just now, that a large majority who were laid off were actually in the non-tech domain. The fact that they had been coming from the big tech firms, the salary adjustments would be quite significant for some of them, if they have to do career conversion or if they have to go to other companies that are not in this big tech space.

Thus far, from the statistics that we have, the median income of workers in the I&C sector, has been on an upward trajectory, with the median gross monthly income, which includes employer's CPF, for full-time employed residents increasing from $5,700 in 2017 to $6,100 in 2021. As for the median salary of non-tech employees who have been retrenched, we do not have that data because retrenching firms are not required to include the salary data of retrenched employees when submitting Mandatory Retrenchment Notifications (MRNs) to the Ministry. Hence, I am unable to comment on the breakdown of the non-tech roles of these employees who are being retrenched and whether they will experience knock-on effects on salary adjustment later on.",1,28,014-001-095-076-004-028,52

Under the Public Order Act, event organisers, otherwise known as EOs, are required to notify the Police of public events expected to attract crowds of 5,000 persons or more, or private events expected to attract crowds of 10,000 persons or more.

These plans may include measures such as the monitoring of crowd size, the deployment of security personnel and the regulation of crowd flow at congregation areas and potential chokepoints. They may also include cordoning off areas with public safety risks, such as narrow pathways and bridges and signages to guide the public on diversions and closures of thoroughfares.",2,11,014-001-095-076-006-011,106

Under the Fire Code, functional spaces within a building are assigned an occupant load factor which determines the maximum number of people allowed at any point of time and there must also be sufficient egress capacity. In general, the Fire Code requires every storey of a building to have at least two independent exit staircases to ensure timely evacuation. Higher risk premises, such as those with an occupant load of 1,000 persons or more; floor area of 5,000 square metres (sqm) or more; or nine storeys or more, including basement levels, require an FSM to be appointed.",4,13,014-001-095-076-006-013,108

The Police may also pre-empt the public on potential crowding and alert the public to avoid areas or events which are already crowded.

I just have two supplementary questions. What lessons has MHA learnt or drawn from the recent tragedies in South Korea and Indonesia, to ensure that such incidents do not occur in Singapore.

2022-11-28,Measures to Prevent and Manage Risks from Crowd Surges during Festive Periods and Public Events,014-001-095-076-006,Ms Sun Xueling,"First and foremost, many of the questions filed were about the number of persons or the size of the crowd. But I think what is also important to understand and acknowledge is that it is not just about the absolute size of the crowd. You can have a situation whereby the absolute size is not very large, but actually, they are in a very concentrated, very congested area; and that there might not be entry and exit points that are regularly available.",2,22,014-001-095-076-006-022,117
2022-11-28,Measures to Prevent and Manage Risks from Crowd Surges during Festive Periods and Public Events,014-001-095-076-006,Ms Sun Xueling,"So, I just wanted to clarify and elaborate that it is not just about the absolute size of the crowd, but about the specific terrain that we are looking at. So, before any incident happens, when the Police is aware that there is an event that is about to happen, when they receive notification of the application for the event, the Police actually works with the EOs to understand the lay of the land, to get a sense of what are the entry and exit points, to see whether or not, at least, from what we can understand pre-event, that this is an area whereby pre-emptively, we can ensure that we can have good crowd flow to prevent such incidents from happening.",3,23,014-001-095-076-006-023,118
2022-11-28,Measures to Prevent and Manage Risks from Crowd Surges during Festive Periods and Public Events,014-001-095-076-006,Ms Sun Xueling,"Secondly, I think the Member had filed a question about the use of tear gas. I would be quite specific about this – that the Police will only use riot control agents, which include tear gas, in very specific situations where there is a serious threat of harm to persons and property or the risk of significant public disorder. Just based on recent memory, I do not think there have been recent incidents whereby we use tear gas because we acknowledge that it can cause public chaos. So, another lesson that we have learnt from looking at incidents that happen overseas is that the actions that we take have to be proportionate and we have to be very careful in the way we handle such incidents.",4,24,014-001-095-076-006-024,119

I have Clementi residents who saw what happened at these tragedies elsewhere in the world and were concerned as well. I have two supplementary questions. The first question is, do our agencies look for situations where there may be multiple events, multiple gatherings that individually do not cross the threshold for notification but which may actually lead to a substantial crowd, either by coincidence or by just the organic growth of the crowd around these events and gatherings?",1,26,014-001-095-076-006-026,121

2022-11-28,Measures to Prevent and Manage Risks from Crowd Surges during Festive Periods and Public Events,014-001-095-076-006,Ms Sun Xueling,"One is that it typically happens around specific festivals. So, where there are specific festivals, whether or not it is New Year or Christmas, I think our Police are on quite high alert and they know that there are, historically, venues that crowds will gather. So, it is not like if, let us say, for example, in a place like Orchard Road, you can have different groups of crowds gathering, each does not cross the threshold of 5,000, but it does not mean that the Police are not doing anything. Because the Police would already be quite well aware that this particular venue is a place where crowds typically can gather and they will gather around specific times of the year; and they would be on standby, there would be Police patrols to ensure that there is law and order and to disperse crowds if necessary.",2,31,014-001-095-076-006-031,126

It is also about how people move in and out of an event. Many of us would have attended National Day Parades and all sorts of other large-scale events before. You would have noticed that we have road diversions and we have had crowd marshals. That will take place both before and after an event.",3,32,014-001-095-076-006-032,127

I have two supplementary questions for the hon Minister of State. First, I wonder whether the Police is minded to develop bespoke regulations to deal with different types of crowds. For example, a crowd at a rock concert would behave differently from a crowd at a place of worship. And this is something that is found in scientific literature and the practical considerations are different.

Indeed, we also do pay attention to the dynamics of the crowd – what kind of people are likely to attend, what kind of fervour or enthusiasm or emotions they will likely display. So, these are already taken into account. When the Police work with the EOs in the first instance to think about how to best manage the crowd.",2,37,014-001-095-076-006-037,132

May I ask the Minister of State, what if there is no one single organiser? For example, at Clarke Quay and Boat Quay, where many pubs organise New Year Countdown events.

Like my earlier response, I believe it was to Dr Tan Wu Meng, we are aware that there are certain venues that typically over festivities, there would be crowds.

The community plays an important role in NParks' marine conservation efforts. For example, in order to help NParks manage the Sisters' Islands Marine Park as a place for all, we set up the Friends of Marine Park (FoMP) community in 2016. It comprises boaters, divers, dive operators,  scientists, fishers, kayakers and education providers – a whole range of community partners from academia, industry and people who use the area for recreation and enjoy the space there.",2,13,014-001-095-076-008-013,180

I have two follow-up supplementary questions. I understand that designating an area as a marine park may be seen as a large step, but there is also various interim measures which have been suggested, for example, in the 2018 Blue Plan. For example, more coordinated and integrated efforts between agencies, designating certain zones as protected, as well as more formal management systems for marine environments like seabeds and foreshores. Is the Ministry considering any of these suggestions, and if so, what is the progress of that?",1,18,014-001-095-076-008-018,185

These studies are therefore specific to each different context. Hence, we continue to look at these studies and consider the findings. At the end of the day, if there are some methodologies which we think would be useful, we could consider that. But at the current moment, we think that what is important is the fact that there is global scientific consensus, as articulated by WHO, that there is significant impact of air pollution on healthcare and health itself, and the costs.

One school of thought is that Mr Labouchere had intended it to be a ""wrecking amendment"", to derail and discredit the entire bill on protection of women and girls. He had that reputation. In fact, he had introduced another amendment to the same bill. Another member of parliament said that Mr Labouchere ""couldn't have been serious in introducing that other amendment."" Academics who have studied the matter have pointed to Mr Labouchere's habitual parliamentary obstructionist technique. He would make spoiling amendments to discredit bills that have been introduced.",9,107,014-001-095-076-017-107,372
2022-11-28,Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No 3) Bill,014-001-095-076-017,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"Another school of thought is that Mr Labouchere was fiercely homophobic and so he introduced the amendment. Mr Labouchere himself gave an explanation in parliament for why he introduced section 11 and his explanation raises more questions than it answered. He said that his amendment was to protect any person from an assault of ""the kind dealt with"" under section 11, whether the person was above, or under, the age of 13 years.",10,108,014-001-095-076-017-108,373
2022-11-28,Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No 3) Bill,014-001-095-076-017,The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam),"After that short explanation, he said that he did not think it was necessary to discuss the proposal at any length because the government was willing to accept it. If we take at face value what Mr Labouchere said in parliament in 1885, then the purpose of section 11 was to prevent an indecent assault by one male against another male. The provision here introduced, which was passed into law, was however much wider than that, including those where the sex acts were done between consenting male adults.",11,109,014-001-095-076-017-109,374

The first was Sodomy. Sodomy was first criminalised under the Buggery Act 1533 during the reign of King Henry VIII. The reason this law was passed is linked to a specific, important, historical event in British history and not because there was any specific intention to make sodomy a crime.",2,116,014-001-095-076-017-116,381

[Please refer to Annex 1.] Prior to 1533, sodomy was considered an offence punished by the church. It was only tried in the Ecclesiastical Courts. In other words, not a crime as defined by the state; it was an offence in a religious context to be dealt with by the church. Members would know that Henry VIII broke with the church in Rome, started the Church of England, with him as the head of the church. He wanted to reduce the power of the church and one of the ways he did that was to reduce the power of the Ecclesiastical Courts. He did that by converting many of the church's canon laws into secular laws. The Buggery Act was one such law that was brought over from the canon laws and made into secular criminal law. That way, the King's courts would deal with the matter and the churches' jurisdiction was removed.",3,117,014-001-095-076-017-117,382
2022-11-28,Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No 3) Bill,014-001-095-076-017,Mr K Shanmugam,"What happened thereafter is also useful to note. His daughter, Mary, was an ardent Catholic. When she became Queen in 1553, she abolished the Buggery Act and moved it back to the Ecclesiastical Courts. Queen Elizabeth, another of Henry's daughter, succeeded Queen Mary five years later in 1558. There were questions on her legitimacy and her claims to the throne. She took several steps to establish her legitimacy. And one of the steps she took was to reduce the role of the church by moving the laws out of canon laws and making them secular laws to show that she was following in her father's footsteps. So, the Buggery Act became secular criminal law again.",4,118,014-001-095-076-017-118,383

This was first introduced under the Vagrancy Act 1898. It was initially intended to target pimps, men who lived off the earnings of female prostitutes.

The UK government appointed a committee known as the Wolfenden Committee in August 1954 to review laws relating to homosexual offences. That committee published a report in 1957. The committee stated that it was not charged to enter into matters of private moral conduct except insofar as they directly affect the public good.

In their view, it was not the function of criminal law to intervene in the private lives of citizens or to seek to enforce any particular pattern of behaviour, further than it was necessary to carry out these three functions.

The Court of Appeal said that the applicants did have locus standi because there was a real and credible threat of future prosecution. The Court of Appeal further added that even if no prosecution was contemplated, the applicants could bring their action, they had standing, because of the very existence of a law which is unconstitutional.

It said that section 377A satisfied that test and did not violate Article 12.

The Court of Appeal said that there was no locus standi because the Attorney-General had said that, absent other factors, there would generally be no prosecution under section 377A, where the conduct was between two consenting adults in a private place. On this basis, the Court of Appeal said that section 377A was unenforceable until the Attorney-General gave clear notice that he intended to enforce section 377A.",76,190,014-001-095-076-017-190,455

It expressly stated that its decision on locus standi will not, for example, prevent the Police from investigating conduct under section 377A. In reality, there is a broad universe of cases where the Police may have to investigate, because before investigating, they might not know exactly what the facts are.

This is the main principle underlying the repeal. I am indebted to the hon Minister Shanmugam for painstakingly reviewing the provision based on materials stretching back to the 16th century.

I hope we see the difference in approach here – on matters of national security, we are careful enough to pick out specific exclusions because there are at least three individual rights that are so important so as to be able to stand up against issues pertaining to national security.",25,304,014-001-095-076-017-304,569

I heard the hon Minister as saying that, the reason why he wants to have such a shield is because we may not know of an argument that can be raised in the future. But we are dealing with fundamental liberties and one of the reasons for having fundamental liberties is to curb excess of power, or have a situation whereby there will be an irrational use of power. As a matter of principle, we should be careful in providing for derogations to fundamental liberties of an individual as it would ordinarily be inimical to the concept of democracy and rule of law.",27,306,014-001-095-076-017-306,571

How can we then protect such a person from being banished? Can the Courts exercise its judicial powers to provide a solution for such a person?

It is stated that Parliament may pass laws which define, regulate, safeguard, support, foster and promote the institution of marriage. On the one hand, that sounds like a clear statement of what Parliament can do. However, with due respect, I am not sure what this sub-article actually achieves, apart from stating the obvious. It is indisputable that under Article 38 of the Constitution, legislative power has already been vested in the Legislature consisting of the President and Parliament. Parliament can pass laws on any subject. In what way then is Article 156(1) meaningful?",8,319,014-001-095-076-017-319,584

The latter two sub-articles seek to prohibit challenges under Part 4 of the Constitution to laws and policies based on the current definition of marriage as between a man and a woman.

It is Part 4 that grants individuals critical protections against abuse of state power, such as ensuring freedom from arbitrary arrest and freedom of religion, and the right to equal protection under the law. These are enshrined in the Constitution for a reason. No doubt, these fundamental liberties may not all be absolute, and some of them have been qualified in the Constitution itself. But if one looks at the existing qualifications, they tend to be scoped tightly and justified on the grounds of national emergencies, security, public order and public health.

Article 4 provides that the Constitution is the supreme law of the land, a point recognised by Minister Masagos earlier. Article 4 provides that laws passed by Parliament that are inconsistent with the Constitution shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void. The Constitution is the fundamental legal safeguard of citizens, to protect them against illegal laws and policies that violate the Constitution. And it is the job of the Courts to assess whether any law is constitutional or not. Earlier, I heard Minister Masagos in his Second Reading speech, and I would humbly submit that it is not the same thing to say that when the Courts is assessing a law for constitutionality, it is intervening in a political space.

As for Articles 156(3) and (4), I am concerned about the Courts being further curtailed in their constitutional duty to check Parliament and the Government.

For example, we have the offence of statutory rape where sex with the minor is criminalised. The minor may have consented, but the law recognises that the minor does not have the maturity to meaningfully consent. And I agree with this. Most of us would.

I really believe it is the source of strength and it is also the source of weakness. Therefore, I do cherish the traditional definition of family. Being a parent for more than 30 years now, and being married for over 32 years, I will say to you, as much as I think I am a good mother, I have realised that my husband and myself play a very important role for our three children.

It is easier for the Government to do nothing – and in fact, politically actually, much easier, especially given how controversial this issue is.

Youths and working professionals have approached me and expressed fears and anxieties with gay activism.

Second, we learn to respect one another from the values we are taught in school and at home.

Hence, this brings about the question of fairness if the definition of family nucleus for a married couple changes. For a need as basic as housing, this becomes a tricky situation. Whom then should be given access to public housing and in a timely manner?",11,742,014-001-095-076-017-742,1007

Similarly, this also does not indicate that those who do not believe or adopt it should ostracise individuals who are different from themselves. Every family, every community, every individual has the right to choose what is comfortable for their lives. But as individuals, regardless of our beliefs and inclination, we should not impress upon others that they must embrace our way of living.

We must recognise that IHLs are not merely factories to churn out economically useful graduates.

Firstly, some students feel that they are treated as economic digits, with IHL decisions made based on a return on their investment. For example, some feel that the reason why infrastructural issues are sometimes not fully addressed is because there is no incentive to improve it. Students are not going to leave in the short run and will be forced to put up with this if they want to finish their education and receive their degrees.",19,21,014-001-095-076-022-021,1123

Many students and faculty perceive insufficient transparency, consultation and co-creation in decision-making. For example, IHL governing boards often have absolute discretion over student union regulations and all decisions made by the IHL. Many students believe that the unions have little ability to seek structural or policy changes, and decisions are often made without consultation. This was shown clearly in the case of the merger of YNC and USP. And when consultations are held, these are often non-binding, with the consequent decision-making being somewhat opaque.",20,22,014-001-095-076-022-022,1124

Typically, senates or president councils have strong representation from senior university administrators and less representation from the faculty rank-and-file. This could be seen as there being little separation between the president or provost and faculty members who can provide oversight. To illustrate this point with a question, do we know how many times other senate members succeeded in making the president or provost reconsider certain decisions in the various incidents I referred to earlier? What roles did university senates play and what roles were they able to play?",28,30,014-001-095-076-022-030,1132

Restructuring and opening up senates to more rank-and-file faculty could improve oversight. One area where this may be helpful is on the issue of academic freedom. I filed a Parliamentary Question on this earlier this year, referring to the results of a survey undertaken among academics, which suggested that there may be a significant proportion of academics in our IHLs who feel concerned about the state of academic freedom here. The survey which, by the way, should be looked into and where further research to validate it should be done in the best interests of cultivating a strong academia here.",29,31,014-001-095-076-022-031,1133

When surveys say that we have not done as well, we do not take it to heart personally, but we always remind ourselves that there is room to improve. But I always remind myself and my team that we should look at all surveys holistically and understand the purpose behind each survey, the scope of the survey and what it really tells us and does not tell us. So, I would suggest that we take all these statistics and surveys very carefully.",5,53,014-001-095-076-022-053,1155

And the difference is because they all measure different things. For us, as a portfolio of institutions, we must have the responsibility and the confidence to know what we are looking for in our IHLs beyond a narrow set of metrics – be it publications in selected journals and so forth. It must also encompass student development, faculty development, how they use their resources well and so forth.

Accountability must mean a fair consideration of the holistic demands across the diversity of students, not only in this generation, not only a select group of stakeholders, but for this generation, across diverse student groups and across different generations.

It may be a failure to share, as the Member has suggested, the considerations. But to suggest that just because some people did not get what they want or have their needs fulfilled is a failure of accountability – that, I think, would not be how you and I would characterise the situation.

In any large organisation, be it in the Government or even in your Town Council or in our Town Councils or in any institutions, we must consider the stakeholder needs of the entire stakeholder group that we are dealing with. Make a considered decision and take leadership, responsibility to explain those decisions.

I would have a slightly nuanced position. I do not think setting a number is necessarily the correct thing. In fact, the correct thing for us to do, and as what we have been doing, is that we take every issue, every feedback seriously, regardless of whether it has reached a certain threshold of numbers. An issue that has many people chiming in to say that that is a good thing, does not necessarily make it the most urgent issue.

We can all agree. We try to help people set up new interest groups and I like this, because I want students to take on leadership responsibilities.

In addition, IMDA has set up an Alternative Dispute Resolution, or ADR Scheme, to further incentivise telecommunication service providers to resolve contractual disputes with their consumers in a timely manner. Hence, IMDA will monitor service performance over time, including various customer service standards, to assess if improvements are made and if high standards are maintained.",3,4,014-001-095-076-028-004,1205

Location data may be used legitimately, including for search and advertisement purposes, such as when it is anonymised before use, or the organisation has obtained consent.

PDPC has outlined specific security measures on location data in the Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT Systems, which organisations are expected to adhere to. For instance, the Guide suggests that organisations could collect approximate location data of users, rather than their exact location. It also suggests that apps provide users with the option to authorise the collection of their location data only when required, rather than on a continuous basis.

2022-11-28,Appeals to Switch from Commercial Bank to HDB Housing Loans,014-001-095-076-042,Mr Desmond Lee,"  From 2019 to 2021, HDB received about 90 appeals per year from HDB homeowners to refinance their housing loans from financial institutions (FIs) to HDB. The appeals were not acceded to, as HDB does not allow the refinancing of housing loans from FIs to HDB.",1,2,014-001-095-076-042-002,1263

Flat buyers who have better financial means can approach FIs for a housing loan. Given HDB’s focus on supporting Singaporeans’ home ownership aspirations, HDB does not seek to compete with FIs in the mortgage financing market, as doing so may dilute the market share of FIs and reduce their willingness to provide mortgage financing for future flat purchases. This may lead to a reduction in financing options available to HDB flat buyers.",2,3,014-001-095-076-042-003,1264

For HDB home owners who have housing loans from FIs and are facing difficulties servicing the loans, we encourage them to approach their lenders early to explore solutions. MND, HDB, MOM and MAS have worked with FIs to establish a standardised workflow to assist such HDB flat owners in distress. This includes working with flat owners on potential loan restructuring solutions, referring them to HDB and social service agencies for assistance, and, where foreclosures are unavoidable, working with flat owners to source for their next accommodation.",3,4,014-001-095-076-042-004,1265

2022-11-28,Effect of Announced Fee and Salary Adjustments on Private Preschool Operators' Sustainability,014-001-095-076-043,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"I would like to clarify that Anchor Operators (AOPs) and Partner Operators (POPs) are private sector players in the preschool market. In particular, the POP scheme allows more small- and medium-sized private operators to join. In return, AOPs and POPs follow prescribed fee caps and quality requirements, such as achieving Singapore Preschool Accreditation Framework (SPARK) certification and ensuring continued professional development of their educators.",2,3,014-001-095-076-043-003,1269

They offer niche programmes and meet other needs and preferences of parents. If such services are valued by parents, the preschool would be able to price its offering higher. The reality is that the key competitive pressure faced by such private preschool players is from other sectors in the economy competing to offer good salaries and careers to the same potential pool of skilled manpower. If the Government did not continue to review the support for AOPs and POPs, the challenge of finding and retaining sufficient manpower would be felt by the entire preschool sector and by parents who would not have affordable quality preschool options.",3,4,014-001-095-076-043-004,1270

These include funding for smart solutions to raise productivity, and preschool support schemes to defray staff training, infrastructure and rental costs. Operators not on the AOP or POP schemes can also participate in sector-wide initiatives, such as ECDA’s Scholarships and Training Awards, the Skills Framework for Early Childhood, and the Professional Development Programme. They can tap on SkillsFuture Singapore and Workforce Singapore’s course fee subsidies and programmes, such as the Career Conversion Programme (CCP), to hire and train mid-career jobseekers.",4,5,014-001-095-076-043-005,1271

Overall, families will enjoy greater access to quality and affordable preschools near their homes as Government-supported preschool capacity expands.

These business facilities comprise taxable facilities with direct GHG emissions exceeding 25,000 tonnes annually and reportable facilities with direct GHG emissions between 2,000 and 25,000 tonnes annually. Taxable facilities and reportable facilities account for about 80% and about 1% of Singapore’s emissions respectively.

2022-11-28,Strategies to Prevent Overcrowding and Risk of Stampede in MRT Stations,014-001-095-076-049,Mr S Iswaran,"  Our rail operators and LTA have in place rail incident management plans which include station-specific crowd control procedures. MRT stations are manned by station staff and monitored by operation control centres on a 24/7 basis. Upon detecting potential build-up of crowds in any part of the station, station managers will trigger a series of crowd control measures to regulate the inflow and outflow of the station. If necessary, operators will contact the relevant Home Team agencies for assistance. Let me give you some examples.",1,2,014-001-095-076-049-002,1290

Meanwhile, operators may also take measures to slow down the crowd movement from the concourse to the platform, such as switching off the escalators or even holding back commuters at the concourse level until the crowd at the platform has eased. If necessary, operators will also temporarily divert commuters to other nearby MRT stations.

2022-11-28,Subsidies for Prime Location Public Flat Owners,014-001-095-076-050,Mr Desmond Lee,"  The Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) model ensures that new public housing built in prime, central locations will remain affordable, accessible and inclusive for Singaporeans.

2022-11-28,Subsidies for Prime Location Public Flat Owners,014-001-095-076-050,Mr Desmond Lee,"As a result of these additional subsidies, PLH flat owners benefit from the opportunity to enjoy an uplift from the price appreciation of these flats when they are sold on the open market, which is typically much higher than other BTO flats in non-prime areas. To mitigate these windfall gains and to ensure equity with other BTO flat owners who are not accorded the additional subsidies, PLH flat owners who choose to sell their flats will have to return to HDB a percentage of the resale price or the valuation of the flat upon the sale of their homes, whichever is the higher.

2022-11-28,Subsidies for Prime Location Public Flat Owners,014-001-095-076-050,Mr Desmond Lee,"For the same reason, the subsidy recovery rate would not vary even if there is a greater-than-expected price appreciation by the time PLH flats exceed their minimum occupation period.

As the vehicle growth rate has been 0% per annum since 2018, the supply of COEs is primarily determined by the number of vehicles deregistered. COE prices reflect the demand and supply for vehicles. Since motor showrooms and vehicle dealerships reopened in June 2020 after the circuit breaker, the demand for all vehicles and, by extension, COEs, has been strong. At the same time, COE supply has decreased over this period due to a lower number of vehicle deregistrations. As a result, COE prices have been increasing.",2,3,014-001-095-076-053-003,1312

HDB provides significant subsidies and grants, so that Singaporeans can consider them as options alongside other affordable flats offered in non-mature estates.",3,4,014-001-095-076-097-004,1477

If the buyers wish to use their CPF savings or a housing loan to pay for the flat purchase, they will need to make a Request for Value to HDB. Cash-over-valuation (COV) arises when the resale price is higher than the market valuation of the flat, as the difference can only be paid in cash. Otherwise, there is no COV. Buyers can decide whether to exercise the OTP for the resale transaction depending on the valuation and any COV payable. Should they choose not to proceed with the transaction, buyers will forgo the option fee of between $1 and $1,000 paid to the seller.",2,3,014-001-095-076-098-003,1481
