This involves the use of metal detectors for person checks, and x-ray screening for their belongings.

I have two supplementary questions  first, why was there no detection of the alleged items in his baggage, given that it was detected when he arrived in Bangladesh? The Second Minister said that no security threat items were discovered. I suppose this does not include gold. Would the diplomat have been allowed to transport that amount of gold, allegedly, through Changi Airport on that day?",1,9,012-002-093-018-005-009,44
2015-04-13,Limits on Transport of Gold and Other Precious Metals In and Out of Singapore,012-002-093-018-005,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member),"Secondly, under the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic Relations, diplomatic bags carried by diplomats are protected from search and seizure. This means they need not pass through security screening. How does the Police ensure that this is not exploited as a security loophole for terrorists or trafficking activities? I am concerned about this because there is no limit to the size of the ""dip bag"" (diplomatic bag), and there have international incidents in the past where ""dip bags"" have been used to smuggle a variety of banned items, including drugs, weapons and even people.",2,10,012-002-093-018-005-010,45
2015-04-13,Limits on Transport of Gold and Other Precious Metals In and Out of Singapore,012-002-093-018-005,Mr S Iswaran,"  Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for his questions. First, gold is not a security threat item, and that is why it was not subjected to a security threat screen. Our officers would conduct a normal security threat screen, and if items such as weapons or suspicious objects, or things like large amounts of cash are detected, then they tend to follow through on further checks, as required by the protocol. So, the Member should be clear that this is the context. There was no lapse in terms of security threat assessment and the checks that go with it, as part of the pre-boarding screening.",1,11,012-002-093-018-005-011,46
2015-04-13,Limits on Transport of Gold and Other Precious Metals In and Out of Singapore,012-002-093-018-005,Mr S Iswaran,"Secondly, the Member talks about diplomatic bags and I think he is getting a few things mixed up here. The ""dip bags"" are separate to the personal bags of diplomats. Diplomatic bags have a certain kind of treatment, but diplomats who are travelling and carrying personal bags are subject to pre-board screening, like all other travellers, as I have said. That is the protocol that is observed, not just in Singapore but internationally, because that is what is necessary to ensure safety in aviation and in travel.",2,12,012-002-093-018-005-012,47

Two points  first, in response to his second point, I am aware that only the ""dip bags"" are excluded from screening. So, my question is  given that these bags are excluded from screening, would that pose a security threat or threat of smuggling of any other items.",1,13,012-002-093-018-005-013,48

2015-04-13,Limits on Transport of Gold and Other Precious Metals In and Out of Singapore,012-002-093-018-005,Mr S Iswaran,"  Madam, on the first question, if there is suspicion or serious suspicion that there is a matter of security threat, then the police and the relevant agencies are not constrained from making the appropriate checks on the various items that may be carried by diplomats. It is an international protocol that we observe. So, any risk that the Member imputes to be associated with such practice is a risk that is internationally acknowledged as well. It is not peculiar to the Singapore regime.",1,15,012-002-093-018-005-015,50
2015-04-13,Limits on Transport of Gold and Other Precious Metals In and Out of Singapore,012-002-093-018-005,Mr S Iswaran,"Secondly, on the amount of gold and whether therefore it would have been allowed to pass, I want to reiterate first the point that we do not have any controls on the quantity of these precious metals, et cetera, that are being exported out of Singapore, and usually there are certain basic conditions that they observe when they do so. The Member should also be aware that it is not uncommon, especially for travellers to certain parts of the world to carry what you and I might consider not insignificant amounts of gold in their personal baggage. If they are able to give a clear explanation that these are their personal effects or for personal consumption purposes, generally they would be allowed to carry on with their travel with those items.",2,16,012-002-093-018-005-016,51

This approach should extend to any event that is to be held in Singapore, particularly one that is associated with a worrying track record of drug abuse. We want a reputation for Singapore to be a place with music festivals where people can enjoy themselves in a safe and trouble-free manner. We welcome music events that can provide such an environment. There are really many events held in Singapore which do not present such drug-related concerns. In fact, in the same week that the FMFA 2015 was supposed to be held in Singapore, there was a sold-out concert at the Sports Hub which attracted an audience of 30,000. This was larger than the estimated daily attendance for the proposed FMFA 2015.",11,12,012-002-093-018-006-012,63

I have one supplementary question for the Minister. As the Minister has explained, currently the CPF pays a floor rate which is actually very attractive considering the current low interest rate scenario, thereby helping CPF members accumulate savings despite the low interest rate environment. So, I would like to ask the Minister, would the Government consider preserving that positive difference between the current floor rates that they are offering to CPF members as the interest rate changes?",1,9,012-002-093-018-007-009,78
2015-04-13,Revising CPF Interest Rates Upwards with Rising Interest Rates,012-002-093-018-007,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Let me ask it again  whether CPF can consider a guaranteed premium rate over market interest rates to at least preserve the current positive differences? Currently, there is a floor rate that is offered. So, despite a very low interest rate offered in the market, there is a floor rate of 2.5% for Ordinary Account, and 4% for the Special Account. But as the interest rate increases, that gap, the positive difference that a CPF member enjoys, is likely to narrow if CPF rates are not adjusted accordingly.",2,10,012-002-093-018-007-010,79

Would the Minister adjust the interest rates of CPF accounts in tandem with the market interest rates, so that CPF members can enjoy a guaranteed positive spread?

Let me take the second question first. There are many ways for individuals to secure PR in Singapore, including young people in the age groups that the Member has indicated. This scheme is just one of a range of possible routes. In fact, the large majority are associated with families because their parents are Singapore citizens or PRs themselves, or because their parents have applied for PR as a family together; and they have come together.

Well, as we have stated before, it is part of a larger talent policy in Singapore, so we keep different routes and options available to us. The Member suggested this is a group that is too young to be considered. There is, in fact, an equally persuasive alternative view, because these young people, by virtue of being embedded in our education system for a significant period of time, living and studying cheek by jowl with Singaporean students, are better integrated, and therefore better able to immerse themselves in our environment.",2,6,012-002-093-018-012-006,115

There are those in a very, very severe disruption who may have to de-train, get down to the track and walk to the station. There are those who are stuck on affected trains. There are those who may be able, even though their trains are affected, to drop off at an interchange station and find their way around, and they are also inconvenienced because the journey is longer even though they can continue to complete the rest of the journey on another train. The difficulty is to find a framework that is fair to all these different parties. Much as we have given thought to it over the last year or so, we have not been able to come up with something that we think applies fairly across to all commuters who are affected.",1,9,012-002-093-018-018-009,185
2015-04-13,Compensation for Commuters Affected by Train and Bus Service Disruptions,012-002-093-018-018,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"We look at the MTR practice in Hong Kong. It is for same-day compensation of a 10% discount on a second trip. And if the disruption takes place in the late evening peak hour, for example, then it is a compensation that may not make as much sense as it would, if it had happened in the morning. Even when we look at these different examples, there is no perfect solution that we think is applicable to our case.",2,10,012-002-093-018-018-010,186

But the fines help, in a sense that it goes towards the Public Transport Fund, and out of the Public Transport Fund, we provide support to those who need it most, meaning the lower-income who are affected every time we have a fare adjustment. This is why we have been able, over the last two fare exercises, to put up to about $7.5 million each time in terms of vouchers to the lower-income families, and this in part comes out from the fines that are paid by the operators into the Public Transport Fund.",3,11,012-002-093-018-018-011,187

Because our SMEs are growing and there are also more of them are going overseas, they are earning international revenue and, therefore, they have more foreign exchange exposure. And so, if you talk to the banks, all of them are indeed expanding their suite of solutions and services to meet their small business customers, particularly with regard to managing foreign exchange transactions and risks.",1,8,012-002-093-018-019-008,199

It is not so much the lack of services but the issue of a lack of knowledge and in-house skills within the SMEs, and that means really going out to reach out to the SMEs, providing more courses or helping them to understand how to even quantify their FX exposure to begin with, and then helping them to understand what are the different options out there in order for them to hedge their foreign exchange risks, whether it is through a bank solution, whether it is through a futures contract, or for that matter, through a natural hedge, because you do it in a low-cost manner through a natural hedge by holding a basket of foreign exchange currencies. There are different solutions and I think that is the biggest gap that I think we need to address. As I have said earlier, there are many agencies – SPRING, ASME as well as the banks and SGX – offering different workshops and courses to SMEs to help them raise their awareness level.",2,9,012-002-093-018-019-009,200

The barrier to entry is low and caters to those looking for recreational sports. Those seeking more competitive sports can also participate in inter-faculty games at the PSEIs, or the annual inter-institution games, including the Singapore Universities Games (SUNiG), the Inter-Varsity Polytechnic Games (IVP) as well as the Polytechnic-Institute of Technical Education (POL-ITE) Games. These programmes and activities are often free, if not heavily subsidised, to ensure that the cost of sports participation is kept as low as possible. Students also have access to a wide range of facilities at the PSEIs to pursue sports at their own time and in line with their own interests.",5,6,012-002-093-018-024-006,244

People prayed for, grieved over and paid their last respects to the founding father who had done so much to create today's Singapore. Many wrote touching messages in condolence books and cards, and made special tribute books and items. During the Special Session of Parliament, Members spoke movingly about Mr Lee's contributions, what he meant to them, and their personal experiences of him.

Mr Lee made it very clear throughout his life that he did not need and did not want any monument. It was not monuments but ideals that were his chief concern; the ideals upon which he built Singapore  multi-racialism, equality, meritocracy, integrity, and the rule of law. He hoped these ideals would endure in Singapore beyond him. We can pay no greater tribute to him than to uphold the principles upon which he built this country.",5,5,012-002-093-018-025-005,255
2015-04-13,"Honouring the Founding Prime Minister of Singapore, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew",012-002-093-018-025,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"Mr Lee was very careful when it came to lending his name to institutions and awards. When he consented, it was for causes that he was passionate about and where using his name served a greater purpose. He was intent on showing his support for the cause or institution, rather than using the honour to glorify himself. For example, on his 80th birthday, he agreed that NUS should create a Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. Cabinet had discussed this carefully and had convinced him that having such a school, and associating his name with it, would help establish the Singapore brand of governance and advance the school's mission – to raise standards of governance in Asia, to improve the lives of people and to contribute to the transformation of the region. For the same reason, he supported NTU when it named its school of international studies after his old comrade, Mr S Rajaratnam, and the SAF when it named the command and staff college after Dr Goh Keng Swee. Similarly, the Lee Kuan Yew Water Prize honours contributions towards solving the world's water challenges, because water, in the Singapore context, was a lifelong obsession of his. And the various education awards in his name are to encourage students at all levels and of all abilities to strive for all round excellence. One of his recent contributions to education for awards was the Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism and this focusses on Mother Tongue learning. He paid close attention to this issue all his life, not just as a policy matter, but as someone who learnt Mandarin the hard way as an adult and kept up the effort till his last days.",6,6,012-002-093-018-025-006,256

He was exceptional in this respect among post-colonial leaders and founders of countries.

He did have his portrait painted and his bust made in his lifetime, but he did not allow them to be displayed publicly and I know of only two exceptions to this. After he stepped down from Cabinet in 2011, a bust of him, which had been made many years ago in the early 1980s by Sydney Harpley, who is a British sculptor and who did the Girl on a Swing and other sculptures which are in the Botanic Gardens, was displayed in Parliament House. There is another bust of Mr Lee, made by French sculptor Nacera Kainou, which is displayed at the Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities in the Singapore University of Technology and Design, with his permission.

He said, talking about Oxley Road, that ""it should not be kept as a kind of relic"". He said that he had seen too many other houses of famous people ""kept frozen in time … as a monument with people tramping in and out"". They invariably ""become shabby"", in his words.

May I ask the Prime Minister whether he will consider favourably the request by many Singaporeans to name our airport after Mr Lee Kuan Yew? Was it not Mr Lee Kuan Yew who decided to relinquish Paya Lebar Airport and to change to Changi in the mid-1970s in spite of the consultants at that time not recommending it, and in spite of a reluctant Cabinet because of the cost of relocating plus a loss of the $800-million investment already put into Paya Lebar Airport? Does the naming of this remind generations to come, Mr Lee's always forward-looking vision plus the good value of bearing short-term pain for long-term gain?",1,40,012-002-093-018-025-040,290
2015-04-13,"Honouring the Founding Prime Minister of Singapore, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew",012-002-093-018-025,Dr Lily Neo,"I also like to ask the Prime Minister whether he is in agreement that a strong Singapore currency associated with a successful Singapore is a legacy attributable to our first Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew who built a successful nation based on what he said earlier, meritocracy, multiracialism, incorruptibility and a fair and just society. Thus, by having his picture on our currency notes, it will remind present and future generations on his important fundamental principles that have worked for us as we handle the notes each day.",2,41,012-002-093-018-025-041,291

But I hesitate to make decisions on them now. It is two weeks since the state funeral and three weeks since Mr Lee passed away. I think we need some time to pass, we need to have some overall sense of perspective and history, and then there is time enough for us to make these commitments and decisions to honour him, not just in the next few months but really in the next few decades.",1,42,012-002-093-018-025-042,292

But on a national basis, a memorial may be 50 years later, may be 70 years, may be several generations later. And then your position, your historical place is clear and emerges, perhaps, in sharper focus.

Mr Lee had got a lot to do with Changi Airport. He had a lot to do with our having a currency which is worth the paper on which it is printed. He had a lot to do with many other things, too – the Singapore River, the greening of Singapore. If we want to name things after him, there is no shortage of things which are suitable. I would say, let us take our time. Let us focus, in the first instance, on this idea of how should we remember our founders, not just Mr Lee, but the core founding fathers of the country.

And in fact, multi-racialism was the reason why Singapore became Singapore as an independent republic. Therefore, I was very moved, during the period of National Mourning, that many minority Singaporeans expressed in the newspapers and wrote to me to say how grateful they were that they were born in Singapore, and not as a minority somewhere else. And how in Singapore, they had seen equal opportunities and they have had full chance to develop and their careers had in no way been hindered and they stand tall like everybody else.",1,48,012-002-093-018-025-048,298

For minority Singaporeans, really, the way to honour Mr Lee is not to have a minority celebration, but a joint effort to participate fully in the national effort to do what we are trying to do.

Many Singaporeans have many suggestions on how to honour the late Mr Lee. For Singapore who has gone through the National Mourning period, there is something very special and dear to remember.

It is on the Committee that is being set up under Mr Lee Tzu Yang. I support the proposal, but its remit seems to be rather narrow, focused in the Founders' Memorial. As there has been a great movement towards wanting to preserve our memories and the past for future generations, can I ask the Prime Minister whether he could widen the remit to consider the various proposals put up by the public and also to involve curators, historians and heritage specialists? As the Prime Minister said, there needs to be a detachment of time but also a detachment of emotion in going through all the proposals and deciding which ones should be kept, with a clear view that this is for the future generations.",4,57,012-002-093-018-025-057,307

We have to let time pass; we have to let perspectives emerge gradually over the years and decades. What we can do is to focus on one possible promising direction, which is a Founders' Memorial and an education gallery somehow linked it, perhaps co-located, but anyway linked to it.

The first, under new section 26A, permits entry with a warrant obtained from the court. The second, under new section 26B, permits entry without need for a court warrant, if there are reasonable grounds for believing that there is an imminent danger from within the flat which would affect public health or public safety.

2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Desmond Lee,"  Thank you, Madam. In June 2013, a Bishan homeowner and his friend removed part of a structural column while renovating the flat, as you can see it on the LED screen. The owner did not even apply for a renovation permit from HDB. Had he done so, HDB would have told him right away that he could not demolish the structural column because it was critical to the structural integrity of the building. Fortunately, a concerned resident alerted HDB about this. HDB engineers rushed in to prop up the affected beams, and worked throughout the night to reinstate the column. The home owner was prosecuted in court, convicted and fined. His reckless act may have endangered an entire block of residents.",1,11,012-002-093-018-030-011,347

You can see, I think, two of them here [referring to the slides on the LED screen]. This is strictly not allowed, because the RC walls serve as supporting structures of the building. Again, HDB engineers had to rush in to carry out urgent repair works. The contractor was prosecuted, convicted and fined. In both cases, fortunately, the owners had the good sense to allow HDB officers to enter their flats to conduct emergency repair. Had the owners refused entry, for whatever reason, HDB could have been caught in a legal grey zone, and many residents would have been placed in unnecessary danger.",2,12,012-002-093-018-030-012,348

They must be able to investigate and rectify the situation without delay. New section 26B will give HDB the power to enter the flat for such repair works without the need to apply for a warrant. Members will agree with me that imposing a statutory requirement for HDB to only enter the flat with a court warrant will lose precious hours, when there is severe risk to life and property.",3,13,012-002-093-018-030-013,349
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Desmond Lee,"Let me now explain the need for section 26A, which gives HDB power to enter a flat, with a court warrant, for urgent repair works. This will help to address cases, for example, where ceiling leaks have become serious and urgent, which can be a source of distress and frustration or potential danger for some HDB residents if not resolved quickly.",4,14,012-002-093-018-030-014,350
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Desmond Lee,"Currently, when HDB receives feedback from residents on ceiling leaks, HDB will help them seek their upper-floor neighbours' cooperation to investigate and to repair the leak, if they have not already done so. HDB also helps to carry out the investigations to identify the cause of the leaks, on a goodwill basis. Most upper-floor neighbours are mindful of the inconvenience that their lower-floor neighbours face, and will agree to the repairs once they are told of this. To facilitate repairs and early resolution of the leak, HDB has implemented a Goodwill Repair Assistance (GRA) Scheme to assist lessees to repair the ceiling leak and to co-pay 50% of the cost of repairing the leak. While the GRA Scheme has helped many flat owners resolve leak problems effectively and at a subsidised cost, HDB has encountered some upper-floor neighbours who refuse to co-operate and delay the repair unnecessarily. Over the last four years, on an average per year, one in four cases takes more than four months to resolve.",5,15,012-002-093-018-030-015,351
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Desmond Lee,"For such cases, HDB will engage the upper-floor neighbours a number of times to seek their cooperation to carry out the repairs. Grassroots leaders may also be asked to step in to persuade them to cooperate. If all these efforts fail, HDB will have no choice then but to take legal action and apply for a Court Order to compel the upper-floor neighbours to carry out the repairs within a specified period. From 2012 to 2014, HDB took legal action against 400 households, after it exhausted all efforts to engage and persuade the upper-floor neighbours to cooperate. But this process of reaching resolution is protracted and can take up to 12 months. In the meantime, the delay could cause the leak to worsen and spread or result in severe spalling concrete, inconveniencing and, in some cases, even endangering the safety of the lower-floor neighbours. We hear of many cases of residents who are frustrated and who hope that HDB can do more to help them.",6,16,012-002-093-018-030-016,352
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Desmond Lee,"Let me cite two actual cases to give Members a sense of the circumstances where we envisage section 26A may be used. In the first case, in Yishun, the ceilings in the master bedroom toilet and kitchen toilet were leaking so badly and for such a long time that stalactites had started to form in the toilets. You can see it on the right [referring to the slides on the LED screen].The leaks had also resulted in spalling concrete on the ceiling where the reinforcement bars had been exposed. Imagine the inconvenience and anxiety of the lower-floor residents. Should the spalling concrete deteriorate further, loose chunks of concrete, small, large, could fall and hurt the occupants. The case remains unresolved since it was reported to HDB in June 2012, and HDB is still trying to resolve this.",7,17,012-002-093-018-030-017,353
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Desmond Lee,"In the second case, this time in Bukit Batok, the leak from the kitchen ceiling was so severe that the lower-floor residents had to perpetually place pails in the kitchen to collect the water. Similar to the Yishun case, stalactites had formed on the kitchen ceiling. What started as ceiling leak in the kitchen, because it was not resolved, had also spread to other walls in the living room. For these two cases, HDB and the local grassroots leaders had tried tirelessly to help these residents by persuading the upper-floor neighbours to cooperate, but were met with limited success. It took almost two years for this case to be resolved.",8,18,012-002-093-018-030-018,354
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Desmond Lee,"The proposed power of entry with a warrant will allow HDB to better help those suffering from serious ceiling leaks, among other things. Prior to HDB's application for a court warrant for entry, HDB will give the relevant unit 24-hours' notice at least. Should they still refuse to cooperate, HDB may then apply to court for a warrant to enter the flat to investigate the leak and carry out repairs.",9,19,012-002-093-018-030-019,355
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Desmond Lee,"We are mindful that the proposed powers to enter a flat without the owner's permission can be perceived as a drastic measure. Let me assure this House that HDB will only do so as a last resort, after exhausting all other avenues to get the owner's cooperation. HDB will use these powers sparingly, and judiciously.",10,20,012-002-093-018-030-020,356

The Bill mandates that only officers authorised by the Board are empowered to enter the flat to investigate and to carry out repair. The officers will be required to show proof of identity to the lessees or occupiers. There will be at least one HDB officer present in the flat during the investigation and repair work, and the officer will be required to show proof of identity to the owners or occupiers of the flat.",11,21,012-002-093-018-030-021,357

2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Desmond Lee,"From time to time, some HDB homeowners will hire contractors to renovate their flats to suit their lifestyles, tastes and preferences. To ensure that these renovation contractors do not unintentionally, in the course of their work, damage the block or compromise the structural integrity of the building, HDB has in place, since 1975, a Registered Renovation Contractors' (RRC) Scheme to regulate renovation works carried out by renovation contractors in HDB flats. Flat owners who wish to renovate their flats must engage RRCs, who are qualified contractors and should be familiar with HDB's requirements for carrying out renovations. To complement the RRC Scheme, HDB has also put in place a demerit point system and they could also be debarred from carrying out future renovation works in HDB flats.",13,23,012-002-093-018-030-023,359

In 2006, HDB further enacted Rules to govern how renovations should be carried out in HDB flats. Renovation contractors, including those not registered under the RRC Scheme, as well as flat owners would be held accountable for breaches to these Rules. If convicted in court, they face a fine of up to $5,000.",14,24,012-002-093-018-030-024,360
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Desmond Lee,"While the absolute number of unauthorised renovation works remains small, we observe a gradual increase. In 2014, there were five cases of major structural infringements, compared to three cases in 2005. Overall, for the 10-year period from 2005 to 2014, there were over 60 cases of both major and minor infringements.",15,25,012-002-093-018-030-025,361
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Desmond Lee,"We are concerned about this increase in numbers, because any compromise to the structural integrity of HDB blocks can have catastrophic consequences. Hence, clause 4 of the Bill will amend section 27, to do three things. First, any security deposit placed by the RRC for contravening any obligation imposed on the RRC in the permit may be forfeited. Second, HDB may impose a financial penalty not exceeding $10,000 on errant renovation contractors and flat owners for contravening any condition of a licence, the contravention of which does not amount to an offence. And third, the penalty against errant renovation contractors, including those not registered with HDB, and flat owners will be raised, by increasing the maximum court fine from $5,000 to $20,000 and providing the courts with an option to impose an imprisonment term of up to one year.",16,26,012-002-093-018-030-026,362

2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Desmond Lee,"HDB stipulates a set of conditions in each lease agreement for two main reasons. First, they ensure that HDB flats are used for its intended purpose. The Home Ownership Scheme was introduced in 1964 to enable Singaporeans to own their homes, and have a stake in the country's future. Thus, HDB flats are highly subsidised, and are meant primarily for owner occupation. To ensure that this system is not abused, potential buyers must meet certain eligibility criteria, such as citizenship requirements and household income before they can apply for an HDB flat. In addition, lessees must live in their flats for a minimum period before they can sell or sublet their whole flat. Second, HDB also plays a key role in building communities and fostering neighbourly ties in our public housing estates. The conditions in the lease agreement facilitate this by spelling out appropriate behaviour, so that all residents can enjoy a pleasant living environment in a densely populated city.",18,28,012-002-093-018-030-028,364
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Desmond Lee,"From time to time, however, some flat owners have abused the system. Most commonly, flat owners contravene the lease terms such as the five-year Minimum Occupation Period (MOP), and sublet their whole flat without obtaining HDB's approval to do so. HDB has also encountered cases of flat owners using their homes as illegal gambling dens, or as illegal worker dormitories, which create an undesirable and sometimes unsafe living environment for genuine HDB residents.",19,29,012-002-093-018-030-029,365
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Desmond Lee,"Under the Act today, HDB may compulsorily acquire a flat, vest a flat or terminate the lease of a flat. Under the Rules, HDB may impose a penalty instead of compulsorily acquiring the flat. However, HDB is unable, at this time, to vary the magnitude of the penalty to make it proportionate to the severity of the infringement in some cases, even if there are good reasons to do so. This puts HDB in a very difficult position  should it exercise compulsory acquisition, which can be draconian and traumatic to the home owner, or should it impose a penalty that it feels may be out of proportion to the severity of the infringement in that particular case? In some of such cases, the practical reality is that HDB has erred on the side of compassion and waived the penalty in full. But this is not ideal, and can create a moral hazard.",20,30,012-002-093-018-030-030,366
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Desmond Lee,"To set this right, clause 12 of the Bill amends section 65 of the Act to allow HDB to impose a variable range of penalties, not exceeding $50,000, instead of compulsory acquisition or vesting of the flat, depending on the severity of the infringement under sections 47, 55 and 56 of the Act. With these amendments, HDB can now implement a calibrated penalty framework instead of being faced with the stark choice of compulsory acquisition on the one hand or a fixed quantum penalty on the other.",21,31,012-002-093-018-030-031,367

2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Desmond Lee,"As I have explained earlier, HDB takes a serious view of the misuse of public housing.

The misuse of flats can cause disamenities to fellow residents, and HDB needs to be able to investigate suspected cases of misuse and take appropriate action where necessary.",23,33,012-002-093-018-030-033,369
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Desmond Lee,"Today, HDB's powers to conduct a thorough investigation into suspected lease infringements are limited. From time to time, HDB officers meet resistance from flat owners. Some have refused to cooperate with HDB. Others go so far as to challenge HDB's right to investigate the matter. However, HDB is not able to compel flat owners to cooperate with the investigation. This makes it very difficult for HDB officers to carry out their public duty.",24,34,012-002-093-018-030-034,370

New section 56A authorises HDB officers to enter and search any flat or other premises that the owner or occupier may be residing in, and record evidence in the form of photographs, videos and audio. As a safeguard, the Act requires HDB to first obtain a warrant from the court. The officer must also identify himself to the flat owner or occupier, and show him the court warrant as well as official proof of identity.

Clause 9 widens this and introduces three additional circumstances under which HDB can deposit the compensation in Court so that HDB will not have to hold on to the compensation monies indefinitely.

HDB, together with other agencies, visited the unit during day and night but there was no response from the occupier. There was a concern that the structural integrity of the building might be compromised as some occupants in the block mentioned that they could feel the vibration from their units. But the occupant refused to allow anyone to enter the flat. Eventually, HDB managed to enter the flat with the help of the Police and found that the occupant had been knocking part of the two walls with a wooden plank.

It occurs when water from the upper floor unit leaks into the ceiling of the lower floor through the concrete floor slab. As an MP, over the years, I have had residents approach me to give feedback about how they had to deal with persistent ceiling leak problems. While most neighbours are cooperative and take steps to fix the leak to their neighbour's flat below, there are others who do not act, perhaps because the leak does not affect them directly, or they may have other reasons, for example, a sick family member or an expectant wife.",10,55,012-002-093-018-030-055,391

In the case of ceiling leaks, both the upstairs and downstairs units are collectively responsible to fix the leak. HDB's Goodwill Repair Assistance scheme is helpful in absorbing half of the costs.

HDB flats are primarily meant for owner occupation, but there are owners who try to circumvent the HDB's rules by locking up one room and subletting the flat without physically staying in it. They are subletting their flats in an unauthorised manner and should not be allowed to continue. I am glad that the Ministry is looking into enhancing HDB's levers of investigation and enforcement against lease infringements, including illegal subletting. HDB officers must be able to investigate fully and take effective enforcement action against unauthorised or illegal activity. Hence, I strongly support giving HDB officers enhanced powers of investigation so that they can build up a strong case to take errant lessees to task.",14,59,012-002-093-018-030-059,395

I urge them to put themselves in the shoes of the lower-floor residents or neighbours.

The right to do so must come with some precautionary measures. First of all, there needs to be established, a protocol that determines when it is necessary to exercise this authority. Surely all viable options must be exhausted before the HDB can consider it. A suitable deadline for the occupant to take action must also be established. How long does he or she have to call in a plumber before HDB takes action? The HDB officers must make efforts to give ample advance notice, ensuring that the recipient is aware, before they simply turn up at the resident's house. Preferably this can be done by phone calls and letters. The proposed Bill cites that the Board must give the occupant at least a 24-hour notice of its intention to enter the premises. I believe we could perhaps extend this to 48 hours, unless the damage is potentially life-threatening.",19,64,012-002-093-018-030-064,400

Are these matters so serious that they warrant legislation before they can be resolved? When I was young, having neighbours help each other out was very common. Everyone would reach out to help whichever household needed assistance. Whenever we patronised the kopitiam, the proprietors would remember which customers preferred to have less sugar in their coffee, and whose children attended which schools; if we went to the neighbourhood provision shop to buy soya sauce, we would always linger to chat with the proprietors. This frequent interaction among neighbours, watching out for each other and helping one another, was part and parcel of the kampung spirit we always talk about.",2,70,012-002-093-018-030-070,406

This has been a major contribution to social development.

If the Zhang family's ceiling springs a leak, they would simply go upstairs to the Tan family's flat to take a look. Legislation would not be necessary. It is a different story now. Residents seldom interact even if they live in the same building, and are not familiar with one another. They do not know each other's surnames, professions, and do not talk though they may take the same lift. Relations are quite estranged. If there is any knock on the door, residents would speak from behind their iron gates and be very guarded. Hence, we need to amend the Bill to give HDB officials more empowerment.

Different generations have different focuses in their life, and the social functions of neighbourhood shops and public facilities also need to adapt to the changing times. Unlike the supermarkets and large shopping centres, neighbourhood shops can create a congenial meeting place for all residents, and they need to adjust their business model according to the residents' composition and lifestyle patterns to provide even more unique products and services.

HDB needs to be even more forward-looking in their design concepts, and correspondingly there needs to be mutual support and coordination amongst the Town Councils, Citizens' Consultative Committees, Community Development Councils, Community Centres and Residents' Committees. Shop owners need to consider ways to do their business better and should actively support the Merchants' Associations. The leadership of the Merchants' Associations needs to demonstrate team spirit in strategic planning and come up with innovative ideas and marketing concepts unique to their areas.

2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"  Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill.",1,100,012-002-093-018-030-100,436
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"A key feature of the Bill is the power of entry for HDB for investigation and urgent repairs. For many long-suffering residents whose neighbours have been uncooperative or worse, acting in violation of the law, this measure is overdue and provides much welcomed assurance of safety and security.",2,101,012-002-093-018-030-101,437
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"In cases where there are looming dangers such as structural damages where the safety of residents is at stake, HDB's right to access the problematic units is undisputable. With the amendment, HDB will no longer require a court warrant and necessary action can be taken immediately.",3,102,012-002-093-018-030-102,438
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I would like to ask the Minister  how many of such cases have occurred in recent years; which are the most common hazards, and what measures are in place to prevent the recurrence of such incidents?",4,103,012-002-093-018-030-103,439
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"On the other hand, where the situations are not quite as dire, such as a ceiling leak, there are some criticisms about the proposal to allow entry with court warrants in cases where owners ignore a 24-hour notice period and had not allowed for HDB staff entry.",5,104,012-002-093-018-030-104,440
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Some feel that such a measure is heavy handed. Others worry about abuse of such powers. The critics in the first group may not be aware of the severity of this problem. As the Minister of State had shared before, each year alone, there are about 2,800 ceiling-leak cases which take more than three months to resolve.",6,105,012-002-093-018-030-105,441
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"In addition, every year, HDB have to take about 120 flat owners to court to compel them to provide access to their flats for investigation and repairs.",7,106,012-002-093-018-030-106,442
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),It is important for the Ministry to highlight to all HDB owners that the 24-hour notice is only given in cases where the flat owners have been persistently uncooperative. It would be useful for HDB to clarify what constitutes uncooperative behaviour.,8,107,012-002-093-018-030-107,443
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Would the Ministry elaborate on what actions HDB has to take and exhaust before it acts to force the flat owner to allow access to carry out the investigation and repair works? How long will the whole process take before forced entry is made as a last resort, as pointed out by other Members in the House?",9,108,012-002-093-018-030-108,444
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"What would happen if the owners need a longer time to accede to the request due to, for example, medical reasons, but the owners of the unit below cannot accommodate? Or if the owners of the upper floor unit claim that they cannot comply at all due to medical concerns? There may also be cases where the owners are away for extended periods or are, so-called ""uncontactable"". What alternatives are available to HDB officers?",10,109,012-002-093-018-030-109,445
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I would like to suggest that HDB conduct thorough investigations of affected units to ensure that causes of problems originating from other sources are excluded before approaching the suspected units. For example, there had been cases where the ceiling leaks tend to occur only on rainy days because they were caused by cracks in external walls on the upper floor, not from the upper floor unit per se. Sharing information about such prior investigations with the owners of the units above will assure them that they are not being inconvenienced unnecessarily.",11,110,012-002-093-018-030-110,446
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),I would also like to ask what would happen if the remedial works still fail to rectify problems. Would the owners still need to pay for additional costs of further investigations? What if further investigations reveal that an errant diagnosis is due to a HDB contractor?,12,111,012-002-093-018-030-111,447
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Presently, HDB bears half of the repair costs of leakages and spalling concrete, with the other half shared equally by upper- and lower-floor flat owners. Generally, flat owners pay about $180 for each ceiling-leak repair. Despite this heavily subsidised price, there are owners who face financial hardship and cannot afford to pay. Does HDB have assistance schemes in place to help such families to pay for such expenses?",13,112,012-002-093-018-030-112,448
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Another important advantage of allowing HDB officers to enter flats with warrants is that we now have another tool to stamp out the illegal subletting of flats or their use for non-residential purposes. Presently, owners and tenants can refuse to let HDB officers enter their flats to investigate lease infringements. Many of such cases include overcrowding leading to disturbances and an unsafe environment for the neighbours. Hence, I am in full support of providing our enforcement officers with this new tool for a safer neighbourhood. Let me continue and conclude in Mandarin.",14,113,012-002-093-018-030-113,449
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.]   I support this Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill. On the surface, provisions of the Bill may appear to be giving HDB officers excessive power to enter HDB flats which are suspected to have problems to conduct investigation and repair. However, the HDB would only do so as the last resort.",15,114,012-002-093-018-030-114,450
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Every year, there are as many as 2,800 cases of ceiling leak cases which take more than three months to resolve. In some cases, it may take even more than a year to be dealt with. And there are more than 100 households who refuse to cooperate and HDB has to apply for a court warrant in order to enter the unit to investigate. This is time-consuming and taxpayer's money is wasted.",16,115,012-002-093-018-030-115,451
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Some residents are worried that after the Bill is amended, some people may pose as HDB officers and coerce the residents into opening their doors for them to get in. Although HDB has reminded the residents to verify that they are HDB officers, but some residents say that they cannot tell whether the documents are genuine are not. And they are also concerned whether their privacy could be preserved.",17,116,012-002-093-018-030-116,452
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol),I hope that the Minister could take into account these concerns and worries of the residents and put forward the relevant measures that HDB is going to take. Thank you.,18,117,012-002-093-018-030-117,453
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"  Mdm Speaker, thank you for this opportunity to speak on the proposed Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill.",1,118,012-002-093-018-030-118,454
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"Having lived in a low-floor HDB unit for 10 years, I can fully appreciate the distress and anxiety suffered when flat owners experience cracks on ceiling or walls, and water leakages, be it in our bedrooms, kitchen or living room, causing damage to our furniture and fittings. I remember at least two occasions when the unit directly above mine did major renovation works for months, which created some concerns for us. In such a situation, we would have been grateful to have a hotline for us to report any damages or leakages in our unit, and would have appreciated that such problems are resolved promptly. With the proposed amendment, HDB will be able to do more to help residents resolve such problems quickly.",2,119,012-002-093-018-030-119,455
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"Madam, with this Bill, HDB will have greater powers in entering premises, with or without a warrant, to investigate and to carry out urgent repairs. But I feel that central to this amendment, first and foremost should be the residents' well-being and safety, and not so much to make it more convenient or easier for HDB to carry out their work. I also feel that giving more power to HDB to gain access to residents' flats is a double-edge sword because, on the one hand, it can please residents whose problems get resolved, but on the other hand, it can upset those who are unhappy with the intrusion or who feel unfairly treated. I therefore hope that HDB look carefully and thoroughly into residents' concerns, address them in a fair manner and ensure that with these new powers, HDB gain more trust from the public instead of more distrust.",3,120,012-002-093-018-030-120,456
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"Madam, from the standpoint of residents, there are a few concerns, some of which have already been raised by hon Members previously, and I hope for some clarifications on these areas.",4,121,012-002-093-018-030-121,457
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"First, is on communicating to the public on the need and intent of the Bill. A home is a sanctuary and I think residents will have concerns on invasion of their privacy. Hence, HDB should clarify on the circumstances where such an enforced entry is warranted and why it is justified, so that the general public can clearly understand the need for such enforced entry.",5,122,012-002-093-018-030-122,458
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"Secondly, occupants that are present during the enforced entry should be treated with dignity and decorum. This could be a living-in maid, an elderly, the incapacitated or a child who may feel intimidated by the presence of officials.",6,123,012-002-093-018-030-123,459
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"I hope HDB implements a code of conduct on the behaviour of the officers in engaging occupants present during the enforced entry, so as not to cause undue distress to these persons. It is also ideal to have officers who can converse in dialect or ethnic Mother Tongue to communicate with non-English speaking occupants.",7,124,012-002-093-018-030-124,460
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"My third concern is the probability that this amendment will create an opportunity for criminals to gain access to residents' premises. I think there is a danger that parties with criminal intent may take the opportunity to gain access to premises which may then result in undesired and serious consequences. It may be worthwhile to consider providing a hotline for owners or occupants to verify the identity of the officials. Owners or occupants should be encouraged to verify the identity of officials and the purpose of gaining entry, as identity cards and documents can be forged and can fool unsuspecting residents.",8,125,012-002-093-018-030-125,461
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"My fourth concern is on potential dispute on costs of repairs. The Bill states that HDB will claim from the owner the costs incurred in the repairs. For costly bills, this may be problematic. The owner may dispute that he or she was not consulted on the potential costs of the repair work and may not have the funds to pay for it. How then will HDB handle such a scenario?",9,126,012-002-093-018-030-126,462
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"The fifth concern is damages done as a result of enforced entry. The Amendment Bill states that HDB is not liable to compensate the owner for any losses incurred due to the damage done at the premises. I think this is an area that may cause much unhappiness to residents as it appears unfair to owners who may not be aware of HDB's intention to enforce entry. Can HDB explain the basis for this and will HDB consider on a case-to-case basis to compensate owners, for example, in hardship cases?",10,127,012-002-093-018-030-127,463
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"Finally, can HDB explain the justification for the 24-hour notice, which I find, just like other Members here, to be too short? Will HDB consider a longer notice period to give owners more time to respond? Madam, in Malay, please.",11,128,012-002-093-018-030-128,464
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"(In Malay)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.]   Sometimes, we are unfortunate enough to experience cracks on walls or the ceiling of our HDB flats, spalling concrete or water leakages because of renovation work done by our neighbours. In such situations, what can flat owners do? With the proposed changes to the Housing and Development Act, HDB will have greater powers to gain entry into HDB flats to investigate the cause of the problems and to undertake repairs urgently. This is beneficial to residents and residents should take advantage of this change by proactively alerting HDB of renovation works which may jeopardise the structural integrity of the building and create danger for residents.",12,129,012-002-093-018-030-129,465
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"However, there will be some occupants who may not be comfortable to let in strangers even if they are HDB officers, especially if the flat owner is not around and have given them instructions to not allow these officers into the premises. In such situations, I hope HDB officers will be mindful to engage occupants with due respect and give occupants proper assurances.",13,130,012-002-093-018-030-130,466
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"Aside from empowering HDB with the power to enter premises with or without a warrant, there are other areas which I hope HDB can provide more clarification. One of the clauses states that HDB will be able to claim the cost of repairs from owners. I think this may create a problem, especially if the flat owners were not consulted and the cost turned out to be high. Another clause states that HDB is not liable to compensate the owner for any losses incurred due to damages done at the premises. For both these scenarios, I hope the Ministry can reconsider and provide assistance to cover the cost partially, if not wholly, for those who may have difficulty to cope with the expenses.",14,131,012-002-093-018-030-131,467
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),Another concern I have is the possibility that criminals may pose as HDB officers to gain access to flats and commit a crime. I hope there are sufficient education efforts and safeguards to protect residents from those who may take advantage of unsuspecting residents.,15,132,012-002-093-018-030-132,468
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member),"(In English)  Madam, I would conclude in English, please. While I support the Bill, I hope HDB will provide clarifications on some of the concerns that have been raised today and give the public greater assurance that the well-being of the public is at the heart of these proposed amendments. Thank you.",16,133,012-002-093-018-030-133,469
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"  Mdm Speaker, many hon Members of the House would have experienced residents' complaints about ceiling leakage issues taking months to resolve. A quick check of my mailbox revealed two latest incidents. One incident happened in a Jurong West flat. The feedback was received in October last year. The neighbour upstairs who was responsible for the leaking ceiling in the flat downstairs, refused to use the renovation contractor recommended by HDB and decided to engage his own contractor to do the repair. Unfortunately, the repair was not carried out properly and the problem was not resolved. The case dragged on until last month, taking a good six months before the problem was finally resolved.",1,134,012-002-093-018-030-134,470
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"I have another similar case of ceiling leakage in a Jurong East flat this time round, and it also took six months to resolve, from July to December 2014.",2,135,012-002-093-018-030-135,471
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"During the six-month period, you could imagine the agony of the residents who had to endure the ceiling leakage. This Amendment Bill is thus very helpful and timely to help mitigate the suffering of the residents who are victims of their inconsiderate neighbours. This is especially so when we have more than 80% of the resident population in Singapore staying in 940,000 HDB flats across the island and not all residents are cooperative.",3,136,012-002-093-018-030-136,472
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"However, critics may perceive such honourable intents as being draconian and autocratic. When we introduced the ban on the sale of chewing gum, we were the laughing stock of the western liberal societies who disregarded the rationale behind the policy. In fact, The Guardian, a London newspaper, devoted an entire article to the ban of chewing gum when Mr Lee Kuan Yew passed on, instead of acknowledging that the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew had transformed Singapore from a Third World country to First in less than a lifetime.",4,137,012-002-093-018-030-137,473
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"When we introduced caning against vandalism, we were called less than favourable terms, never mind the need to protect the property and public amenities. When we used hanging as a measure to control drug abuse and other very serious crimes, we were still very much condemned for being a cruel regime. Hence, the Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill that confers authorised HDB staff with the power to enter a flat with force and without prior notice to the occupier could go down as another example of Singapore's harsh autocratic laws. We must, however, decide what works for us.",5,138,012-002-093-018-030-138,474

In the worst circumstance, we do not want to see a situation whereby an elderly person living alone leaves his home and, two hours later, HDB officers paste the warrant on his door. When the elderly person comes back in the evening, because he is illiterate, he may take down the warrant and intend to find a friend to explain to him what the warrant is all about the next day. However, the following day, after he goes out at 7.00 am as usual, HDB officers make a forced entry. We also do not want to see the situation whereby families returning from a week-long holiday find their flat being forcibly entered by HDB officers under the power provided by section 26B when a forced entry is allowed without a warrant.",8,141,012-002-093-018-030-141,477
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"Hence, I hope HDB can put up some safeguard mechanism to prevent the power from being abused inadvertently. I would like to ask the Minister of State three questions.",9,142,012-002-093-018-030-142,478
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"First, Minister Khaw revealed last December that, every year, there were about 9,000 ceiling leak cases. Among them, 2,800 cases took more than three months to resolve. I would like to ask the Minister of State, suppose the Bill was passed a year ago, then how many such ceiling leak cases for which the power provided under section 26A or 26B would potentially have been applicable to deal with those uncooperative residents?",10,143,012-002-093-018-030-143,479
2015-04-13,Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-018-030,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"Second, the power provided under section 26A and 26B is very comprehensive. I would like to ask the Minister of State how HDB is going to train its officers to make sure that they use this power appropriately, and with a human touch? At the same time, will HDB set up a special committee to establish a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for forced entries?",11,144,012-002-093-018-030-144,480

Section 26A and B should only be used as a last resort.",12,145,012-002-093-018-030-145,481

In many instances, our grassroots leaders and community leaders could try to get involved and act as mediators.

The Hong Kong system, although meant for the public rental housing estate tenants, and similar to our traffic offence demerits system, could be a preferred softer approach in dealing with recalcitrant HDB flat owners before applying the harsher law of forced entry and financial penalty.",14,147,012-002-093-018-030-147,483

For example, denying a public servant to enter the flat for inspection would yield a penalty of seven points and refusal to repair a leaking pipe another seven points, rendering the tenant close to being dispelled from his flat. Similarly, HDB could consider a similar demerit system to soften the harsh law stipulated in the Amendment Bill. With that, I support the Bill.",15,148,012-002-093-018-030-148,484

Currently, HDB adopts a three-pronged approach. First, under current renovation guidelines, HDB flat owners are required to engage HDB-registered renovation contractors (RRCs) to do any renovation works. These RRCs are trained. They understand where the structural walls are, where the beams are, and they know better than to knock those down. They also have to obtain HDB's prior approval before starting any renovation work, especially those that involve demolition or hacking. This is to ensure that any demolition works proposed will not affect the structural integrity of the building and compromise public safety.",5,153,012-002-093-018-030-153,489

Sometimes, the contractors themselves are not aware that the instructions have gone directly from the home owner to the workers onsite.

I welcome such a practice. The residents living upstairs may be unwilling to repair the ceiling because they say ""I just paid for the repair a few months ago. You are asking me to spend money now on this again!"" So, they are rather reluctant. I would like to ask Minister of State whether there is a time limit for this. Is there a certain time period during which if the water leakage problem recurs, HDB will do the repair again for free? This is because water leakage problems may not appear immediately. Sometimes, they may take a few months, or even a year, to appear. That is why I want to ask whether there is a time limit for this.",2,194,012-002-093-018-030-194,530

When I first started serving in the capacity as a Member of Parliament in 2011, I, too, like many seniors before me in this Chamber, was faced with residents suffering spalling concrete and ceiling leak problems. I think this is a problem all of us encounter from time to time. I did ask engineers of HDB perhaps, ""Could you give me a briefing?"" And they did give me a briefing as to why these things happen.

So, it may take three to four days to identify the source of the spalling concrete and leak, and from the lower units' point of view, you need time to repair, treat the metal, replace the plaster, the concrete and so on. But if you compact that time and if things are done quickly because you do not want to spend the time or you think that is the recommendation of the contractor that you bring in, then invariably, very quickly, you will find that the problem recurs.",2,196,012-002-093-018-030-196,532

In the case of the withdrawal rules, we have allowed cohorts who turned 55 from 2013 to benefit because these cohorts were affected by the tightening of the withdrawal rules. For the cohort who turned 55 in 2012, or in other words, those aged 58 this year, we will allow a withdrawal of 10% of their Retirement Account savings at 65, since they were only allowed to withdraw 10% of their savings from 55.

IDA’s policy aims to encourage innovative services by ISPs, while protecting consumers’ interest in enjoying quality Internet access. For example, ISPs in Singapore can manage bandwidth usage during peak hours to ensure that user experiences are generally not affected.
