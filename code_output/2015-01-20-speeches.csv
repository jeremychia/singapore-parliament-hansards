2015-01-20,Administering Different Drugs and Treatment for Same Medical Conditions,012-002-093-002-001,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"Some of the drugs or treatments thus prescribed could be non-subsidised as there are more cost effective alternatives available. Nonetheless, where non-subsidised drugs or treatments are assessed to be clinically required and cannot be replaced by subsidised alternatives, patients from lower-income households are provided assistance to help them access these drugs or treatments.",3,4,012-002-093-002-001-004,4

2015-01-20,Administering Different Drugs and Treatment for Same Medical Conditions,012-002-093-002-001,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"Public hospitals have various governance frameworks in place to ensure that patients receive care appropriate to their clinical needs. This includes accreditation committees to ensure appropriate use of new technologies and procedures, and that procedures are performed by properly trained doctors. The Pharmacy and Therapeutic (P&T) and Medical Device (MDC) committees ensure clinically appropriate use of drugs and medical devices/ implants respectively. There are also pre-operations conferences for peer review of elective surgeries to ensure that they are appropriate, safe and not unnecessary.",5,6,012-002-093-002-001-006,6

2015-01-20,Administering Different Drugs and Treatment for Same Medical Conditions,012-002-093-002-001,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"  First, let me thank the Member for raising this Parliamentary Question (PQ), as well as for sharing this example. I think it is important for us to explain and clarify. Let me re-assure the Member that hospitals do not differentiate the treatment routes based on the subsidy status of the patients, as long as the treatment route is required and necessary.",1,8,012-002-093-002-001-008,8
2015-01-20,Administering Different Drugs and Treatment for Same Medical Conditions,012-002-093-002-001,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"For this instance, it is indeed unfortunate that there is this perception. We need to get more details to better understand the case. Let me briefly elaborate. There are clinical guidelines for pain management in different clinical conditions, which provide clinical guidance on the choice of pain relief drugs and these are in line with international practices.",2,9,012-002-093-002-001-009,9
2015-01-20,Administering Different Drugs and Treatment for Same Medical Conditions,012-002-093-002-001,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Typically, for pain management, as the Member has highlighted, clinical guidelines may give guidance to provide baseline pain management; further pain drugs may be added, if required; as well as to start with the least invasive drugs. This approach is quite typical across the different clinical conditions. The patient may first be prescribed oral Panadol. This could progress to stronger, more potent drugs, through injections, for instance. These are not without side effects.",3,10,012-002-093-002-001-010,10
2015-01-20,Administering Different Drugs and Treatment for Same Medical Conditions,012-002-093-002-001,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Basically, throughout the spectrum of drugs required for pain management, you can find subsidised drugs. So, the patient does not really have to pay more for these subsidised drugs. There is no Panadol injection, but as the Member has mentioned, there are more morphine, pethidine, nico injections which are in the Standard Drugs List. As I have said, they are stronger painkiller and they may not be without their side effects, so we need to ascertain if the patient's conditions will warrant these, and if these are suitable for the patient. We would need further details to better understand the case.",4,11,012-002-093-002-001-011,11
2015-01-20,Administering Different Drugs and Treatment for Same Medical Conditions,012-002-093-002-001,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"What I would like to reiterate is that the drug and treatment prescribed is what the doctor and the healthcare team deem as clinically appropriate, based on the patient's conditions and not based on the subsidy status of the patient.",5,12,012-002-093-002-001-012,12

Serving as a healthy living educational tool, the calendar incorporates healthy recipes, health tips and screening messages to help users make healthier choices for themselves and their families. The response was positive, and we have increased the distribution of the 2015 calendar tenfold, to 30,000 households. In fact, this initiative has proven so popular, we have just launched a Chinese version of this calendar for the Chinese community, too.",9,10,012-002-093-002-002-010,22

2015-01-20,Diseases Prevalent among Malay Community,012-002-093-002-002,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"  Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his reply. Two clarifications. First, in profiling the Malay community as being more prone to certain sorts of diseases, have these co-relations been identified through studies of profiles of the population or is it more genetics? I am just wondering if more in-depth research has been done.",1,15,012-002-093-002-002-015,27
2015-01-20,Diseases Prevalent among Malay Community,012-002-093-002-002,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Two, in terms of outreach, it is great to see outreach such as quit smoking campaigns being done in the mosques. The number of people been reached out to is about 5,000, and the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that one fifth had quit smoking, for example. This is good outreach but I think the numbers are still a bit small. There are also many other diseases that need to be managed as well. Is the Ministry considering more of such outreach or more of such collaborations in the community to address the other health issues?",2,16,012-002-093-002-002-016,28
2015-01-20,Diseases Prevalent among Malay Community,012-002-093-002-002,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"  I want to thank the Member for the supplementary questions. As I had mentioned earlier, all the non-communicable diseases have common lifestyle risk factors, which are linked very directly to obesity, the food that we eat, as well as the lack of sufficient physical activity. These affect diseases like high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Essentially, what we have been trying to do is encourage people to eat moderately, a balanced diet, to have physical activities and go for health screening.",1,17,012-002-093-002-002-017,29
2015-01-20,Diseases Prevalent among Malay Community,012-002-093-002-002,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"It is important that we embark on this. At the same time, we have noticed that different ethnic groups have different lifestyles. Even though all of us eat, Malays have their common way of eating and the dishes that they like. Similarly for the Chinese and the others.",2,18,012-002-093-002-002-018,30
2015-01-20,Diseases Prevalent among Malay Community,012-002-093-002-002,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"We have moved into a targeted approach, which I had shared earlier. The calendar is very popular this year. We not only give aspects of the calendar, but we also relate to their lifestyle, in terms of the food that they cook and their common habits, so that we can reach out to the different sectors of the community. We realised that over time they become excited about how to live healthily. With that aspect, we want to focus on these lifestyle factors.",3,19,012-002-093-002-002-019,31
2015-01-20,Diseases Prevalent among Malay Community,012-002-093-002-002,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Beyond that, in terms of genetics, we do not have significant evidence to show such a phenomenon. Based on what we have, and what research we have done locally, we realise that such lifestyle practices play an important role. And we can reduce the risk to such non-communicable diseases among the community if we focussed on the aspects of healthy eating, physical activity as well as go for proper and appropriate health screening.",4,20,012-002-093-002-002-020,32
2015-01-20,Diseases Prevalent among Malay Community,012-002-093-002-002,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"With regards to outreach, you will see that over time, we have been able to reach out to more and more Singaporeans in terms of the programmes that we have. For example, the calendar, we have increased it tremendously in terms of numbers. When we did it last year, we received many requests from the community, asking for more. I gave out more publicity materials than what I gave out last year. Demand has gone up so much, I had to ask for more materials.",5,21,012-002-093-002-002-021,33
2015-01-20,Diseases Prevalent among Malay Community,012-002-093-002-002,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Secondly, if you look at the anti-smoking campaign, ""I Quit"" programme, you would realise that the numbers not only have gone up, the number of families coming on-board to be part of this process of their family members has also gone up. I was there at last few years to share the load and to reach out to the community. I was so touched by the community support. Not only among the children and spouses, but also among grandparents coming to support to get their children to quit smoking.",6,22,012-002-093-002-002-022,34
2015-01-20,Diseases Prevalent among Malay Community,012-002-093-002-002,Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim,"Beyond these figures, anecdotally, I feel that there has also been an increase in terms of awareness about healthy living. For example, locally in my area, over two years, the number of Malays coming on board to be part of an exercise group which I join often, in fact, the numbers have gone up by three times. I just met them recently and I am so happy because I used to ask how many would need a calendar. In the past, it was about 10 to 15. This year, about close to 40 to 50 asked for it. When I went down, I met them. There was a sense of passion, commitment towards healthy living.",7,23,012-002-093-002-002-023,35

Some are short term, to deal with the short-term financial difficulties. Some are longer term for those facing prolonged difficulties. For instance, loan instalments are usually paid on the first of each month but HDB gives lessees up to the end of the month if they face temporary cash flow difficulties. But if they still face problems doing so, HDB will make a call, arrange a meet-up or even do a home visit, to better understand the situation and to offer help. The Member may note that every HDB branch has housing counsellors that offer financial counselling and explore sustainable housing options for homeowners in mortgage arrears.",2,7,012-002-093-002-003-007,45

Between the Notice of Intention and the actual acquisition, if HDB does need to resort to that, it can be many months, even up to a year or beyond.

I just want to move slightly onto a different note. I know most times we have been sympathetic and I credit HDB for being sympathetic for a lot of compassionate cases out there.

What is HDB's view on this because many a time, when they want to right size, you take into account all these cash surpluses that you get as part of the settlement. I think for many of them, they also get stuck in trying to get a new flat or to right size. So, what is HDB's view on credit card debts and other forms of debts?",2,23,012-002-093-002-003-023,61

Having said that, we recognise the realities and difficulties of life. Families may choose to settle all these debts to the detriment of their housing needs. It is, therefore, as I said in my answer earlier, that in the last resort HDB offers public rental housing or interim rental housing as these families take time to sort out the various issues.",1,24,012-002-093-002-003-024,62

Yes, it was expected because as we ramp up the numbers – 25,000 homes -- you should expect that the deficit will grow accordingly. But going forward I do not see us building 25,000 units per year for a long time. In fact, this is already Year Four, and we have started the process of tapering it down for the simple reason that the number of family formations is not of that order.

It does not matter whether there are, within that country, schemes like the CPF or even the fact that there are tax benefits for voluntary contributions to the CPF, for example, through the Minimum Sum Top-Up Scheme, none of those things matter.",2,14,012-002-093-002-007-014,118

That is our CPF contribution rate. And you compare that to Australia where the mandatory contribution is 9.5%, and Denmark which came up tops in this study, the mandatory contribution is between 6% and 11%. If you look narrowly at this score, then you could be led to draw a certain conclusion and forget the fact that even in the absence of large-scale retirement plans -- private plans, corporate retirement plans -- actually, employers in Singapore are already contributing quite a lot to employees' retirement savings through the CPF.",3,15,012-002-093-002-007-015,119

2015-01-20,COEs for Commercial Vehicles,012-002-093-002-012,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo),"Objectively speaking, the COE system has served us well in controlling the overall vehicle population. Road pricing, on the other hand, helps us manage regular road congestion by influencing road usage decisions. The two systems complement one another. A satellite-based Electronic Road Pricing system will certainly allow us to have more precise usage pricing, such as through distance-based charging on congested roads, and we will be reviewing in the next few years before ERP2 is implemented at the end of this decade, whether any of our policies could be improved. However, fundamentally, in land-scarce Singapore, controls on both vehicle ownership and usage will still be needed.",5,6,012-002-093-002-012-006,185

2015-01-20,COEs for Commercial Vehicles,012-002-093-002-012,Mrs Josephine Teo,"  Mdm Speaker, as Er Dr Lee was asking the question and expressing the concern that bigger companies were outbidding smaller companies who need smaller vehicles in Category C, it reminded me of an argument that was made very strongly just one or two years back that if we removed taxis from Category A, we would see a very different premium. In any case, we did remove taxi companies from bidding in Category A, but I think the results suggest that that argument was probably unfounded.",1,8,012-002-093-002-012-008,187

But I would say, the point that the Member raised that we want to attend to is that some smaller businesses do face pressures in terms of needing a vehicle for their business. Where we have put our efforts is in trying to be helpful to businesses in general, and small businesses in particular, where they need vehicles for the smooth operation of their businesses. There are several measures to help them manage the cost of vehicles.",2,9,012-002-093-002-012-009,188
2015-01-20,COEs for Commercial Vehicles,012-002-093-002-012,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Firstly, for example, commercial vehicles are subject to lower vehicle taxes. And when businesses purchase a vehicle, the Additional Registration Fee for commercial vehicles is set at 5% of the vehicle's Open Market Value (OMV), compared to an effective rate of between 100% and 180% of the OMV for cars. Commercial vehicles also enjoy lower effective road tax and are exempted from diesel fuel taxes.",3,10,012-002-093-002-012-010,189
2015-01-20,COEs for Commercial Vehicles,012-002-093-002-012,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Secondly, businesses are allowed repeated five-year renewals of their COE. Earlier on, I mentioned that 31,000 small delivery vans will have their COEs expiring between now and 2017. A large majority – more than 80% of them – has more than five years of statutory life remaining. They can thus choose to go for two consecutive five-year renewals, instead of renewing directly onto a 10-year COE. So, that facilitates their cashflow management.",4,11,012-002-093-002-012-011,190
2015-01-20,COEs for Commercial Vehicles,012-002-093-002-012,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Thirdly, we introduced the early turnover scheme where businesses can transfer any unused COE life to a new vehicle and enjoy discounts if they replace their more pollutive pre-Euro and Euro-1 diesel commercial vehicles. In addition, they do not need to bid for a new Category C COE. They only need to pay a discounted prevailing quota premium for such vehicles when they turn it over. And since the scheme was enhanced in March last year, in fact, the discount on the prevailing quota premium is, on average, $23,000, a very considerable amount. That is why we have seen a steady increase in the take-up on the early turn-over scheme.",5,12,012-002-093-002-012-012,191

2015-01-20,COEs for Commercial Vehicles,012-002-093-002-012,Mrs Josephine Teo,"As to the Member's second question on how many COEs will become available, your guess is as good as mine. It really depends on several factors. It depends on how many vehicles are deregistered and it also depends on what is the permitted vehicle growth rate, which we have already given indication of. But the de-registration really depends on the vehicle owners themselves. Analysts have given their own projections and forecasts. I think it is something that we will only really know when the de-registrations take place.",7,14,012-002-093-002-012-014,193

The more categories we split them into, it means that within each category the numbers that can be made available for bidding each cycle would likely be much more volatile, and we have to ask ourselves whether that is, in fact, helpful to small businesses.",1,16,012-002-093-002-012-016,195

Now, there are some statistics we can gather from this Gravitrap programme. But let me explain that this is by no means a comprehensive surveillance of the entire country. But where we have placed Gravitraps, we estimated from the start of the programme that some 32,000 mosquitoes have been caught in these Gravitraps. So I am not sure what to make of it, but this is the first year when we have such a statistic, so we will probably use this as a basis for study going forward.

Indeed, there is a comprehensive set of existing rules which regulate the living conditions of foreign employees, safeguard their safety and well-being, and reduce disamenities on the neighbours. These apply to all forms of foreign worker accommodation, and cover areas such as building and fire safety, minimum living space, and hygiene standards. These standards are in place and will be enforced and will continue to be so. Many of the unsafe or unsanitary conditions that some Members have referred to are conditions that already contravene these existing rules; and we have taken and will continue to take firm action against errant parties.

2015-01-20,Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill,012-002-093-002-016,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"So, why is this Bill needed? First, Government's longer-term view is that the accommodation needs of Work Permit Holders are best met in such dormitories, where there are self-contained living, social and recreational facilities. We have been launching new and larger Purpose Built Dormitory (PBD) sites over the past few years, and will continue doing so to meet housing demand for a foreign workforce, especially for the Construction, Marine and Process sectors. Such larger PBDs will form an increasingly prominent part of the foreign worker housing landscape.",4,5,012-002-093-002-016-005,242

This Bill is therefore a progressive measure aimed at ensuring better design parameters and requirements that would be woven into the development of these new PBDs as they are being built. I would like to emphasise again that the existing regulations will continue to apply to both larger and smaller dormitories. The new regulations complement rather than replace existing ones.",5,6,012-002-093-002-016-006,243

We propose to impose additional requirements on larger dormitories with 1,000 beds or more through a licensing regime. Dormitories which meet the threshold will be required to obtain a licence, in addition to complying with all existing regulatory standards. It includes existing dormitories which already house 1,000 foreign workers; or are approved to house this number of workers, even if they currently do not.",6,7,012-002-093-002-016-007,244

What then? As I have mentioned earlier, it is important to remember that these ""smaller"" dormitories will continue to be subject to our existing comprehensive regulations to protect the safety and well-being of residents.

I will repeat, there are existing regulations that continue to be enforced, and we continue to monitor them and to improve on them, to strengthen them as it goes on. Going forward, we will be seeing many more PBDs built of this scale, which is why it is important to add on some of these additional requirements, because the nature and dynamics of the far larger dorms are quite different from some of the smaller ones.

Thus, in the last two years, Madam, calls from the migrant workers advocacy groups, including the Migrant Workers' Centre, has led to the Government concerted efforts moving forwards to opening up more new supplies of purpose-built housing.

Our case data shows that the complaints from migrant workers almost all concerns are about smaller factory-converted, temporary or even makeshift accommodation arrangements accommodating less than 1,000 workers. Just a few months ago, in November 2014, the MWC itself responded quite aggressively to one such case in Selegie, where information uncovered by my team suggested that more than 100 migrant workers were being housed in just two small residential condominium units.",4,54,012-002-093-002-016-054,291

2015-01-20,Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill,012-002-093-002-016,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"The MWC has long advocated for on-site social and commercial amenities to be included in the planning of new dormitories. Together with health and safety considerations as well as security concerns, whether within individual dormitories or in clusters, had resulted in the MWC being the first to moot the idea of forming an industry association, which could, aside from their other responsibilities, present an industry representative to work with our authorities in developing and implementing the industry-wide standards. Having advised on the formation of the Dormitory Association of Singapore Limited (DASL) in January 2013, and we have been working very closely with them, I was quite glad to know that actually they are in support of the FEDB. I must also thank the Government agencies for helping the members of DASL to be able to be engaged and consulted to give such an outcome.",12,62,012-002-093-002-016-062,299

2015-01-20,Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill,012-002-093-002-016,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"However, during our discussion, there is one worry that has kept coming up – the inadvertent creation and, much worse, perpetuation of a double standard by the FEDB's segregation between the smaller and larger dormitories. Even more worrying are the negative externalities that might arise if this ""double standard"" is allowed to become structured.",14,64,012-002-093-002-016-064,301
2015-01-20,Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill,012-002-093-002-016,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"Madam, let me elaborate. Today, employers constantly grapple with their business costs and depending on the considerations that drive them, and the degree of importance they place on keeping costs as low as possible, many of the more errant bosses prefer to house their workers in a cheaper, less favourable, and often smaller accommodation. The cases are well publicised and we know that the phenomenon is common. What is worrying for the operators of properly licensed dormitories is how the requirements and conditions in the FEDB will inevitably lead to further increases in their own running costs that will be passed on to the consumers.",15,65,012-002-093-002-016-065,302
2015-01-20,Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill,012-002-093-002-016,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"The fear of this happening is that while the increase in cost of compliance applies to the larger dormitories that already practise higher standards today, the FEDB seems to leave the smaller operations to their own devices. The latter group will continue to serve a relevant purpose as I have mentioned earlier, and it is difficult to argue with a simple economic proposition that higher costs for larger, purpose-built dormitories will make smaller, cheaper dormitories held to a lesser standard even more attractive to the employers. In the long term, if this preference begins to take root and the concern is not addressed, the large operators are concerned that the uneven treatment towards these two groups might pull down overall migrant housing standards in general.",16,66,012-002-093-002-016-066,303
2015-01-20,Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill,012-002-093-002-016,Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio),"I would therefore suggest that our authorities guard against over-regulation of one segment of the industry and, as far as possible or appropriate, apply the standards and conditions as general as possible to all.

Two firemen and eight other individuals suffered injuries from this blaze. The unit in question – reported to be an area only slightly bigger than 1,300 sq feet – had nine rooms, each equipped with bunk beds, a tiny kitchen and a toilet. The Malaysian Star newspaper, Stomp and a TODAY article reported that the premises was occupied by some 100 foreigners from China, India, Bangladesh and Malaysia, partitioned into 11 units of rooms, each occupied by about 10 people. The local Chinese paper Shin Min Daily News, on the other hand, reported that the affected unit of the three-storey walk-up apartment had 11 rooms, each occupied by up to eight workers, which makes for a total of about 88 people in a single apartment.",2,70,012-002-093-002-016-070,307

The same article reminded readers that the paper had raised several reports earlier on unhygienic and overcrowded foreign worker housing, recounting of an incident at a Punggol HDB construction site where hundreds of workers had to use choked and broken urinals, and another story covering the plight of about 5,000 workers living at Tuas View Square in factory-converted dormitories infested with rats and mosquitoes.",4,72,012-002-093-002-016-072,309

A recent Business Times' article reported that the first half of 2014 saw 360 inspections.

I would like to ask the Minister what plans are envisaged to reduce this threshold number within the context of the Bill since it is explicitly suggested in the Explanatory Note and, separately, how this figure of 1,000 was arrived at, in the first instance, in view of the need for greater oversight, regulation and enforcement across this industry, than is currently the case.",7,75,012-002-093-002-016-075,312

The reason for this sudden turn of events was put down to more construction firms being permitted by the authorities to set up foreign worker quarters on the sites of major building projects, such as LTA and HDB sites. I recognise that manpower proximity to the workplace helps reduce costs for businesses, particularly construction contractors. To this extent, Government policies should support such considerations wherever possible. However, rendering such operational flexibility for businesses would have been an opportune time to introduce clear licensing requirements, regulatory standards and a penalty framework for such temporary foreign worker quarters. This would have greatly supported the contractors on the one hand, and improved the living conditions of foreign workers on the other.",8,76,012-002-093-002-016-076,313

Such a broad strategy would have been aligned with the purpose of this Bill, as spelt out in clause 4, which seeks to establish certain accommodation standards for foreign employee dormitories; for the appropriate mechanisms to ensure adherence to those very standards, and to promote the sustainability of, and continuous improvements in, the provision of services at foreign employee dormitories.",9,77,012-002-093-002-016-077,314

For example, employers that employ 100 or less foreign workers, being more sensitive to cost pressures, can be eligible to house their workers in Government-built and operated dormitories which set the standard for the entire industry. The entry of the Government into the sector can be modelled along the entry of the Ministry of Education into the kindergarten business, which is to provide good pre-school education and, more importantly, to catalyse improvements in this sector. If deemed appropriate, a fraction of the foreign worker levy can be used to establish such dormitories with the subsidy for small companies that show real and sustained productivity improvements in their operations.",10,78,012-002-093-002-016-078,315

This is a positive move as it would prevent savvy operators who would nonetheless operate assiduously to work around the 1,000-bed threshold by all means, effectively negating Parliament's intent, for example, by creating sister companies through friends and families. I would like to ask the Minister whether the Ministry has determined how many additional dormitory operators are likely to come under this scenario, as spelt out in the Explanatory Note, and how many beds, so to speak, would come under the licensing framework as a result of this envisaged subsidiary legislation.",11,79,012-002-093-002-016-079,316

An officer of the minority shareholder, Averic Capital Management, was then quoted as saying, ""As the Singapore economy grows, likely so will the dormitory business. We're hopeful the economy remains robust; then there will be more opportunities to invest in this asset class."" About two-and-a-half years later, Morgan Stanley sought to exit the dormitory business, citing a dearth of sites made available for dormitory development by the Government, preventing them from enlarging their portfolio to spin off the business into a dormitory real estate investment trust.

Would it cover financial institutions and funds that are the ultimate owners and who seek to unlock value in such investments? In keeping with the purpose of the Bill as made out in clause 4, would it not be less ambiguous and in keeping with the parliamentary intention of the Bill to make the licence holder and the owner or owners, regardless of their shareholding, jointly and severally liable for any infractions committed by the licence holder?

This is especially so since big corporates can potentially come on board and purchase strategic stakes in foreign employee dormitories as investors. The benefits of such a prospect should not be only to unlock shareholder value. I would argue that the benefits should flow back to industry and to society, and align itself to the purpose of this Bill. In some cases, the financial heft of big corporates and holding companies and their ability to undertake independent risk assessments put them in a good position to be the quasi-regulators of this industry, by virtue of ownership, alongside the Dormitory Association of Singapore.",18,86,012-002-093-002-016-086,323

Such an approach would be fairer and serve regulators and businesses better too, as it would not unwittingly penalise honest businesses which operate large dormitories that this Bill will regulate who play the game by the rules, and will do many Singaporeans a great service by improving the lot of our foreign workers. If Singapore manages to scale up its standards of foreign employee accommodation, our businesses are likely to attract higher quality workers and significantly lower the risk of another tragic and senseless fire in Geylang or potentially wanton violations of statutory regulations, as evidenced by the secret dormitories in Tampines.",19,87,012-002-093-002-016-087,324

About half of them are Malaysians, who commute to work daily across the Causeway.

Is it the intention to impose a heavier regulatory burden on operators of larger dormitories?",8,151,012-002-093-002-016-151,388

Accommodating large numbers of foreign workers carries a cost to society as a whole. It is the responsibility of employers to fully price such costs into their operations. Workers need to be taken care of according to standards that the social conscience of Singapore today requires. Very often, the social cost of accommodating low-wage workers are hidden from view and not properly accounted for. In that sense, poor quality conditions in accommodating foreign workers often push the cost to society. Thank you, Madam.",12,155,012-002-093-002-016-155,392

During my weekly house visits and grassroots events, I have gathered feedback from residents as well as grassroots leaders living within a stone's throw from the lodges on some of the social dis-amenities which they had to contend with. I will attempt to share some of the challenges faced, what are the actions taken by us thus far and suggestions moving forward in light of this new piece of legislation. I would classify them into three broad categories, namely (1) Safety and Security, (2) Environment and (3) Transport.",4,203,012-002-093-002-016-203,440

These include congregation at void decks and open grass patches, public consumption of liquor, illegal tapping of Wifi, and cycling on pedestrian footpaths.

2015-01-20,Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill,012-002-093-002-016,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon) :,"The third challenge involves transport in that they fuel the overcrowding of feeder service 811 during peak hours. Although the majority of foreign workers living at Simpang Lodge 1 and 2 have company-provided transport, the remainder do not have company- provided transport. As such, they utilise the feeder service number 811 located nearest their dormitories daily to get to Yishun bus interchange and Yishun MRT station. This further exacerbates the already well-utilised service 811 as many of our Yishun residents, including students, use that feeder service each morning to get to school or go to work. The overcrowding occurs during peak hours in the morning and crowding at the bus interchange in the evening for the return trip.",7,206,012-002-093-002-016-206,443

Auxiliary police officers have also been deployed at the areas of possible congregation to carry out foot patrols. Targeted enforcement against errant cyclists who ride on pedestrian footpaths has also been taken. Our grassroots volunteers also perform Citizens on Patrol to augment the forces. Police CCTVs have also been installed at the lift and staircase access points of the HDB blocks in proximity and CCTVs deployed at alcohol sales locations.

In fact, I just did house visits to the three affected blocks two days ago and the residents there shared that the safety and security and environment issues have improved but quite a number still encounter long waits and overcrowding of bus service 811 during peak hours as well as on weekends. This is further exacerbated by the fact that there is bunching of buses as well as commuters not moving to the rear. I submit and recommend that a 811 peak period service dedicated solely to those two bus stops within proximity to the Simpang Lodges, or a new bus service be catered to alleviate the load.",13,212,012-002-093-002-016-212,449

We want to help them become socially integrated and adapted to our society through understanding our cultures, behaviours, customs, attitudes and laws.

The business of operating dormitories will need to achieve a certain scale to justify the building of these facilities expected of the operator.

Perhaps the Government should consider taking on the role of developer or proprietor of foreign workers' dormitories, so as to disintermediate, or remove one layer of commercial profit-making. Some commercial entities may be allowed to own and develop dormitories if they intend to operate the dormitories or are meant to house their own staff, as in the case of Keppel Corp and SembCorp. This approach offers the Government more control over the dormitories' ""hardware"", and the flexibility to choose qualified dormitory operators whose key focus will just be to run the day-to-day dormitory operations effectively and efficiently.",13,229,012-002-093-002-016-229,466

Whilst many Singaporeans will welcome this, it is important that we do not inadvertently encourage discrimination and prejudice against foreign workers, or confine them to a ghetto, and restrict their opportunity to assimilate and appreciate Singapore's culture and way of living. We must continue to foster a sense of mutual respect between Singaporeans and these workers, who are here to do jobs we would rather not do, and to help build our economy. For example, in my ward, I have found it useful to involve workers from nearby dormitories in community events and projects, as well as join our Citizens-on-Patrol, as a means to understand each other better.",14,230,012-002-093-002-016-230,467

In particular, the explanatory notes state that compliance directives may be issued to a licensed operator without the need for the licensed operator to be heard, and that non-compliance is an arrestable offence.

In particular, housing types raised by Members, for example, on-site workers' quarters – that is one area that we are looking at as well. I would also add that the authorities are also watching the density and the use of these sites. Apart from managing the standards that are expected and required, we are also looking at what sites ought to be approved, where are the areas that ought to be approved, and as we build up more purpose-built dormitories (PBDs), we are also looking at being a lot stricter in giving approvals for the use of the use of various premises for housing foreign workers.",10,245,012-002-093-002-016-245,482

2015-01-20,Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill,012-002-093-002-016,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,This level of coordination is going on across Government agencies and we do continue to want to strengthen that. This may not always be apparent because this often takes place in the background. But this work will continue and we will continue to emphasise and strengthen the collaboration and co-operation across various stakeholders.,13,248,012-002-093-002-016-248,485
2015-01-20,Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill,012-002-093-002-016,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mr Gan Thiam Poh also raised the issue of whether employers from specific sectors should be allowed to house their workers in better equipped purpose-built dormitories. While the Government's view is that the PBDs can better cater to Work Permit holders' housing needs, there are also merits to housing workers on or near to their work sites. For example, this would alleviate the need to transport them back and forth. There will be an impact on productivity. There will also be less loading on the public transport system during peak hours. Therefore, such non PBDs still remain a space in which we need to look at in terms of providing housing options provided they continue to meet the existing regulatory requirements on appropriate housing standards. Where these requirements are not met, where these standards are not met, we do urge the public, we do urge those who are aware of such violations to raise it. Our authorities will inspect and our authorities will inspect and take action. That is what a lot of officers do on a week-to-week basis.",14,249,012-002-093-002-016-249,486

This is one of the common concerns that have been raised by many about why only those dormitories above 1,000 beds; how about those that are less? They suggested lowering the 1,000-bed threshold to cover dormitories housing fewer workers. Assoc Prof Randolph Tan have also asked if concerns about unintended outcomes arising from the threshold had been considered.",15,250,012-002-093-002-016-250,487
2015-01-20,Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill,012-002-093-002-016,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"To put things in perspective, the threshold of 1,000 beds will cover all existing purpose-built dormitories, and all the new purpose-built dormitories coming on-stream will offer 1,000 beds and above. That is where we are going with the purpose-built dorms. It is important for us to factor these requirements in upstream, so they be designed and to be worked in to the building of the purpose-built dorms; not just the physical infrastructure, but the way in which it has to be run. It does not mean that the rest of the space is not being regulated – they are. It also does not mean that we will not also look at whether to strengthen and how to strengthen the regulations for the smaller dorms or smaller accommodations which house fewer than 1,000 beds.",16,251,012-002-093-002-016-251,488
2015-01-20,Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill,012-002-093-002-016,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"It is a considered decision. We had also debated why a 1,000 beds, should it less, should it be more. We looked at the spread of the different housing types and numbers that they house. We felt that, going forward, that is what we are going to do with PBDs – we are going to have a lot more of these and that why it is important for this Bill to move now rather than wait for a complete solution. The rest of the other measures will unfold with time as we look into it and to see how best to strengthen them.",17,252,012-002-093-002-016-252,489
2015-01-20,Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill,012-002-093-002-016,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Over time, as more PBD sites are launched, we will expect the proportion of foreign workers staying in larger dormitories within the threshold to increase. As I have mentioned earlier, we will also manage in terms of the permission given for contractors, for developers, in terms of requesting various sites to house their workers. As more of these PBDs come on- site, and we will also begin to take a stricter view about how workers are housed elsewhere. Therefore, you will begin to see a lot more of them shifting towards the PBDs.",18,253,012-002-093-002-016-253,490
2015-01-20,Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill,012-002-093-002-016,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"There is, therefore, this need to manage upstream the different dynamics that come with a larger site. As I have highlighted earlier, the 1,000-bed threshold was selected because of the different challenges posed by such larger dormitories, as well as the fact that the requirements that we will impose such as outdoor recreation spaces and minimarts, for example, are only possible actually in larger dormitories.",19,254,012-002-093-002-016-254,491

There are other solutions, for example, we also encourage the building of recreational centres which cater to clusters. For example, there are areas where they, perhaps, may not be so many of such PBDs but there are housing facilities housing smaller numbers of workers, but there is a whole cluster of them who have needs to be met, and that is where recreational centres are being built to address those.",20,255,012-002-093-002-016-255,492
2015-01-20,Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill,012-002-093-002-016,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"There are practical reasons why this is so. For example, we are aware of security concerns. We are also aware of healthcare concerns. For smaller dorms or smaller accommodation spaces, when outbreaks happen, you can manage it, you have quarantine. But when you have a much larger dorm, the requirements are quite different, the scale is very different. We need to weave this into the design of the dormitories themselves.",21,256,012-002-093-002-016-256,493
2015-01-20,Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill,012-002-093-002-016,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Instead of just lowering the threshold, the more practical approach we believe is to add on additional requirements for dormitories above 1,000 beds. I emphasise again  existing regulations continue to be there. They continue to be important. They continue to cover a wide range of the concerns that we have today, and they will be looked at and will continue to be strengthened over time. But for the many PBDs that are going to come on line – the existing ones and the new ones – we do need these additional requirements because the scale of those dormitories is quite different. These requirements will be on top of the existing levers which will continue to apply.",22,257,012-002-093-002-016-257,494
2015-01-20,Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill,012-002-093-002-016,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Having said this, we will also bear in mind the suggestion, the possibility of having different classes of licences in the future, should experience show that this is needed. Which is why the way the Bill is structured allows us to have the space to have different classes of licences and to be able to adjust the numbers accordingly, should the need arises.",23,258,012-002-093-002-016-258,495
2015-01-20,Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill,012-002-093-002-016,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Pritam Singh were also concerned that whether operators can potentially escape licensing by sub-dividing their premises to fall slightly below the threshold of 1,000 beds; or as Er Dr Lee Bee Wah mentioned, ""What about the 999-bed dorms"". We have recognised this and we know that people are very creative. Whatever laws that we come up with, they will find creative ways to circumvent them.",24,259,012-002-093-002-016-259,496
2015-01-20,Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill,012-002-093-002-016,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"For the vast majority of dormitories which will be government-tendered, the proprietors are obliged to provide enough bed spaces for a pre-determined number of workers. Any request for subdivision will be evaluated and will be subjected to approval by the relevant authorities. Moreover, we have made provisions in the Bill precisely to prevent this kind of gaming by empowering the Commissioner to deem a group of buildings, structures or facilities as one dormitory for the purpose of dorm licensing. We are fully aware that there is a likelihood, in fact, in our discussions with the various stakeholders with the dorm operators themselves, they themselves have also raised various questions, ""What happens if we have this, that and the other?"" This is where we share the same concern as you do, and we have worked it into the Bill so that we make sure we are able to prevent such gaming of the system.",25,260,012-002-093-002-016-260,497
2015-01-20,Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill,012-002-093-002-016,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Members such as Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef and Ms Irene Ng have commented on the affordability of PBD beds, in particular, dormitories may raise bed prices in response to the cost of meeting higher regulatory standards. The Government has also been injecting more land for development of PBDs over the last few years. As PBDs are completed over the coming years, more bed spaces are coming online in the next few years, we have reasons to believe that the dormitory operators will need to keep prices competitive to attract tenants. At the same time, as I had mentioned earlier, we are also watching the space in terms of permission granted for other types of dormitories being set up, housing of smaller numbers of workers in other types of accommodations.",26,261,012-002-093-002-016-261,498
2015-01-20,Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill,012-002-093-002-016,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Let me point out that the additional requirements to be imposed through this regime have been included in the tender conditions for new dormitories since last year. What it means is that the bidders of these sites must calculate the necessary compliance costs including the additional regulatory requirements of larger dorms as part of their overall business plans, and therefore, adjust the costs in their bids accordingly. This mechanism will also allow them to ensure that they do not just pass on the cost. Often times, if you overbid for a particular project, you will have to find ways to recover that. But when all these requirements are upfront, they will have to factor that in so that they bid accordingly. This will to help manage the cost and to ensure that they do not transfer it on to others, especially to the workers.",27,262,012-002-093-002-016-262,499
2015-01-20,Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill,012-002-093-002-016,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"For existing dormitories which were not built to the new standards, as many of Members have acknowledged, it is important for us to allow some flexibility on a case-by-case basis when it is extremely difficult for the dormitory to comply. We will give time and we support their effort. For instance, there may be space constraints and it might just not be possible to provide sufficient outdoor recreation space. We will provide some form of financial assistance to retrofit existing dormitories to ease operators into the new framework and reduce the need to pass on the cost through higher bed prices. More details will be provided to the industries when these are finalised.",28,263,012-002-093-002-016-263,500

We kept such contingencies in view and consulted quite extensively with the relevant agencies, including SPF, MOH and NEA when formulating the licensing conditions. Many of the requirements imposed on the dormitory operators are devised precisely to facilitate the intervention of the relevant agencies in an emergency. We would also like to assure Ms Irene Ng that it is not the intention of the government to make dormitories restrictive places to live in. There are also extensive requirements pertaining to areas such as social and recreational amenities which ensure that dorms better meet the needs of the residents.",30,265,012-002-093-002-016-265,502

We worked closely with the Members on the licensing conditions and have incorporated their inputs where possible. The licensing conditions set the minimum standards that the licensed dormitories have to comply with, and are intended to complement the broader suite of foreign workers management initiatives that I had earlier mentioned. Nonetheless, we will encourage operators to provide additional services or amenities that best serve the specific needs of their residents.",31,266,012-002-093-002-016-266,503

I fully agree with that. Assoc Prof Tan can be assured that sufficient resources have been allocated to the task. On the other hand, I would also like to ensure Ms Foo Mee Har and Mrs Lina Chiam that we will not go overboard either, and that the powers of the Commissioner and inspectors will be exercised judiciously. They will have a wide range of tools and levers that can be calibrated according to the situation. For example, the offense of running a large dormitory without a licence is a particularly egregious one. We have, therefore, made this an arrestable offence.",33,268,012-002-093-002-016-268,505
2015-01-20,Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill,012-002-093-002-016,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"It is also imperative that the Commissioner has powers to use compliance directives to respond effectively to disorder and risks to the dormitory residents' health and safety. In such exceptional circumstances, when time is of the essence, the Commissioner needs to have the power to direct dormitories to comply immediately with the necessary requirements, even if these have not been communicated beforehand. As many Members have shared, for instances of violations, we do take these quite seriously. The changes we have made in the EFMA in the preceding years, and some of these measures we are putting in place are to give the authorities more clout to be able to step in, in a much more decisive fashion. We are going to do the same for dormitories and housing arrangements for fewer than 1,000 workers.",34,269,012-002-093-002-016-269,506

For instance, for the modification of licensing conditions, the Commissioner must give a notice period of at least 14 days, during which the operator may make written representations. Clause 13(2) also states clearly the circumstances under which the Commissioner may issue a compliance directive, for instance, when the dormitory has contravened a licensing condition.",35,270,012-002-093-002-016-270,507

Agencies have, therefore, been working with Members and grassroots leaders to tackle the challenges on the ground, and we will continue with these efforts.

My officers see violations every week. Are we able to eradicate them? It is probably difficult and probably not possible to say we can eradicate them completely. But we must endeavour to eradicate as much of them as possible. This is where we do need the strength of the regulations and the laws for us to be able to take action.

So, we also need to evaluate that. But information is important, whether through industry insiders, through members of the public, through the media, through the NGOs.

The Minister mentioned that the Bill targets those dormitories that are housing 1,000 workers and above. But this Bill's name is ""Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill"". Why do we not call the Bill the ""Purpose-Built Dormitory Bill""? That is, we call a spade, a spade. It is still important for us to ensure that all the other dormitories are properly regulated.

It does not mean there are no regulations in place; it does not mean that the present regulations governing the welfare of the foreign workforce are inadequate.

2015-01-20,Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill,012-002-093-002-016,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"  Mdm Speaker, I am not sure ""herding"" will be the appropriate term to use in this context. But the idea is that, going forward, we will be building more purpose-built dormitories of that size. We would like to shift more of the housing accommodation needs for our foreign workforce into that sector. It does not mean that the need for some of these factory-converted dormitories (FCDs) does not exist. We do know there are also many FCDs, for example, that do need regulations and which are of a suitable standard to provide housing and accommodation for the foreign workforce. There is a reason for that, because housing them, for example, on-site, would actually be a lot more productive, would save a lot of time, I think for the foreign workers themselves as well. But the standards must be met.",1,290,012-002-093-002-016-290,527
2015-01-20,Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill,012-002-093-002-016,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"As we go forward, as we build and provide more of this bed space elsewhere, we would also look at the approval process for the different accommodation for workers. For example, URA has also issued some guidelines on some of the areas. If we have a number of FCDs and we feel that the density has exceeded what we feel is comfortable, we will place a cap and basically not allowing further FCDs to be allowed on those premises.",2,291,012-002-093-002-016-291,528

So, maybe a little bit like going back to the old days of JTC building workers' dormitories so that this does not have to be – because I think the risk of the very comprehensive set of regulations and the hefty penalties may preclude some of the smaller players from coming into the space.

2015-01-20,Measures to Help SMEs Pursuing Greater Productivity to Cope with Rising Costs,012-002-093-002-018,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"  As part of economic restructuring, the Government has provided continued support to SMEs to upgrade their capabilities and improve productivity through schemes such as the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC), Innovation and Capability Voucher (ICV) and Capability Development Grant (CDG). We are seeing some encouraging developments and positive results from these initiatives. In a recent survey conducted by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI), 90.3% of surveyed companies have adopted productivity measures in 2014, compared to 83.9% in the previous year. Another survey conducted by DP Information Group in 2014 showed that a growing number of SMEs are pursuing productivity improvements and investing in new technologies.",1,2,012-002-093-002-018-002,551

We have collaborated with Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) to set up a network of 12 SME Centres, to assist SMEs from different parts of Singapore. The SME Workgroup, comprising representatives from the government and private sector, has also been reaching out to SMEs to gather feedback and explain how the companies can benefit from different government schemes. Some initiatives which we will be implementing based on industry feedback is to facilitate the participation of SMEs in government procurement tenders by publicising more information on how SMEs have successfully bid for such tenders, and to work with Singapore Business Federation (SBF) on a fair to increase awareness of the available opportunities.",2,3,012-002-093-002-018-003,552

Export-oriented sectors registered healthy productivity growth of 2.1% per annum from 2010 to 2013, which is significantly higher than the 0.2% per annum growth for the overall economy. These sectors accounted for 56% of value-added in Singapore’s economy. For other sectors, including retail, food services and construction, the Government will continue to work with companies and industry associations to raise productivity and improve efficiency. We have to persevere with these efforts as sustained productivity improvements are essential for Singapore’s economy to remain competitive, and to provide good jobs for Singaporeans.",3,4,012-002-093-002-018-004,553

For example, rentals for industrial space have been moderating, following our release of more land and space over the past few years. In 3Q 2014, the rental indices for overall industrial space and multiple-user factory space fell by 1.3% and 2.3% respectively, on a year-on-year basis. This is the first year-on-year decline since 2010. There will also be a steady supply of industrial and retail space in 2015 and 2016, which will help to exert downward pressure on industrial rents and land prices. In addition, we are improving the transparency of rental data for industrial, retail, and office space, which will provide more information for SMEs to make their leasing decisions.",4,5,012-002-093-002-018-005,554

We continue to be affected by transboundary haze from the region. The number of hotspots detected in Sumatra and Kalimantan in 2014 was in fact higher this year, – 28,580 hot spots compared to 18,129 in 2013.

2015-01-20,Manpower-intensive Industries in Productive Economy,012-002-093-002-022,Mr Christopher de Souza,asked the Minister for Manpower how will the drive towards a more productive economy be made sufficiently flexible to accommodate manpower-intensive industries such as the construction industry and those industries that are heavily dependent on foreign workers.,1,1,012-002-093-002-022-001,568
2015-01-20,Manpower-intensive Industries in Productive Economy,012-002-093-002-022,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"  MOM understands that foreign manpower needs differ across sectors. We have catered for sector-specific needs by applying different Dependency Ratio Ceilings to the five broad sectors – Construction, Manufacturing, Services, Marine and Process. In general, higher Dependency Ratio Ceilings are granted to industries where the nature of work tends to be relatively unattractive, as locals are less inclined to perform these jobs. For instance, both the Construction and Process sectors enjoy a very high Dependency Ratio Ceiling of seven foreign workers for every local worker hired. We have also provided flexibility in industries where there is an essential economic or social need on an exceptional basis. This explains why we have specific provisions for industries like conservancy and healthcare.",1,2,012-002-093-002-022-002,569
2015-01-20,Manpower-intensive Industries in Productive Economy,012-002-093-002-022,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"While some flexibility is accorded, we cannot afford to entrench our dependence unsustainably on large numbers of low-skilled foreign workers. For the industries that many of us perceive to be ""manpower-intensive"" and ""heavily dependent on foreign workers"", we should ask ourselves whether such industries are similarly labour-intensive in other developed countries. Often, they are not, with reliance on technology or self-service instead. The higher productivity level of such industries then allows higher wages to be paid.",2,3,012-002-093-002-022-003,570
2015-01-20,Manpower-intensive Industries in Productive Economy,012-002-093-002-022,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"So we must change the nature of work of many labour-intensive industries to be manpower-lean. Even if it is difficult to attract locals to do such roles, it should still be done with fewer foreign workers, who have good skill levels. Manpower-intensive industries such as Construction can rely on less manpower once a better quality workforce is built up. Our recent announcements, such as mandating a minimum R1 proportion in the Construction sector from 2017 onwards, support this shift.",3,4,012-002-093-002-022-004,571

Among these seven agencies, there were 45 cases of harassment or abuse reported to the Police in 20141. This was an increase from the 25 cases reported in 2013.

The Act extended protection from harassment for public officers to include public service workers who deliver public services that are essential to Singaporeans’ daily lives, such as nurses working in our restructured hospitals.

Last year, MOM investigated and took action against 150 firms for having discriminatory employment practices. Some were given stern warnings while others had their work pass privileges curtailed for up to two years. We might also name and shame these employers. One example is Prime Gold International Ltd after investigations revealed that the firm discriminated against Singaporean employees by unfairly replacing them with foreigners.

The current focus is on expanding Changi Airbase East and building a new runway at Changi, a complex undertaking that requires highly skilled engineering as well as close coordination with the ongoing runway and terminal expansion works at Singapore Changi Airport. Construction of facilities at Changi will commence after detailed site surveys and land preparation works are completed. For Tengah Airbase, the current effort is on the detailed airbase facility design.",2,3,012-002-093-002-035-003,630

2015-01-20,Indonesia's Relations with Singapore and ASEAN,012-002-093-002-037,Mr K Shanmugam,"  Singapore’s relations with Indonesia have always been broad-based and multi-faceted. This is underpinned by mutual respect and ""win-win"" cooperation in various fields, such as the economy, education, environment, health and defence. Our ties at the leadership level are excellent and are buttressed by strong people-to-people links. We have also stood together in solidarity during times of crises. For instance, we just commemorated the tenth anniversary of the tsunami that devastated Aceh on 26 December 2004. The Singapore Armed Forces worked closely with the Indonesian military to help the victims and their families in the aftermath of the disaster. During the recent crash of AirAsia flight QZ 8501, Singapore supported the search and locate and subsequent recovery efforts led by Indonesia. Our agencies operated closely with their Indonesian counterparts, leveraging on the close ties forged over many years. Similarly, we have cooperated closely in international and regional forums. Singapore and Indonesia share similar views on the need for a stable region with an open and inclusive regional architecture. We have worked well together to promote ASEAN centrality, stability and prosperity. When there are outstanding or difficult issues, we have been able to discuss them in a frank and constructive manner in order to find a way forward. Ultimately, we understand that as neighbours and regional partners, there is much to be gained in strengthening the relationship between our two countries. I am confident that this will continue to be the case going forward.",1,2,012-002-093-002-037-002,636

In their discussions, PM Lee and President Joko committed to maintain the strong cooperation between our countries. PM Lee expressed Singapore’s willingness to work closely with President Joko’s Administration in areas where there are complementarities. I also met my foreign affairs counterpart Ms Retno Marsudi on a number of occasions recently. She visited Singapore for her introductory visit on 26 November 2014 and I visited Jakarta in December 2014 to have discussions with her and other Indonesian leaders. Similarly, many of our Ministers and officials have good ties with their counterparts in President Joko’s Administration and are committed to advancing the relationship.",2,3,012-002-093-002-037-003,637

2015-01-20,Cost of Providing Free Transport for Older Singaporeans,012-002-093-002-039,Mr Seah Kian Peng,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) what is the cost of providing free MRT and bus rides to all Singaporeans above 60 years old, 65 years old, and 67 years old respectively; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider providing free transport to all Singaporeans above 67 years old.",1,1,012-002-093-002-039-001,644
2015-01-20,Cost of Providing Free Transport for Older Singaporeans,012-002-093-002-039,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"  It is difficult to estimate the costs as the travel patterns of the senior citizen group can vary considerably with different policies in place, and because we only have the data of those who hold the senior citizen concession card, and not that of the entire senior citizen population.",1,2,012-002-093-002-039-002,645
2015-01-20,Cost of Providing Free Transport for Older Singaporeans,012-002-093-002-039,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"That said, to give an idea of the costs for which the Member has requested, the annual cost of travel incurred by the 580,000 senior citizen card holders, all of whom are Singaporeans 60 years old and above, is about $200 million annually. If we look only at the card holders who are 65 years old and above, and 67 years old and above, the cost is about $125 million and $95 million respectively. With free travel, the travel patterns may change and the estimates may rise due to induced travel demand. Furthermore, the population of all Singaporeans 60 years old and above is about 660,000 today and rising, more than the 580,000 senior citizen card holders, and therefore the estimates are on the low side.",2,3,012-002-093-002-039-003,646
2015-01-20,Cost of Providing Free Transport for Older Singaporeans,012-002-093-002-039,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Another consideration would be that all senior citizens who are 60 years old and above already enjoy today, generous discounts of 25% to 59% off adult fares, depending on the distance they travel. Senior citizens who travel frequently can also cap their public transport expenditure by using the monthly concession pass priced at $60.",3,4,012-002-093-002-039-004,647
2015-01-20,Cost of Providing Free Transport for Older Singaporeans,012-002-093-002-039,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Given these generous discounts, and the significant additional cost taxpayers and other commuters will have to foot, I am not sure we need or should move to completely free travel for our senior citizens at this time. We will, however, revisit this issue from time to time, and we will continue to pay very close attention to fare affordability for vulnerable groups of Singaporeans, including senior citizens.",4,5,012-002-093-002-039-005,648

2015-01-20,Increasing Current Minimum Annual Leave Entitlement under Employment Act,012-002-093-002-041,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"  The Employment Act (EA) stipulates minimum labour standards to be complied by all employers and so ought to be kept basic. Under the EA, an employee who has served an employer for at least three months is entitled to seven days of paid annual leave in the first year of service. Subsequently, for every year of service with the same employer, he is entitled to an additional one day’s paid annual leave, up to 14 days. However, employers are encouraged to consider more generous leave benefits as a strategy to attract good workers in this tight labour market.",1,2,012-002-093-002-041-002,653
