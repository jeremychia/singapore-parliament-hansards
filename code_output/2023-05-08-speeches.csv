We have taken – and we must continue to take – a clear stand that is consistent with our principles and our national interests. In the Ministerial Statement of 28 February 2022 on the ""Situation in Ukraine and Its Implications"", Singapore strongly condemned Russia’s attack on Ukraine. The invasion of a sovereign country is a gross violation of the principles of the UN Charter and of international law.",1,2,014-002-095-102-004-002,25

2023-05-08,Singapore's Position on Russian-Ukraine War One Year On,014-002-095-102-004,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have three supplementary questions for the Foreign Minister. The first is to ask whether the Foreign Ministry was aware beforehand that the speech on 8 March was going to be delivered by the Minister for Home Affairs. So, the first question is whether the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) knew beforehand that the speech was being given and did MFA know the contents of the speech?",1,5,014-002-095-102-004-005,28
2023-05-08,Singapore's Position on Russian-Ukraine War One Year On,014-002-095-102-004,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The second question is, earlier, Minister Shanmugam mentioned that Indivisible Security is perhaps a concept in International Relations. So, I would like to ask the Foreign Minister what is the Government's view of such a principle of Indivisible Security.",2,6,014-002-095-102-004-006,29
2023-05-08,Singapore's Position on Russian-Ukraine War One Year On,014-002-095-102-004,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"And last of all, does the Foreign Minister agree that accepting a principle of Indivisible Security is very risky for small countries like Singapore?",3,7,014-002-095-102-004-007,30

Because I think your supplementaries actually cover some of what Minister Shanmugam earlier said. So, can I just be clear as to whom you are asking these questions?",1,8,014-002-095-102-004-008,31

2023-05-08,Singapore's Position on Russian-Ukraine War One Year On,014-002-095-102-004,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"  Mr Deputy Speaker, let me state categorically – the statements of the Minister for Law reflect the views of the Government of Singapore. We know generally when each Minister is going to speak, we are aware of that. I must tell you we do not personally check every single line and sentence in our speeches and the speeches can evolve according to the circumstances of the event.",1,10,014-002-095-102-004-010,33

2023-05-08,Singapore's Position on Russian-Ukraine War One Year On,014-002-095-102-004,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Would the Foreign Minister agree that actually, the Government's statements on Russia's invasion on Ukraine have been consistent all this while and there has never been this attempt to say that the US or NATO has been somewhat contributory to the current state of affairs, which was something that the Minister for Law did say. So, I would like him to confirm that up to now, the Government has not taken this position and this is actually something new in the public domain.",2,15,014-002-095-102-004-015,38
2023-05-08,Singapore's Position on Russian-Ukraine War One Year On,014-002-095-102-004,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"  Mr Deputy Speaker, there is nothing new. Our position has been and will continue to be clear and consistent. I have said that on numerous occasions, not just in this House. Various Ministers have also said this, in various fora outside this House.",1,16,014-002-095-102-004-016,39
2023-05-08,Singapore's Position on Russian-Ukraine War One Year On,014-002-095-102-004,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"I must add that foreign policy is something which we all have to responsibility for, including the Opposition. I am very glad that in fact, the Opposition, of all parties, has ensured that politics stops at the border. I think I can quite safely say that on behalf of every single Member in this House, our position remains that it was wrong of Russia, it was a breach of international law and of the principles of the UN Charter for them to launch the invasion of Ukraine.",2,17,014-002-095-102-004-017,40
2023-05-08,Singapore's Position on Russian-Ukraine War One Year On,014-002-095-102-004,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"Having said that, I think we must also be very clear in our minds that there are a diversity of views. And when we are explaining these matters to the general public and to our population, or indeed, even in this House, it is not unreasonable to reflect the diversity of views. But reflecting the diversity of views does not alter our national position, based on a defence of our national interests and the principles which a small, tiny, city-state like us must subscribe to.",3,18,014-002-095-102-004-018,41

2023-05-08,Singapore's Position on Russian-Ukraine War One Year On,014-002-095-102-004,Ms Sylvia Lim,"  Thank you, Sir. Perhaps one final clarification. Earlier, Minister said that there is collective responsibility in the Cabinet and that the Law Minister's views reflect the views of the Government. In his speech, he actually said specifically that, in his view, the West and NATO were not uninvolved bystanders who had no role to play in the current situation. So, do I take it that that is the Government's view as well?",1,21,014-002-095-102-004-021,44
2023-05-08,Singapore's Position on Russian-Ukraine War One Year On,014-002-095-102-004,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"  Mr Deputy Speaker, let me again step back and take a strategic look at this. Why have we taken such a categorical stand? We have taken it because of the vulnerabilities of Singapore as a tiny city-state. And history is replete with tragedy and misfortune falling on small countries. As the Minister for Law just explained – both in his speech and reiterated in this House – ultimately, the victim is the smaller country. Ukraine and Ukrainians are paying the ultimate price.",1,22,014-002-095-102-004-022,45
2023-05-08,Singapore's Position on Russian-Ukraine War One Year On,014-002-095-102-004,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"So, our position is clear  that it is wrong, a breach of international law, a flagrant violation of the principles of the UN Charter, the primary victim is the smaller country and it is people who are paying the ultimate price.",2,23,014-002-095-102-004-023,46
2023-05-08,Singapore's Position on Russian-Ukraine War One Year On,014-002-095-102-004,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"If you want to get into a larger debate on foreign policy, then, I would draw your attention to the fact that we are not in Europe. We are in Southeast Asia. As we collectively craft a foreign policy that is both consistent and protects our national interests, I would say on a larger strategic stage, we must always be aware. In fact, if you do not mind, let me recite what I said a year ago  ""The events in Ukraine go to the heart of the fundamental norms of international law and the UN Charter that prohibits the use of force and acts of aggression against another sovereign state. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a clear and gross violation of the international norms, a completely unacceptable precedent. This is an existential issue for us. Ukraine is much smaller than Russia, but it is much bigger than Singapore. A world order based on might is right or where the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must, such a world order is profoundly inimicable to the security and survival of small states. And so, we cannot accept one country attacking another without justification, arguing that its independence was a result of historical errors or crazy decisions. Such a rationale would go against internationally recognised legitimacy and the territorial integrity of many countries including Singapore.""",3,24,014-002-095-102-004-024,47
2023-05-08,Singapore's Position on Russian-Ukraine War One Year On,014-002-095-102-004,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"So, I think these are matters on which we are all agreed. You can get into the historical details of how a situation unfolded. Our objective in Southeast Asia is not to let a repeat of the European tragedy occur here, in this part of the world. In trying to avoid a parallel of that situation here, I think it is entirely legitimate for us to consider all views, diverse views, opposing views even, on how the situation in Europe came about.",4,25,014-002-095-102-004-025,48
2023-05-08,Singapore's Position on Russian-Ukraine War One Year On,014-002-095-102-004,,"I would urge the Member to understand what is at state, understand why we have taken a stand, understand why that stand has to be maintained, upheld and I hope, shared across the House by all the parties represented here; and also agree that we must not let a repeat of Europe – a continent which unfortunately has been a source of two world wars in the last century – we do not want a repeat of that here.",1,26,014-002-095-102-004-026,49
2023-05-08,Singapore's Position on Russian-Ukraine War One Year On,014-002-095-102-004,,"And finally, remember that a small nation is always vulnerable. And again, to repeat something I have said multiple times here, never let ourselves be a vassal state, a stalking horse, a cat's paw of any other power. Understand that when we get entangled in such matters, the ultimate loser is always the smaller state.

DI is not the primary way in which we safeguard the interests of depositors, be they small or large.

Its adequacy as a safety net can be assessed by looking at the proportion of depositors who are fully insured – in other words, the depositors whose aggregated eligible deposits at a bank are within the DI coverage limit. The DI coverage limit in Singapore was last raised in 2019 from $50,000 to $75,000 per depositor per participating financial institution. At $75,000, it fully insured 91% of depositors covered under the DI Scheme at the time.

Our principal objective should be to ensure that the pre-emptive safeguards, which I described earlier, are in good shape. We will also have to adjust the nominal coverage limit for DI from time to time. However, raising the proportion of deposits that are fully insured or, in other words, to cover larger depositors, is not without costs to banks, which will often ultimately mean costs borne by bank customers themselves.

I have a concern with regard to the Minister of State's view and risk assessment in terms of digital bank runs in the future. I think things have evolved significantly since the last FSAP, as the Minister of State mentioned, in 2019.

I am actually mindful of considering the DI limits because it could have cost implications, as the Minister of State mentioned, for the banking sector as well as Singaporeans. If so, what is the cost of this increased DI coverage limit; whether the DI fund is adequately sized in terms of the pre-funding; and also whether the Minister of State can highlight, typically in other countries, for example, UK takes seven days for a depositor of a bank to get their money cash back. For Singapore, for example, how many days would it take for a depositor get his money if a bank goes bankrupt?",3,23,014-002-095-102-006-023,113

2023-05-08,Proposal to Review Cap of Coverage Per Depositor under Deposit Insurance,014-002-095-102-006,Mr Alvin Tan,"  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Let me go through the different questions one by one. With regard to the Member's question on digital banks, digital full banks are DI members of SDIC. In the initial restricted phase, they are limited to no more than $75,000 deposit per individual depositor. So, at that level, it will mean that all of the individual's deposits with a digital full bank would be fully covered. Digital wholesale banks are not subject to this cap but they cannot take retail deposits.",1,25,014-002-095-102-006-025,115

2023-05-08,Proposal to Review Cap of Coverage Per Depositor under Deposit Insurance,014-002-095-102-006,Mr Alvin Tan,"On the final question on the increase of the DI coverage limit, the DI scheme members pay regular premiums quite similar to what I explained earlier, to cover these deposits; and a higher coverage limit, of course, will require higher premiums. This adds naturally to the bank's overall costs, which they will have to manage themselves, and then, sometimes also pass on these costs to customers, given that they are commercial enterprises. They might do it through, perhaps, lower deposit rates, higher lending rates or other fees.",3,27,014-002-095-102-006-027,117

I would like to assure the Member and Members of this House that the DI fund is adequately sized. It is designed to meet a solvency standard of over 99.9%. What that means is that at this target fund size, the DI fund is able to make DI payments without losses at a confidence interval of 99.9%.",4,28,014-002-095-102-006-028,118

I am asking this supplementary question on behalf of Ms Joan Pereira who is on medical leave. She has a very strong conviction about asking this supplementary question, so I am conveying this question to Senior Minister of State. Can the Senior Minister of State consider asking polyclinics to consider prioritising walk-in patients who are seniors? Because Ms Joan Pereira is very particularly interested in making sure our seniors walking in, as well as those with mobility issues, are attended to, given that they may find it challenging to go to the GPs.

As I mentioned in my original answer, the walk-in residents, the walk-in patients are triaged and assessed, and part of that assessment will indeed be their state of frailty, and their age and their mobility are considered as part of that assessment. I think the right thing to do is to allow the professional judgement of the clinical team at the site to make the assessment as to the urgency of their needs, rather than set a very arbitrary cut-off in terms of an age for example, or other factors where actually the key thing is to assess the needs of that patient at that time.

And I thank that Senior Minister of State for the answer. I understand that the bus stop codes and names are displayed at the bus stop pole and the bus stop information board. However, the font that is used is relatively small and it is not easily visible to passengers as they are approaching the bus stop. So, it would not give them enough time to be able to press the button to indicate to the bus captain to stop the bus. In fact, the most prominent signage at the bus stop is actually the bus shelter address plate, which is on the top of the bus shelter because the font can be seen from quite a distance away, about 40 metres away at least, in my estimation. So this will give the commuters a bit more time to prepare to stop, to press the bell to stop the bus.",1,7,014-002-095-102-011-007,193

The National Parks Board (NParks) was first alerted to the incident in March 2022 through the OneService App and sought to arrange for its removal. Unfortunately, due to a miscommunication between agencies, the removal was not done and the case was closed prematurely.

The rental index of office spaces in Singapore has increased by an average of about 1.35% per annum in the last three years. While rental for office spaces is higher than the pre-pandemic level, it remains below historical peaks in 2008 and 2015. In the same period, the vacancy rate for office spaces has remained stable at around 11% to 13%.",1,2,014-002-095-102-015-002,223

This is about 40% higher, compared to the past three years combined, and can help to cater to the demand and moderate rent increases over time. Rental continues to comprise a modest proportion of overall business costs for most sectors in Singapore. The Government will continue to monitor the market.

I will give Members a quick example.

As a proportion of the total car population, PHCs have remained at around 10% for the past four years. In fact, the period where we saw the fastest growth in PHC numbers was between 2015 to 2017, where they increased from 30,000 to almost 70,000.

So, we should be careful when making calls about imposing caps, sometimes arbitrary, on the PHC population. That said, the PHCs are a relatively new development. The P2P regulatory framework, for example, only commenced in 2017 and COVID-19 has caused some disruption in the market.

The system also incorporates progressivity considerations by having different COE categories. In fact, when the COE system first started in 1990, there were four categories for cars. The number of categories was reduced to the current two in 1999, to address concerns over the relatively small quota supply and resultant volatility as well as limited choices of cars in some categories. Category E (Cat E), which is the Open category, was retained to allow for changing preferences and needs in vehicle types over time.",19,19,014-002-095-102-018-019,287

On the whole, the system continues to serve our policy objective of efficiently allocating the limited supply of COEs. However, over the years, the Ministry of Transport (MOT) and LTA have made various refinements to the VQS scheme, to ensure its relevance and efficacy without forsaking the core policy intent. The power rating criterion of 97 kilowatt (kW) was introduced in 2014 for the mass market Category A (Cat A), so that car COE categories are differentiated not just by engine capacity. Last year, as more electric car models became available in Singapore, we increased the power output threshold for Cat A COEs to 110 kilowatt hour (kWh) in order to accommodate mass market electric cars.",20,20,014-002-095-102-018-020,288

In other words, if I can put it the other way, Cat B OMVs in the median is about 75% higher compared to the median in Cat A. So, there is a clear differentiation although it may not be a complete dichotomisation of the market.

A key feature of the motorcycle market is that dealers bid and hold the temporary COEs (TCOEs) in their own name before transferring it to a motorcycle buyer. This is a deliberate design feature because it provides convenience for buyers who can readily purchase a motorcycle. This is unlike the car market where bids are primarily in the name of the buyer. The prospective car buyers who need immediate access to a car and in other words, a bid was not submitted in their name, can rely on Cat E COEs where there is some flexibility.",22,22,014-002-095-102-018-022,290

To Ms Mariam Jaafar’s query, the expired TCOEs were held by more than 50 dealers; and of course, those with a bigger market share contributed more, but there is a spread. The TCOE utilisation rates subsequently went back up, with the market correcting when it could not support the prevailing prices. This is what we mean by the market working as intended.

So, in comparison to median income, the COE price is actually lower – although in absolute terms, the price has risen. And the reason is because household incomes have risen. As household incomes continue to rise in the coming years, coupled with our policy of zero-growth in the car population, we must expect the long-term trajectory for COE prices to be upwards.",32,32,014-002-095-102-018-032,300

So, I would say that, that is not the source of the problem, so let us diagnose this correctly. The issue is not the system or how it is being administered per se. The issue is really around supply and some level of volatility that we are trying to mitigate, as well as where we can or where we discern, some need to intervene because of either speculation or some inefficiencies in the market.

But I would like to ask the Minister whether another reason why the COE prices may be at this level, this recent wave, is because the disparity in the purchasing power among the bidders now. In other words, there are, in each batch of the COE bidding, there are more bidders that have higher purchasing power and therefore the ability to pay up; and that is where the COE prices is.

Because as I explained earlier, overall, if you look at it over a 10-year cycle, peak to peak, our incomes have risen. And to the extent that cars remain and aspirational or a necessity, an aspirational product or a necessity, then you must expect that there will be a propensity to want to allocate budget to buy that and the prices will reflect to some extent, the trends in incomes as well. That is why I gave the numbers that I did. That is not to say that that is the only factor but generally, if you compare it to incomes rising and so on, I think that does tell us an important story.",1,50,014-002-095-102-018-050,318

We have 470,000 households in Singapore that own cars. That is about 36% to 37% – so, it is a very sizeable proportion of our population base. And so, I think what we have been trying to do is, through a combination of ownership and usage measures, make cars available as widely as possible, but within our zero-growth constraint, which we have imposed for good reasons.

If we say a proportion of COEs are balloted and the rest are not, then the question is  so we have a market where you bid and you secure; and then, there is another segment which is by luck of the draw, literally. How do we price that? Do you price it at the same price as the COE in that period? Or do you say no, it is a discounted price. If it is a discounted price, then it is a windfall for the party that gets this, because they will then be able to resell the car with the COE at a higher price because the market clearing price is higher. Then, the question is  what justifies such a ballot, who qualifies and how do we do it?",3,52,014-002-095-102-018-052,320
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"I am just sharing this with Members, because I appreciate the intent behind the suggestion, but I am trying to point out that there are several, quite intractable, second- and third-order issues we will have to deal with. And we will very quickly move from discussing COE prices to wondering why the balloting system is not working. And indeed, we do have discussions like that in this House as well. So, a balloting system is not a panacea. In fact, it may aggravate the problems, if the concern is around price and unevenness in the market.",4,53,014-002-095-102-018-053,321

2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have two clarifications, one is in relation to the COE, whether the Ministry has conducted any public surveys to better understand and aim at discovering what are the factors that would persuade more private vehicle owners to switch to public transport. Another one is in an effort to reduce carbon footprint, what is the current ratio of the single- to double-decker buses currently in service, and whether the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has plans to move towards 100% double-decker buses, to maximise the ridership capacity and thereby, an effort to reduce the carbon footprint?",1,55,014-002-095-102-018-055,323

2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"  Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Member for her questions or clarifications. Factors that will persuade the car owners to switch – I think there are several and I have talked about some of them. The most important thing that we need to do is populate the spectrum of commuting choices available to Singaporeans. The more we are able to offer a high-quality public transport system and near-car kind of services, whether it is car sharing, your P2Ps and so on, and if we can also make the first mile last mile part of the commute a better one, then I think people who choose to pay the sum that they pay, or the sums that they pay to buy a car, will have reason to take a pause and re-evaluate the choices that they make.",1,57,014-002-095-102-018-057,325
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"But in the end, every individual is entitled to make their allocative decisions. But what we are really trying to do is make the alternatives as compelling as possible. And in fact, you hear this more from people who have lived overseas and come here. I was recently at an American Chamber of Commerce dialogue. And one of the ladies said she came from the US where she was wholly reliant on her car. She was waxing lyrical about our public transport system and her teenage daughter who studied here, used our public transport system, has since gone to the US for her further studies in Houston. According to her, the daughter laments that the public transport system in the US is not of the same quality and accessibility as here.",2,58,014-002-095-102-018-058,326
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"So, we do have advocates and I am very keen to get more of such advocates, especially Singaporeans.

Of course, there are always areas we can improve.",3,59,014-002-095-102-018-059,327
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"That is also why I cited the survey – there is a perceptible shift in the preferences of the younger generation of Singaporeans. They are more adept at using technology and some of the solutions already available. As a result, they are less seized with the need to buy a car. In fact, they think there are other ways of using their money. And I say, good for them, in that regard.",4,60,014-002-095-102-018-060,328

But I will put it this way, the move for sustainability is the thrust of the Member's question. The main way we are seeking to ensure sustainability is through electrification. So, our bus fleet, we have about 6,000 buses in the public bus fleet. And about half of these will be electric by 2030; the other half will be a hybrid solution, so that is how we are moving.",5,61,014-002-095-102-018-061,329

Would the Minister consider alternative ways of allocating the vehicle quota based on other factors, instead of just price alone? For example, maybe a point-based system, where apart from the bidding price, we also consider other factors like nationality, and needs-based factors, like families with young children or persons with disability.",1,64,014-002-095-102-018-064,332

2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,  The Member has raised a few questions. Let me try and deal with them.,1,66,014-002-095-102-018-066,334
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"A point-based system – it is really a variation of the idea that Mr Liang Eng Hwa talked about, a ballot. Because in the end, you have got to decide how you would allocate the points, on what basis? And how will that then factor into the final COE allocation? Does that mean that if someone has got more points, then they are entitled to a different price when it comes to the COE? Or does it mean that they go into a different pool? And if they go into a different pool, how do we segment the pools?",2,67,014-002-095-102-018-067,335
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"So, I think a point-based system has the same kind of, in a sense, the kind of arbitrariness that we are trying to avoid. We are trying to let the market work itself through. We do have schemes where we help people – for example, those who have special needs or persons with disability who need vehicles for say, work and so on, we do have schemes to help them with that, including with the COEs and so on.",3,68,014-002-095-102-018-068,336

2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"It is not unlike what we do, for example, electricity in Singapore. We price electricity fully. We do not subsidise it. We do not say ""first hundred units X, next hundred units Y"". We price it all the same, because every one, from the beginning, is a unit of electricity. But then what we do, is we provide U-Save rebates and so on. So, if we want to help certain categories of people, it is best to do it that way.",5,70,014-002-095-102-018-070,338
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"Then, the Member makes a point about needs-based. And I am quite sympathetic to her point, because many families say to me  ""Look, I have got children and I need to take them around to enrichment classes on the weekends and so on, and public transport does not quite work for me"". And then, we have others who say  ""Look, I have got elderly parents, whom I need to take to hospital or for medical appointments"", and so on. I think if you look at households in Singapore, they will either have children or elderly parents they have to look after, that will probably cover most households in Singapore.",6,71,014-002-095-102-018-071,339
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"So, everyone has a need that I think we can understand. The real question for us is, do we have the resources and the capacity to meet that need effectively? That is where the challenge lies. I mean, I would be very happy if we had a cornucopia of COEs that we can just dispense at will – but we do not, because of the constraints I have highlighted. And that is why we have to make some tough choices in the allocative sense.",7,72,014-002-095-102-018-072,340
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"Having said that, we are working on, and in fact, we do have some alternatives, as I have said, for persons with disability and so on, we have got certain targeted measures. Also, car-sharing services, because these allow households to have a car for a few hours to do what they need to do, and then come back and leave the car for somebody else to use. So, that actually is a more efficient outcome, and in fact, it would save households a lot more money than buying a car and incurring the depreciation.

My question is  as we still have Singaporeans aspiring to own cars and we are trying to go car-lite, I think these are the sort of issues that I am hearing from your Statement, we are not moving away from in anytime soon – car-lite, zero-growth, we are a very small country and the push towards public transport.

There is going to be a time transition for people to move away from their aspirations. My question is, if you go towards the holistic approach or to the car-lite strategy and zero-growth, how can we improve our P2P, PHC and taxi services? Because the exasperation of Singaporeans on the ground, if they want to move away from a private car, but they want to wait for taxis and PHCs, and these are not there, every single minute when they want to have access to it, 24 hours of the day and at any time, is something that will need to be addressed.

Mr Deputy Speaker, with your permission, just to address one other point about ABSD that was raised. If the Member's intent is that, we should have progressivity in the COE system, actually, we already have significant progressivity through the tax system, the ARF system that we have today, in terms of the cars. In fact, the Finance Minister announced a whole set of moves to further increase the gradient and the progressivity.",1,84,014-002-095-102-018-084,352

2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"On Mr Saktiandi's points, first is can we do more to increase the supply of the P2P, the private hire cars – and we use all these terms interchangeably – and taxis and so on. The bottom line is we need to try all measures to enhance the availability of car-like – not car-lite – but car-like services. Because what people really value is the flexibility to be able to hop into a car and go to multiple locations in a certain period of time and come back. But it is a waste to have the car sitting in the carpark, when you are not using it for hours, when you only need it maybe a few hours in a week. That is the crux of it.",3,86,014-002-095-102-018-086,354

What we can do in terms of more in the P2P sector and the PHCs. I have a smile on my face because the Member is asking for whether we can do more and have more PHCs. I think I have just heard from others advocating quite the opposite. So, you understand the conundrum, I think.",4,87,014-002-095-102-018-087,355

2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"So, we are working on a whole range of ideas on this, how we can do more. And I accept the Member's point that there is a transition. The transition is not just in terms of going to car-lite, but also because it would take us at least about 10 years more before our MRT system comes to that level where we really have good connectivity in many parts. We already have pretty good connectivity, by the way; but this will take it at least a notch higher and we will be comparable to the best cities in the world.",6,89,014-002-095-102-018-089,357
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"So, the key thing is to manage the transition. And as I said, it is about populating the choice spectrum, giving people a whole range of options from public transport at one end to private car ownership on the other, and everything in between. I think the more we can populate that choice spectrum and give people the information and the convenience to exercise that choice, I think then we are on the right path.",7,90,014-002-095-102-018-090,358

And it is not just for one or two quarters because LTA will be releasing more information. Essentially, we have got five-year COEs that will expire probably in about three- or four-years' time and that is when you are really going to know, if you look at the historical cycles, there is going to be a sort of peak-ish. If you go on that everybody who is reaching their 10-year mark is going to de-register, then you are going to be at a peak.",8,91,014-002-095-102-018-091,359

And these will be redeployed – in not just this quarter, the next quarter but in the next few quarters at least, leading up to this. Because essentially, it is, as one of my colleagues put it, a cut and fill exercise. You are really trying to smoothen the curve, try and avoid too sharp a gradient and worse, the volatility, the ups and downs. That is what we are trying to do.",9,92,014-002-095-102-018-092,360

I think the Minister will know I have spoken on this a number of times, including on 1 March where I asked for more measures to deter speculative bidding. And I think what you mentioned about the main measures suggest that you do now recognise that beyond supply and demand, speculative behaviour by dealers who have the incentives to bid up prices actually is a factor, and especially so, it is amplified in a market where we are talking about a few hundred COEs every month.",1,95,014-002-095-102-018-095,363
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang),"And I think what sits with us is that we all feel that this is particularly egregious when the people who bear the brunt of these actions by dealers, are people who are the lowest income workers, students who are holding part-time jobs because they need to earn. I guess my clarification is, can we do more to close down these loopholes a bit faster? How can we be more responsive? One suggestion could be – I mean $200, $800, $1,500 is a bit arbitrary. Could we tie the dealer deposits to the size of their bids, to be a bit more quicker to rein in speculative bidding? Two, could we allow for individuals to bid, like we have in cars, for motorcycles also? And three, is there a way to provide more transparency on individual dealer bidding practices?",2,96,014-002-095-102-018-096,364

The Minister mentioned that they are currently still studying the impact of PHCs on COE prices. And so, I want to just clarify, is there no evidence? Do you feel that there is no evidence today that the PHCs are driving up CEO prices? I mean the market works, but it is also not a level playing field as we know. They have ways to pass on higher prices and also, the ability to convert some of these PHCs into private cars, although, of course, there is a market for that.",3,97,014-002-095-102-018-097,365

And how did it correct? Well, those who were left with very expensive COEs realised that they cannot sell the motorcycles with those COEs and they then had to give up the COEs or they forfeited them. And we then have to recycle that into the market.",3,101,014-002-095-102-018-101,369
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"What happens then is, just to be very clear, before we made the latest move, such as the reduction of the validity period, was that the supply that is forfeited cannot be returned to the market until the next quarter. So, there is a lag of at least 10 to 12 weeks before it goes back. And what we wanted to do was to re-channel quicker. So, we shortened the validity period and then the motorcycle dealers can decide what they want.",4,102,014-002-095-102-018-102,370

2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"If you take $1,500 for example, it is something like – well, at least before this recent correction which may or may not be sustained – but it is about 10% or so and it is of a similar order of magnitude to what we have for COEs for cars. So, there is a certain method in it. Why do we exercise restraint and caution in raising the bid deposit, simply because, precisely what the Member says. If we inadvertently, through our policy moves, because deposits are very high, cause motorcycle prices to rise even further, then it will harm precisely the group that the Member wants to help.",6,104,014-002-095-102-018-104,372

The answer is yes, there can be; but the market practice in general is that motorcycle buyers have a preference to just be able to go in and buy in the shops. This is why we have had this arrangement for motorcycle dealers. But there is nothing really that stops us from accommodating this and in fact we do already.",8,106,014-002-095-102-018-106,374

Well, I would like to draw the Member's attention to what I said in my Ministerial Statement. Basically, in a period, for example 2015 to 2017, when the PHC population grew from 30,000 to 70,000 or nearly 70,000, so doubling, the impact on COE prices was not particularly discernible.

PHCs are a relatively new phenomenon and it is a very variegated terrain. It is not just your Grabs; you have got your car-sharing guys, you have got the rental guys who then lease to the drivers and so on. So, there is a whole variety. So, it is important that we understand this correctly before we decide whether there is a need to act because they have an impact that perhaps distorts a market and then if so, then what are those targeted measures. And that is what the Ministry of Transport and LTA are studying.",12,110,014-002-095-102-018-110,378

I have some quick clarifications pertaining to public transport. In the new fare adjustment formula, how is the productivity contribution quantum of 0.1% derived? Are these all the productivity gains that MOT is expecting the PTOs to achieve and could that be too low an expectation?",1,112,014-002-095-102-018-112,380
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Secondly, how closely and – related to that – how closely does LTA work with the PTO to conceive and implement productivity enhancing measures and how can LTA be sure that the PTOs do not treat the 0.1% productivity contribution as a cost of doing business without significant productivity gains that will reduce costs over the long term and help to stave off future fare hikes?",2,113,014-002-095-102-018-113,381
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"And lastly, when PTOs rationalise bus services – for example, the removal of bus services 22, 66 and 506 for my residents in Bedok Reservoir in 2022 and 2021, sorry I am not letting go of this – which saves the Government $9.5 million a year in subsidies, how are these cost savings passed to commuters?",3,114,014-002-095-102-018-114,382

2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"First, the formula – I think it is important to understand that 0.1% is a productivity contribution, but it is a deduction from the fare increase. So, leaving aside, for example, the recent periods when it is 12% or 13% and so on, if you look at in general, let us say you have a year when the fare increases 2%. When I extract 0.1% from you, if the fare increase is 1%, I am extracting 10% from you; 2% is 5%. If it is a 3% increase, then 3.3% and so on. So, it is actually quite a sizeable imposition on the PTOs. It is not a free pass by any means.",2,116,014-002-095-102-018-116,384

I think this is an important thing. It is a win-win. It is not something where we want LTA to just dictate and be left with it. We see this as a joint endeavour and that is why many of the moves that are being made, in terms of technology, fuel efficiencies and so on, these are all areas that we are working together with the PTOs on.",3,117,014-002-095-102-018-117,385
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"On the Member's point on rationalising bus services and, when there are savings, how does it get passed through to commuters? So, if I may, like the Member, persevere and persist with my counterpoints, the fact is that we are subsidising bus services a billion dollars a year. We are not recovering costs by any stretch. So, any savings are ploughed back into the system and it just gets distributed at large. But the bottom line is that we are subsidising public transport significantly. A billion dollars for bus, a billion dollars for train, or, if you want to think about it in another way, every journey gets a $1 subsidy. That is not counting those who are on concession passes and those who are buying the concession fares; those who get concession fares and also the concession passes.",4,118,014-002-095-102-018-118,386
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"So, by all accounts – and I think being very objective – we are making a strong effort to ensure that our public transport system remains affordable. If you look at international comparisons, the answer is we are. And if you look at our own pattern over time, expenditure on public transport, as a percentage of household expenses, actually, over the last 10 years, it has been declining for the quintile, decile, almost all the key metrics that we look at.",5,119,014-002-095-102-018-119,387
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"So, my point is, we will continue to do our best to keep public transport affordable. There is a significant amount of subsidy. When we get savings, it is basically ploughed back into the system. We cannot do it at the particular service level; it has to be at the aggregated level. But in the end, what really has an impact on the final expenditure incurred by the commuter is the subsidy that the Government gives, and that is not insubstantial.",6,120,014-002-095-102-018-120,388

Just two questions for the Minister for Transport and they are quite narrow, relating to the volatility or trying to manage the volatility in COE prices. So, the first question is  with regard to car loan restrictions, which are now at seven years and at 70% of the selling price, is the Ministry intending to look at the loopholes vis a vis these car loan curbs, because it is not uncommon to hear of dealerships offering 100% loans and things of that nature. That is the first question.",1,128,014-002-095-102-018-128,396
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"The second question pertains to the continuing relevance of the Cat E COE, the open category. Unlike Cat A and Cat B, which we know are tied to car registration numbers, the Cat E COE can be traded for up to three months, if I recall correctly. So, there is a potential speculative vector in Cat E COEs. I would like to know what is MOT's view on the continued relevance of Cat E COEs and whether removing that category altogether can help towards a smoother COE system.",2,129,014-002-095-102-018-129,397

2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to the Leader of the Opposition. Just to be very clear, we are not talking about volatility in prices. That is not the objective of the exercise. It is volatility in supply. How prices eventuate in the market – as I have discussed and all of us know – is a function of various factors that are taking place. Today the prices may go down, tomorrow they may go up. We think that the long-term trajectory is upwards for the reasons I have mentioned. Our supply is basically zero growth. So, it is capped. And the demand is a function, among other things, of incomes, and incomes are rising. So, we must be prepared for this.",1,131,014-002-095-102-018-131,399
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"So, if every time COE prices go up, we approach it as some kind of a new phenomenon, I think we should take pause and understand that these are the fundamentals that we are dealing with. It is a hard choice we have to make. And the decision to have a zero vehicle growth rate is a very hard choice.",2,132,014-002-095-102-018-132,400

Was there a Parliamentary Question on this already? Today or? Maybe I will allow my colleague, Alvin Tan, to reply. But let me just say this. Loans are under the purview of MAS and, if it is hire purchase, then I think it is under the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI). But the key point I want to make is that the moves we are making from the MOT and LTA perspectives are really in order to ensure the market functions as we intended and to smoothen the supply and that is why we are going for this.",4,134,014-002-095-102-018-134,402
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"On the Member's second question on the relevance of Cat E, first, we need to size the thing correctly. Cat E has 10% only. Of Cat A and Cat B, 10% goes into Cat E, alright? So, why do we do that?",5,135,014-002-095-102-018-135,403
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"Essentially, when you have a system which has got — and we have had basically a Cat E component from the very beginning, and why is that important? When you have got these very fixed categories, you need a mechanism, a valve, if you will, that can help redistribute some because preferences may change over time. There may be a greater shift towards Cat A, there may be a greater shift to bigger cars, there may be other kinds of movements. We do not know. So, this really creates a valve in the system. It is a valve that we have actually been progressively throttling down. In fact, in the early days, it was much more – the contribution from the different categories – and today it is 10%. So, it is at a level we—of course, as I have said, with COEs and the system, the Government has always been reviewing and constantly evaluating the relevance of measures. But I am just trying to give the context for the Leader of the Opposition's benefit.",6,136,014-002-095-102-018-136,404
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"So, it serves an important purpose. I do not think it is a purpose that is irrelevant in today's context by any means and for the foreseeable future. But if there are some other efforts to think about the design of the system, then, at that point, maybe this can be revisited. So, the reason why you cannot say I create a valve but then I restrict its usage. That is why you need the flexibility. If you cannot trade it and apply it to different categories and give them enough time to do that, then you may as well not have the category. So, the design and the features are tied specifically to the intent behind having the category. Alvin, would you like to say something?",7,137,014-002-095-102-018-137,405

I have two supplementary questions on the Cat E COE. As what the Minister has said, the contribution of Cat E COE is from 10% of deregistered Cats A, B and C. I want to ask the Minister why do we want to contribute from C where it is mainly used for commercial vehicles and all the Category E COEs are mainly to register Cat B COE, which means that you are shrinking the Cat C COEs meant for commercial vehicles.",1,141,014-002-095-102-018-141,409

2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"As I said earlier in my Ministerial Statement, for the bidding quarter we are having now, that it will increase supply by 24%. I think that is quite substantial. And Cat B, in fact, the five-year COEs that are available for Cat B, we are a lot less and that is why also consequently, you see a much lower percentage increase of about 15%.",8,151,014-002-095-102-018-151,419

2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I have two questions for the Minister.",1,153,014-002-095-102-018-153,421
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"One is the whole discussion here actually is about prices going too fast up, too high and also about equity. When prices go up high, many Singaporeans will not be able to afford. So, one of the grievances that I have also heard from some residents is that that the Cat A and the Cat B, a lot of the expensive cars are now going down to Cat A. So, as a result, in order to ensure more equity amongst Singaporeans, the lower-income can still cars, the cheaper cars, will the Minister putting OMV as an additional criterion for classifying Cat A? That is one question.",2,154,014-002-095-102-018-154,422
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member),"The second question is that, for the recent phenomenon we have seen in the motorcycle market, it has indicated that the Government do have some leverage on controlling the prices in the motorcycle COE market. With the recent collapse, I think it is a reflection that not enough has been done in the past. Going forward, will the Minister say that the Government will be more careful because the price of the motorcycle is very important for many of our working Singaporeans; so, to be more careful in maybe controlling the prices of the motorcycle COE?",3,155,014-002-095-102-018-155,423
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"  Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence, can I just understand  so, does the Member think that lowering of the price is good or bad? I mean, I am trying to understand. When the Member said ""be more careful"", what does he mean?",1,156,014-002-095-102-018-156,424
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"  Minister, lowering is good. We will prefer to have a lower price.",1,157,014-002-095-102-018-157,425
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"  So, if I may just ask one other question while you are at the lectern. Because I took considerable pains to explain this. Does the Member agree that with the supply limited, in fact, capped at zero growth and incomes are rising that the almost unavoidable conclusion is that the prices must rise?",1,158,014-002-095-102-018-158,426
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"  Deputy Speaker, to answer the Minister, yes, we agree to many of the things that the Minister has said. For example, we have to control car population; as a result, we require the COE system to allocate the COEs, limited supply.",1,159,014-002-095-102-018-159,427
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr Leong Mun Wai,"But, however, I think the Government should also be careful when prices go up too fast, there will be problems, problem from the aspect of affordability and also from the aspects of equity. So, as a result, what the discussion today is actually about that, that prices have gone up too much. Like the motorcycle COE, has gone up multiple times over the last two years. So, we prefer a lower price.",2,160,014-002-095-102-018-160,428
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"  We all prefer lower prices, Mr Leong. Let us be very clear about that. We all want to help the people who buy cars and motorbikes. I do not think you have a monopoly of virtue in that regard. The real question here is and if I hear you correctly, you accept that the long-term trend in prices must be up. So, now, your point is more about the rate of change and whether that can be something that can be done.",1,161,014-002-095-102-018-161,429
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"If I can take Member's second question first. We do not control prices. I want to put that categorically on the table because we are not stipulating the price or even a range. The only thing that the Government is able to do is settle on the supply and if there are any mechanics in the system, whether there are reasons to adjust them. That is what we have been doing. How that flows into the market or works through the market is also dependent on demand, as the Member would know and finally, the price outcome is how the market settles it.",2,162,014-002-095-102-018-162,430
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"We know that the Cat D price has come down. But does this mean that this is the new level? I think even if you listen to the industry players, they would advocate that we watch this for a while because whether it is buyers or dealers, they all have to sort of assess the situation and the market will have to find a new equilibrium. Where that is, I cannot say. But what I can say with certainty is that in the long term, we will see upward price pressure for the fundamental realities we have discussed. So, we do not control prices. Please do not advocate that.",3,163,014-002-095-102-018-163,431
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"Secondly, Mr Leong makes this political point about higher COE prices and many Singaporeans cannot afford. The sub-text here is somehow it is foreigners who are buying it – because if Singaporeans cannot afford it, who is buying it? So, that is the Member's implication. I want the Member to be upfront about it because I have taken pains to point out again that the proportion of foreigners buying cars has remained low and stable.",4,164,014-002-095-102-018-164,432
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"So, yes, what is happening is actually and the correct characterisation may well be that when the COE price goes up, some people will find it more difficult to afford; other people may find it easier to afford. So, there is a re-allocation and distribution going on within our society. And that is one of the things. It is a politically uncomfortable thing but it is a reality. And I would urge the Member to be careful in the way he makes this point; otherwise, we give wrong conclusions and we end up distorting the discussion.",5,165,014-002-095-102-018-165,433

2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,  Thank you. The other point that the Member makes is on OMV and whether OMV should be used as the basis for categories.,1,168,014-002-095-102-018-168,436
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"I had addressed the Member's point in my Ministerial Statement. The median OMV for Cat B is about 70%, 75% more and the median OMV for Cat A. That means actually the market is already quite separated; I mean, you have the separation in terms of value. The next thing is we have achieved this or this is the outcome but the criteria, we are using our objective criteria – engine capacity, power output, what I have described earlier. And our objective has always been to make sure that these criteria are able to accommodate the mass market models in the Cat A, as far as possible. That was one of the reasons for the recent adjustment so that the mass market electric vehicle models could also be in captured.",2,169,014-002-095-102-018-169,437
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"But is there going to be some movement on the margin? Yes. So, you will see, as the Member has put it, some of the more expensive type cars migrating to the Cat A. But by the same token, we also have what are considered generally as mass market cars that are actually in Cat B. Examples will be some of the SUVs like, it is a Subaru Impreza and Mitsubishi something or other. Because of their engine capacity, two litres, they are in Cat B.",3,170,014-002-095-102-018-170,438
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"What I am trying to say is it is not a clean cut. And the problem with using an OMV, amongst other things, is that the OMV is not something that is objective criteria because there are a lot of other variables. For example, if exchange rates move, the OMV of the car changes. So, how would you account for that?",4,171,014-002-095-102-018-171,439
2023-05-08,Meeting the Transport Needs of Singaporeans,014-002-095-102-018,Mr S Iswaran,"When we are making these recommendations, let us keep this in mind that there are many moving parts. But the fundamental objective, which is the point that the Member is also driving at, we want to ensure that there is an element of progressivity in our COE system. And that is why we have two categories. And, as I said in my Ministerial Statement, we will continue to look at this and if there is a need to adjust the criteria that divides the two categories, we will look at it. But as of now, there is no compelling reason and certainly not to use the OMV.",5,172,014-002-095-102-018-172,440

Following her divorce, she had care and control of the parties’ two young children; her ex-husband was ordered to pay child maintenance at $1,500 a month. Two years after the divorce, Mdm A had not received any maintenance payments, though she had taken out enforcement proceedings. She was left to support her two children and elderly parents alone.",7,18,014-002-095-102-021-018,477
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr K Shanmugam,"This is how she described her frustrations in an email that she sent to me, and I quote  “Monies have to be spent each [time] an individual seeks legal advice; monies that most ex-spouses can ill-afford. Perhaps this is why most give up the fight, because they can no longer afford to pay for another Court hearing and receive another ruling that will not be enforced.”",8,19,014-002-095-102-021-019,478
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr K Shanmugam,"The second case, I will call the lady Mdm B. Like Mdm A, Mdm B also had care and control of the parties’ two young children, and her ex-husband was ordered to maintain her and the children at $1,500 per month. But for five years, from 2017 to 2022, Mdm B did not receive any payments from her ex-husband, save for a one-time payment of $50, even after she had filed multiple enforcement applications. For his breaches, the ex-husband was sentenced to prison, one to two days each time, but he still did not pay, despite having the means to pay. By 2022, the child maintenance arrears, accumulated over 61 months, was a total of $91,000. So, how did Mdm B cope? She coped single-handedly to support her children through primary school and borrowed from friends and neighbours.",9,20,014-002-095-102-021-020,479
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr K Shanmugam,What I have just described for Mdm A and Mdm B is the unfortunate reality for some. It arises because some husbands just refuse to pay and I am referring to those who can pay but would not pay. It is quite separate if they just cannot pay. I will come back to this later.,10,21,014-002-095-102-021-021,480

2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr K Shanmugam,"If you look at the issues, first, there are limited means of obtaining information on the parties’ assets and means. This makes it difficult to distinguish between respondents who cannot pay maintenance and those who simply refuse to pay because the information is not fully in. And this then often leads to a second problem which is repeat non-compliance.",12,23,014-002-095-102-021-023,482

2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr K Shanmugam,"There is one further area of change to the maintenance enforcement process, which is not shown in the infographic. Under the existing law, an applicant who suspects that a respondent intends to dissipate, or has dissipated assets to frustrate the maintenance claim, can apply for an injunction or a clawback order. However, the applicant will likely face evidential difficulties in proving the respondent's intent to dissipate property specifically to frustrate a maintenance order.",16,47,014-002-095-102-021-047,506
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr K Shanmugam,"To address this, we will create a rebuttable presumption of the respondent's intent to dissipate.

The amendments will align the position under the Family Justice Act with that in section 43 of the State Courts Act. Depending on the circumstances of the case, in certain situations, instead of incurring time and costs in enforcement or bankruptcy proceedings, it may be more sensible and in the interests of both parties, for the Court to grant a short reprieve to the judgment debtor, or to allow the judgment debtor to pay the judgment creditor by way of instalments.

It is only after disposing the matrimonial property that the issue of the children's interest not being sufficiently safeguarded came to the fore. In such cases, the parent who has custody of the children may then make an appeal to HDB for urgent accommodation presenting HDB with a fait accompli.

The MRO has quasi-judicial powers similar to what is being proposed for the MEO. This includes the power to interview parties to the proceedings; and obtain documents and information on the financial circumstances of a party to proceedings from the party directly or from any other person, with the consent of the party. In addition, the MRO may be required to prepare for the court a written report setting out his opinion on the financial circumstances of the party and whether he is able to pay maintenance.

2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"   Mr Deputy Speaker, the Family Justice Reform Bill proposes to establish a new Maintenance Enforcement Process (MEP), which kicks in when applicants apply to enforce a maintenance order in the event of non-payment by their former spouse. The new MEP will apply to maintenance orders under the Women's Charter, Guardianship of Infants Act, Administration of Muslim Law Act, Maintenance Orders (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act and the Maintenance of Parents Act. I support the intent of this Bill to improve the enforcement process for maintenance payments. I would like to bring up a few brief points regarding the new process.",1,176,014-002-095-102-021-176,635
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Mr Deputy Speaker, over the years, many divorced spouses have faced various difficulties in getting their former spouses to make their maintenance payments on time or even at all. Many spouses actually even gave up trying to get their payments.",2,177,014-002-095-102-021-177,636
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Under the current system, a common and frustrating experience for many is that former spouses delay or refuse to pay their maintenance for their ex-partners or children and do not pay up until their former partners take up an application in court to enforce maintenance payments. Frequently, for those who can afford to pay, the payment can even be at the doorstep of the court room, just before the hearing. On such an occasion, I understand that the applicant does not even get its legal costs paid despite having to take out such application and engaging a lawyer in the process.",3,178,014-002-095-102-021-178,637
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"And for many who default on their maintenance payments, their former spouses often had to take multiple applications. Many applicants had to take leave from work each time and would even lose income from spending time instructing their lawyers and attending court hearings. Many, I am told, just gave up after a few tries. They just could not afford the time and efforts. Many prefer to spend the time earning more income to make up for their former spouses’ maintenance payments instead of expending time and efforts in applying repeatedly for enforcement.",4,179,014-002-095-102-021-179,638
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister, under the new MEP, how will the new process ensure that such phenomena will not happen or will be minimised? I note that under the new process, if a maintenance order has been complied with, the applicant will have to make an application, albeit online and if the Court were to make a Show-Payment Order requiring proof of payment, specifying an imprisonment term for the respondent’s breach of the Show-Payment Order. Does that mean that the respondent can pay up after such an application is made for a Show-Payment Order or when he receives such an order?",5,180,014-002-095-102-021-180,639
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the new requirement of the MEOs having to distinguish between respondents who cannot afford to pay for maintenance due to their financial situation and those who refuse to pay when they can afford to do so. This is important; it will help to deter and weed out those who game the system by refusing to pay until at least an application for enforcement is made.",6,181,014-002-095-102-021-181,640
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang),"Next, I note that under clause 89, once a maintenance enforcement application has been made, the MEOs have to prepare and submit a report to the court. While the said clause allows the MEO to provide an interim report to any party whom the MEO thinks any information in the MEO’s report ought to be brought to the attention of such a party, the Bill does not seem to require the MEO to provide the full report to the applicant, the respondent or both.",7,182,014-002-095-102-021-182,641

Moreover, it would also be fair to both parties. For example, the applicant should know why the application fails and both parties should know its contents to decide whether it is fair and should be appealed against. If the respondent can afford his maintenance payments, disclosure of such report to the applicant may also deter the respondent from trying to hide his financial status.",8,183,014-002-095-102-021-183,642

I would like to ask the Minister what is the rationale, if any, for not allowing automatic and full disclosure of the MEO’s report to both parties in an application. I would also like to ask what type of information will likely be redacted from this report or excluded from the interim report if the judge decides that such report should be given to either party.",9,184,014-002-095-102-021-184,643

This combines a six-week paid flexible training programme with a transition into a flexible work arrangement (FWA) with good salaries and clear career pathways.

2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"How could gender-neutral maintenance payments be operationalised? This should be done by giving the courts the discretion to order that in appropriate cases, wives should pay maintenance to ex-husbands even if they are not incapacitated.

2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"First, the number of stay-home husbands has been gradually increasing over the years. The Singapore Census Population 2020 showed that the percentage of married households where wives are the sole breadwinners, and I stress married households, increased from 5.8% in 2010 to 7.4% in 2020. That is not an insignificant number at all. In fact, the Labour Force survey for Singapore in 2022 showed that 10.6% of caregivers outside the labour force are males, whether married or unmarried. Again, this is a not an insignificant minority.",8,245,014-002-095-102-021-245,704
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Many stay-at-home husbands, just like stay-at-home wives, have sacrificed their careers and incurred significant opportunity costs to spend years looking after their households and doing unpaid care work such as raising the children. As a result, stay-at-home husbands may have far less savings as compared to their working wives and may well be financially vulnerable in the event of a divorce. Allowing the courts to have discretion to award maintenance to such husbands would serve to recognise their care work and unpaid contributions. It would also help to safeguard the financially vulnerable spouse, whether husband or wife, which is, surely the fundamental purpose of maintenance payments.",9,246,014-002-095-102-021-246,705
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Secondly, since the Women’s Charter was first enacted in 1961, women in Singapore have made significant progress. In 2020, 52.5% of married households were dual-income households, an increase from 47.1% in 2010. In 2022, the employment rate of females aged 15 and over was 60.9%, the fourth highest in comparison with OECD developed countries. With a larger proportion of women in the workforce, it could well be the case that women might out-earn men in some dual-income households and thus, would make economic sense for the husband to take on the bulk of domestic work in a household, depending on the decisions that the husband and wife make in each particular case.",10,247,014-002-095-102-021-247,706
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"However, the current maintenance regime arguably reinforces traditional gendered household roles where men traditionally are regarded as “breadwinners” and women as “homemakers”, by providing that only incapacitated husbands qualify for maintenance. An Institute of Policy Studies survey of stay-at-home fathers in 2020 showed that many of the respondents, many of these stay-at-home dads, experienced “acute stigma” and family members often directed comments suggesting that they were “mooching” from their wives.",11,248,014-002-095-102-021-248,707

2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Thirdly, many other developed countries allow for men to claim maintenance as well, such as the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the USA. And there could be others as well. Let us take a leaf from their books.",13,250,014-002-095-102-021-250,709
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In the UK government’s Guide to Spousal Maintenance, it is stated that “Spousal maintenance is a payment that’s paid by a wife or husband to their former spouse as part of their divorce.” The language used in a similar Australian government public resource is similarly gender-neutral and states  “Under the Family Law Act 1975, a person has a responsibility to financially assist their spouse, or former de facto partner, if that person cannot meet their own reasonable expenses from their personal income or assets.” In section 63 and 64 of New Zealand’s Family Proceedings Act 1980, gender-neutral language is used. For example, “each spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner is liable to maintain the other spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner to the extent that such maintenance is necessary to meet the reasonable needs of the other spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner, where the other spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner cannot practicably meet the whole or any part of those needs because of any one or more of the circumstances specified in subsection (2).” So, the language is gender neutral. To quote from a court verdict in Ontario, Canada by Justice Wildman in Hamdy vs. Hamdy, just to cite another example ""…gender is, of course irrelevant in determining spousal support. What is important are the roles assumed in the marriage.""",14,251,014-002-095-102-021-251,710

I agree with such an aim.",15,252,014-002-095-102-021-252,711
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"However, this does not stop the Government from extending the safeguards provided by the maintenance regime to another potentially vulnerable group, namely stay-at-home husbands.

Firstly, there should be an increase in manpower and resources at the Family Justice Courts. This will ensure that the Courts are adequately equipped to handle cases in a timely and efficient manner. Take the incoming Maintenance Enforcement Officers (MEOs), for example. How many of these MEOs will the Courts be expecting for the Ministry to recruit in order to cope with the high volume of maintenance summons applications? Moreover, it seems to me that the workload and job scope of MEOs are expected to be heavy, having the need to deal with not just the parties involved but also third parties like the Government agencies and financial institutions to obtain information on parties’ financial situations and thereafter, conducting conciliation session with parties and reporting these developments to the court.",10,265,014-002-095-102-021-265,724

2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),There are two parts of this Bill which I wish to speak on.,2,277,014-002-095-102-021-277,736
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Clause 81 – Court Orders on Maintenance enforcement application. Currently, when a Complainant applies to court for enforcement of maintenance, the frustration is always with the possible delays in the receipt of the maintenance.",3,278,014-002-095-102-021-278,737
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Delays happen when the respondent does not turn up; the case is then adjourned. The next time the respondent turns up, he applies for adjournment to engage a lawyer. The case is then adjourned again.",4,279,014-002-095-102-021-279,738
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Sometimes, the court sends parties for mediation and the case is adjourned again while parties try to find an amicable solution. If the respondent disputes the claim, the Court will direct parties to prepare their case and more time is taken up.",5,280,014-002-095-102-021-280,739
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"In the meantime, the complainant suffers because of the time required to attend court again and again and the failure to receive the maintenance which had been ordered to be paid to the applicant.",6,281,014-002-095-102-021-281,740
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Even if the respondent were to eventually make payment of the arrears of maintenance, there is this possibility that he may default in payment again, then the applicant has to start the process all over again.",7,282,014-002-095-102-021-282,741
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Thus, there will be times when an applicant may eventually give up on the maintenance application and decide not to enforce the Order. This is unfair to an applicant who has been granted the maintenance.",8,283,014-002-095-102-021-283,742
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Hence, Sir, I support the amendments to the Women’s Charter to allow the appointment of the Maintenance Enforcement Officers (MEO) in order to have a more sustainable maintenance outcome. The MEOs would then be empowered to carry out investigations on the assets of the respondent and then report to the judge. Without the information given by the MEOs, the applicant who is trying to enforce the maintenance order will have a difficult time trying to check what are the respondent's assets.",9,284,014-002-095-102-021-284,743
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"In particular, the courts should be given the powers to act expeditiously and to make interim orders, whenever necessary, to ensure that complainants or applicants who are financially stretched are able to receive the maintenance that they deserve and are entitled to receive; otherwise, the applicant would typically suffer and situations where their children involved will result in hardship for the family.",10,285,014-002-095-102-021-285,744
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Where the MEOs are able to ascertain that the respondent is deliberately refusing to make the maintenance payment, the court should not hesitate to attach the salary of the respondent or attach his assets in order to enforce the maintenance order. In addition, the court should consider making an order that the respondent's credit cards be cancelled until the arrears of maintenance are settled.",11,286,014-002-095-102-021-286,745
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Where a MEO finds that a respondent’s conduct in refusing to pay the maintenance is contumacious, I would submit that the court ought to punish the respondent for wasting the time of the applicant and the time of the MEO and wasting the time of the courts. The respondent should not be able to get away with delaying the maintenance payment just to frustrate the applicant; and then he walks away without consequence once he pays up the arrears.",12,287,014-002-095-102-021-287,746
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Sir, I recognise that there may be occasions where a respondent may be unable to make payment of the maintenance because his family circumstances have changed. For example, if he loses his job or sometimes, if the respondent remarries and has to support another family. In situations like this, I expect that the MEO would recommend a variation of the maintenance order.",13,288,014-002-095-102-021-288,747
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),May I then ask the Minister how would the court make a reasonable variation order which can take into account the needs of an applicant who is reliant on the respondent’s maintenance for herself and the children versus the financial needs of the respondent who now has to support another wife and possibly his other children.,14,289,014-002-095-102-021-289,748
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),May I also ask whether the MEO is able to investigate and deal with cases where a respondent resigns from his job and has no more income as he simply wishes to deny maintenance payable to the applicant. The loss of income in this case is or would be self-induced with the intent of denying the applicant the maintenance which she ought to be entitled to.,15,290,014-002-095-102-021-290,749
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),How would the court also deal with situations where a respondent refuses to pay child maintenance because he is denied access or visitation rights to the child? Will the court be able to deal with such situations even though the application before the Court is an enforcement of maintenance application. Or would the court require a separate application for enforcement of the access rights?,16,291,014-002-095-102-021-291,750
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Sir, the next part of the Bill which I wish to speak on is the enhancement of judge-led approach in considering wishes of the child.",17,292,014-002-095-102-021-292,751
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Sir, in the media release by MinLaw, it was stated that the Bill will provide clarity that where the wishes of the child are to be considered by the Court, the judge may conduct interviews with the child.",18,293,014-002-095-102-021-293,752
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"The current legal position is that the Court in making decisions about the child may appoint a Child Representative to the court or the court can appoint a trained or professional assessor to make recommendations on the child’s custody or access orders. The appointed assessor would then prepare a Social Welfare Report, or a Custody Evaluation Report or an Access Evaluation Report.",19,294,014-002-095-102-021-294,753
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),The judge may also ascertain the wishes of the child by conducting an interview with the child and there has been case laws on the power of the judge to do so.,20,295,014-002-095-102-021-295,754
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"However, may I express some reservations about a judge carrying out interviews of the child because a judge is typically an authority in the law. He or she is not a trained child counsellor who can discern whether a child has been coached to express certain views or is under duress to say positive things about one parent just by one interview. Although some judges may have some degree of training in handling children, the reality is that a judge spends more time analysing the law and the facts applicable to the case.",21,296,014-002-095-102-021-296,755
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"Thus, unless a judge spends a much, much longer period of time talking and interviewing the child, I do have some reservations whether a judge is able to make a better assessment of the wishes of a child by a simple interview as compared to trained social workers who will be spending more time talking and interacting with the child and observing the expressions of the child.",22,297,014-002-095-102-021-297,756
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"So, may I ask the Minister to clarify what is the intent of this amendment as the current case law does allow the process. Is it the position of the Government that they prefer that judges carry out the interviews more regularly as compared to the judge appointing social workers or Child Representative to take care of the child’s interest? At the end of the day, what is important is how to ascertain what is in the best interest of the child. Subject to the above clarifications, Sir, I support the Bill.",23,298,014-002-095-102-021-298,757

2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),It is certainly helpful to have a new unit of Maintenance Enforcement Officers (MEOs) set up and given the power to obtain information about the parties' assets and means from entities including banks and Government agencies such as the Central Provident Fund Board (CPF) and Housing Board & Development Board (HDB) to ensure that those who refuse to pay are dealt with more decisively.,2,301,014-002-095-102-021-301,760
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"The officers are part of a new Maintenance Enforcement Process (MEP), which will simplify applications related to non-payment of maintenance orders.",3,302,014-002-095-102-021-302,761
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"While the MEOs could help distinguish between those who cannot afford to pay maintenance and those who have the financial means but refuse to pay, the officers may face challenges if the parties who could have the ability and capability to derive a better income have indeed tried his best to do so and chose not to do so to benefit the applicant.",4,303,014-002-095-102-021-303,762
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"In addition, the officers would still need to work on the acceptance of medical certification from medical practitioners to determine if the respondent's medical conditions are reasonable to justify for the lower maintenance payments or exclusion of possible imprisonment order for failure to show proof of payment. Will the officers require the respondent to seek confirmation from only selected medical officers.",5,304,014-002-095-102-021-304,763
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"In the case of a bankrupt respondent, will the award and repayment of maintenance payments be prioritised against other creditors?",6,305,014-002-095-102-021-305,764
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"How would the MEO or Court prioritise if the respondent who is the only sole breadwinner and also child who needs to support parents and his income is insufficient to support all, especially the parents are sick.",7,306,014-002-095-102-021-306,765
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"I am supportive of the introduction of ""rebuttable presumption"" to address the issue of respondents dissipating assets, such as by spending money or moving it to another account.",8,307,014-002-095-102-021-307,766
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"With the presumption, the onus is then on the respondent to show that there was no intention to siphon out assets. The applicant must show that this happened less than three years before he or she applied for a clawback order, or that there is an impending move that would frustrate enforcement of the maintenance order. Evidence found by the MEO can be used.",9,308,014-002-095-102-021-308,767

2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"The presiding judge in divorce cases will have greater controls, including setting restrictions on the cross-examination process in Court to prevent family relations from further disintegrating. Because both parties would try to reveal each other’s faults, the judge would have the power to issue Court orders to protect the interest of the family as well as the children.",13,312,014-002-095-102-021-312,771
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio),"For example, if the judge believes that the cross-examination could bring undue stress upon the vulnerable witness, he can set out restrictions on the cross-examination process.

I have three points to make.",1,322,014-002-095-102-021-322,781
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My first point is on the enhanced maintenance enforcement process (MEP), which simplifies the enforcement of maintenance orders.",2,323,014-002-095-102-021-323,782
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"First, the new section 86 allows the Maintenance Enforcement Officer (MEO) to seek Court orders for banks or prescribed third parties to provide information. Can the Minister share who these prescribed third parties may be?",3,324,014-002-095-102-021-324,783
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Second, can the Minister share what are the contemplated timelines that the MEO will seek from the Court for banks and prescribed third parties? Family lawyers have shared with me that banks take time to respond to their requests for information. Can the Minister share if the banks have been consulted on their ability to respond within the contemplated timelines?",4,325,014-002-095-102-021-325,784
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Third, the new section 88 allows an MEO to conduct conciliation sessions to help both parties agree on maintenance. Given that conciliation sessions could be used by a party to delay proceedings, can the Minister share whether there is a limit on the number of conciliation sessions that the MEO can conduct? Can the Minister share what are the consequences for a party if they fail to attend or are clearly not participating in good faith on the conciliation?",5,326,014-002-095-102-021-326,785
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Fourth, MEOs will be empowered to obtain information from parties and to submit a report to the Court. Can the Minister share what training will be provided to the MEOs to make discovery of the relevant documents and assess the parties’ actual financial positions? Can the Minister elaborate on what the MEO’s report is supposed to set out and whether it will be provided to both parties? Can the Minister also share whether there will be a standard rubric for MEOs to assess parties’ financial positions in preparing the report?",6,327,014-002-095-102-021-327,786
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Fifth, the Court may vary the original maintenance orders in the MEP. Applicants may think twice before applying under the MEP if their application may lead to their original maintenance orders being varied. Can the Minister clarify if it is only under exceptional circumstances that the Court will vary the original maintenance orders in the MEP? If so, can the Minister share what factors a Court should take into account before varying the original maintenance orders in the MEP?",7,328,014-002-095-102-021-328,787
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My second point is on the attachment of earnings Court orders. These Court orders direct a party’s employer to deduct a portion of maintenance from their salary to make direct payment to the other party. The new section 91H allows the Court to determine what payments to a person are earnings that can be directed for the payment of maintenance. The relevant sections set out obligations relating to the respondent’s employer and employment when an attachment of earnings order is made. Can the Minister clarify whether earnings from freelance or gig economy work can be deemed earnings? If such earnings can be subject to an attachment of earnings order, can the Minister clarify how the obligations relating to traditional employers or employment apply where the respondent is engaged in gig work?",8,329,014-002-095-102-021-329,788
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My third point is on financial counselling for couples undergoing divorce. In the public consultation for the RERF Committee’s recommendations, members of the public asked to build up capabilities in financial counselling to help divorcees better manage their new finances. The new section 91(b) makes progress in this area. It provides the Court with powers to order a party to undergo financial counselling as part of maintenance enforcement proceedings.",9,330,014-002-095-102-021-330,789

2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Also, given that parents with children under 21 years old must undergo the Mandatory Co-Parenting Programme (CPP) before filing for divorce, can Minister of State Sun Xueling share if there are plans to incorporate mandatory financial counselling and planning as part of the CPP?",12,333,014-002-095-102-021-333,792

2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"A suggestion is for MinLaw and MSF to consider empowering Social Service Office (SSO) or social workers with the role to act on behalf of such applicants, in their navigation of the online application and appropriate referral to the Family Justice Court if they are found to require additional attention to expedite enforcement of their maintenance, especially where the welfare of young children is at stake.",6,354,014-002-095-102-021-354,813
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Secondly, I would like to raise another consideration with the enforcement of maintenance. In the Bill, amendments are proposed to the Women's Charter in section 71 to empower the Court to make attachment of earning order for maintenance to secure payment of any maintenance from the respondent. Additionally, the Bill added a new section 81 to the Women's Charter to provide directions to the Court on the orders that it may or must make on a maintenance enforcement application, which included a Show-Payment Order and when breached, the respondent is liable for imprisonment.",7,355,014-002-095-102-021-355,814

In such instances, I would like to ask what powers and directions the Court are vested with to ensure that the maintenance order would be fully enforced within a reasonable stipulated time, for the respondents to be brought to task expediently to reduce hardship on the applicants needing the maintenance.",8,356,014-002-095-102-021-356,815

Mdm Goh started applying for enforcement but has been stuck for a while as the court informed her that her former husband has an outstanding warrant of arrest, which renders the enforcement of maintenance not possible until his arrest.

While she understands that ComCare assistance is provided only for short to mid-term and she needs to get a job, she has only been able to convince employers to let her work on daily hours-rated jobs because of her need to rush home to care for her young children before and after school or childcare hours, alone. She also has to wrestle with her bankruptcy status due to her former husband using her name against her will for a loan on which he defaulted.

Thankful to SSO's help to my appeal, she is given some ComCare extension while I assist her in finding jobs nearer to her home. Given her unresolved maintenance payments from her former husband, which may never be paid, she may be a genuine single parent who will require ComCare assistance to be maintained at a level for a few more years until her younger two children also enter primary school and when she can hopefully find a full-time job with her ITE qualification.",12,360,014-002-095-102-021-360,819

Therefore, it is extremely important to simplify and strengthen our family justice process. I strongly support the Family Justice Reform Bill jointly drafted by MinLaw and MSF. This will allow marriages to end in a harmonious manner and safeguard the welfare of the children through a therapeutic justice system.

2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"First, the family justice process set out in the Bill requires divorcees to apply for maintenance online. I am worried that online applications will deter divorcees who are not tech-savvy and will indirectly affect them and their children's welfare. I hope MinLaw and MSF will work together to identify vulnerable groups who need help, such as low-income divorcees who are single parents, and provide more social assistance to help them claim maintenance effectively. I also hope that MinLaw and MSF can authorise social workers to apply to the Court for alimony on behalf of the divorcee when necessary, such as when the welfare of the children is seriously affected.",15,363,014-002-095-102-021-363,822
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio),"Second, I would like to relate the story of my resident, Mdm Goh. In the process of claiming maintenance, the Court issued a warrant of arrest but Mdm Goh's ex-husband was not contactable, hence the alimony could not be claimed. Mdm Goh had to raise three children on her own and struggled financially because she could not get any maintenance. Her story illustrated the importance of therapeutic justice. I hope that MinLaw and MSF will provide more social assistance in cases, such as Mdm Goh's, and to help them claim maintenance.",16,364,014-002-095-102-021-364,823

This is even more so if the couples have young children. Hence, let me conclude my speech by affirming the efforts of MinLaw and MSF in their determination to reform and strengthen Therapeutic Justice elements in the family justice system. Additionally, I also hope that this Bill will help vulnerable individuals, especially those that may have been through an abusive marriage, to regain themselves swiftly and rebuild their lives.

Unfortunately, she was in an abusive relationship, suffering under the hands of an abusive husband she once loved. She was a housewife with no other sources of income and wholly dependent on the sole breadwinner. She endured the strain of the relationship and the pain of the abuse and held on because of her young children. She would have had a fifth child if not for a miscarriage that she suffered after a beating so bad that she was hospitalised for a week.

Typically, as in the story I shared earlier, the victim would have had to endure many years of unpaid maintenance through protracted proceedings. So, not everyone would make a claim immediately upon breach.",15,381,014-002-095-102-021-381,840
2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-021,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Fourthly, in some cases, there are other competing creditors. The usual refrain from the ex-spouse is that he or she had to pay off other loans or financial commitments first. The financial strain on the paying party is real. We need to balance their interests, too. This is especially in cases where the respondent has been declared bankrupt. In most cases, the applicant is unlikely to be able to recover any monies from an insolvent respondent.

When a marriage ends, the couple should separate amicably, because even though they are no longer a family, the family ties and the love between the parents and their children should never cease to exist. I hope with this new process, we can ensure that the child's maintenance can be provisioned as soon as possible and the responsibility of providing maintenance as a parent can be carried out.",20,386,014-002-095-102-021-386,845

2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-023,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,"Mr Zhulkarnain also asked about past outstanding maintenance and limitation periods. The Bill does not change the existing position on limitation. Generally, an applicant needs to commence proceedings to enforce arrears within three years from the time that such arrears are due. The applicant will then be able to include those arrears in future enforcement applications if the arrears remain unpaid.

The new MEOs will gather evidence and carry out conciliation to help parties reach a sustainable solution. However, if parties do not settle, the Court will still make a final decision, possibly using information and evidence gathered by the MEO. It is, therefore, preferable for the MEOs’ evidence gathering and conciliation roles to be independent of the Court. We have discussed this with the Judiciary, which supported the proposal for the MEOs to be sited within the Executive. AGC’s advice was also sought on the matter.",6,8,014-002-095-102-023-008,861

Mr Pillai also requested for clarification on the ambit of a “third party” under the Bill and whether a third party may be asked to disclose information relating to proxies. The third party may be any person who has relevant information. Thus, if an MEO, in the course of fact-finding, has reason to suspect that the respondent has assets that are held in the name of proxies, the MEO may seek a Court order for a third party to disclose information about the assets.

The Court may also proceed with the hearing of the application. If the respondent is absent for the hearing of the application, the new Family Justice Rules will allow the Court to proceed to make the appropriate orders, if certain conditions are satisfied.

Financial assistance is not intended to replace the parties’ financial responsibilities to their families, but acts as a safety net for our fellow Singaporeans in need. The matter will, therefore, still proceed for conciliation and hearing after the MEO makes the referral to financial assistance. The MEO will take into account the financial assistance granted, if any, as part of the overall assessment of the financial circumstances of the parties.

The MEO has broad powers to gather information for the Court from third parties, including information that is ordinarily private and confidential. The MEO reports this to the Court.

For example, the Court may imprison a respondent who has no good reason for failing to pay maintenance on time, even if that respondent pays up after the applicant files the enforcement application.",45,47,014-002-095-102-023-047,900

An imprisonment term may also be specified for the breach of the Show-Payment Order.",46,48,014-002-095-102-023-048,901

Being denied access is not grounds for non-compliance with a maintenance order. A parent has a legal duty to maintain a child, whether the child is in his or her custody or not. If the respondent is denied access to the child, he or she may take up an application for the enforcement of the access order.",47,49,014-002-095-102-023-049,902

2023-05-08,Family Justice Reform Bill,014-002-095-102-023,Ms Rahayu Mahzam,Mr Zhulkarnain suggested that all maintenance orders be placed on a searchable database registry and that a recalcitrant defaulter can be placed on a blacklist with an alert to the Credit Service Bureau. The Women's Charter already provides for an Applicant who has filed for maintenance enforcement to be able to lodge a report to a designated credit bureau regarding unpaid arrears stated on the order of Court. Applicants will continue to be able to lodge such reports under the new MEP.,49,51,014-002-095-102-023-051,904

Mr Zhulkarnain has asked for clarification on how the new MEP and the bankruptcy regime will interface with one another. As Mr Zhulkarnain has correctly mentioned, the reforms in this Bill do not change the order of priorities of an insolvent debtor. The reforms also do not change how enforcement proceedings or orders ordinarily interact with the bankruptcy regime.",51,53,014-002-095-102-023-053,906

They are individuals who allow criminals to control their bank or other payment accounts. They also include those who use their accounts to receive or transfer monies under the criminals' instructions. Some of the Members may recall the OCBC phishing scam that occurred between December 2021 and January 2022 – 790 victims fell prey. The total losses amounted to $13.7 million.

2023-05-08,"Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) (Amendment) Bill",014-002-095-102-024,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Why do the scammers need money mules? Scam syndicates typically cultivate a network of money mules to facilitate their crimes or to launder criminal proceeds. The money mules' bank accounts form a web of multiple accounts; scammed monies can be split into different denominations and transferred through these accounts. This process is repeated many times over, so that the monies go through multiple layers of bank accounts, before being transferred out of Singapore, into the hands of the syndicate. This tactic of ""layering"" is designed to make it difficult for the authorities to follow the money trail and to get to the perpetrators.",11,19,014-002-095-102-024-019,995

They claimed not to have known the identity of the person who instructed them, nor the identity of the bank account holders whom they were receiving funds from or transferring funds to. Many agreed to facilitate these money transfers because they were paid to do so.

Irresponsible Singpass users have facilitated this by selling or sharing their Singpass credentials, such as their Singpass password and SMS one-time password. Scam syndicates effectively assume the identity of a Singpass user for their criminal activities and exploit the Singpass account to commit criminal activities while hiding their own tracks.

This includes recognising the limitations of current laws, which make it difficult to take the money mules to task. It requires the Prosecution to prove that the money mule had knowledge or reasonable grounds to believe that the monies transacted through his bank account are linked to criminal activity. As a result of these difficulties, of the 19,000 money mules investigated by Police from 2020 to 2022, fewer than 250 money mules were eventually prosecuted.

Not only have these victims lost significant amounts of hard-earned monies or retirement savings, they also lived with the mental anguish and guilt of being gullible enough to fall for such deception. Often, the victims were vulnerable in certain ways and susceptible to exploitation, such as those who live alone and are desperate for friends to chat with, or those searching for a life partner, who then becomes the victim of a love scam.",1,88,014-002-095-102-024-088,1064

Due to the organised nature of scams, which are often transnational, Police have the unenviable task of informing victims that their chances of recovering their monies are often slim.

These are likely to cover current topics which have the most public interest. This is not new, and is done in other Westminster Parliaments such as the UK and Canada. For example, in the UK, the Leader of the Opposition has 17 days where he can select the topics for debate. These debates cover a wide range of issues, from government policy to current events. This also provides a platform for the Opposition to hold the Government to account, challenge its policies and decisions and propose alternative policies or solutions to issues facing the country.",22,25,014-002-095-102-026-025,1122

The PPC plays an important role in providing a platform for citizens to voice their concerns and grievances to the Government. It is, therefore, crucial that the PPC is seen as objective and non-partisan, and having an Opposition Member as a chairperson can help to ensure this. In the UK, there is no rule that the Petitions Committee must be chaired by an Opposition Member, but this is currently the case.",27,30,014-002-095-102-026-030,1127

Ultimately, it is the Ministers who decide on the Government's agenda and set the major direction of policies being implemented. These policies are not presented by the civil service fully-formed, with all the Ministers having to do is simply read out the policy speech in Parliament. Ministers provide political guidance to the civil service to deliver results and the Ministers have to take responsibility for the same.

And the Parliament which elected him was, in turn, elected by the people, who also decided the proportion of PAP MPs and Opposition MPs.

FIs have to assess a person’s fitness and propriety holistically, in considering if the person is fit for the role. MAS has allowed persons with past records of dishonesty to enter the financial industry, having considered the seriousness and circumstances of the person’s past record, the time that has elapsed since the offence, the responsibilities to be assumed, and the controls put in place by the FI to monitor the person’s conduct.

Should the halal stall operator cease operation, the coffee shop operator is required to find a replacement within the current tenancy period. It is in the interest of the operator to find a replacement as soon as possible, to minimise loss of revenue arising from the vacant stall.",1,2,014-002-095-102-102-002,1486

The Ministry of National Development and HDB are concerned about residents’ needs and have also been listening to the feedback of coffee shop operators. Some have found it difficult to secure replacement stalls due to lower demand in certain areas or strong competition from other options nearby.",3,4,014-002-095-102-102-004,1488

2023-05-08,Timelines for Public Consultation on Enhanced Community Disputes Management Framework,014-002-095-102-106,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"  The Community Dispute Management Framework (CDMF) promotes neighbourliness and encourages residents to engage with one another in the first instance when disputes arise. As much as possible, it is best that disputes are resolved amicably at an early stage, before they become intransigent or intractable. Residents can also seek help from grassroot leaders to facilitate communications or attempt formal mediation at the Community Mediation Centre with a trained mediator.",1,3,014-002-095-102-106-003,1501

These are often complex and subjective issues for which the setting of clearer social norms plays a pivotal role. The Community Advisory Panel on Neighbourhood Noise (CAP) has established a set of community norms to manage noise and foster harmonious living, including an understanding of what kinds of noise are acceptable or unacceptable in the residential setting. Since receiving the CAP’s recommendations, the Municipal Services Office (MSO) has been working with partners to promote the proposed community norms and engaging relevant stakeholders on the proposed recommendations.",3,5,014-002-095-102-106-005,1503

We will also consider the extent to which any other enhancements to the framework can eventually also benefit residents in private estates, with adjustments as may be appropriate. We should add that CDMF should not take away from the community’s capacity to resolve disputes. Hence, the new pilot unit leveraging stronger laws will focus mainly on intervening in serious disputes. What qualifies as serious will be considered on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the context and circumstances in which the dispute has arisen.",4,6,014-002-095-102-106-006,1504

2023-05-08,Plans to Mitigate Effects of Shortage Occupation List on Reliance on Foreign Labour,014-002-095-102-108,Dr Tan See Leng,"  The Shortage Occupation List (SOL) is designed to complement efforts to develop the pipeline of local professionals. Enabling companies to access foreign professionals for shortage occupations allows these companies to grow their business and create new opportunities. Part of the criteria before an occupation is placed on the SOL is not just whether there is a shortage of such local workers, but also what plans there are by the industry and companies to train and place locals into these jobs.",1,2,014-002-095-102-108-002,1510

However, based on MOM’s ad hoc interviews with migrant workers conducted in 2019, they typically incur S$2,000 to S$10,000 in fees to work in Singapore. This depends on factors, such as the economic conditions and the extent of intermediary involvement in the recruitment process in their home countries.",1,2,014-002-095-102-109-002,1514

LFPR for women aged 25 to 64 has increased from 74.8% in 2018 to 78.6% in 2021, which is higher than countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom.

FWAs help caregivers better balance work and caregiving responsibilities. We have seen good progress in the provision of FWAs by employers; the proportion of employers offering at least one formal FWA has significantly increased from 53% in 2018 to 91% in 2021. The tripartite partners will give this a further push, by introducing a set of Tripartite Guidelines on FWAs by 2024. The guidelines aim to make requesting for FWAs a workplace norm, by requiring employers to put in place proper processes to fairly consider and respond to employees’ requests for FWAs. We will also continue to support employers with training and tools to implement FWAs effectively and sustainably. We are heartened that some employers, HR professionals and employees have already come together to co-create FWA tools, through the Alliance for Action on Work-Life Harmony.",2,3,014-002-095-102-110-003,1518

They can tap on the full range of programmes and services offered by Workforce Singapore (WSG). Over the last three years, WSG and the National Trades Union Congress' Employment and Employability Institute (NTUC’s e2i) have placed more than 83,000 women jobseekers across its programmes and services. This represents around 47% of all jobseekers placed by WSG and NTUC’s e2i, similar to the share of women in the labour force. In June 2022, WSG launched the herCareer initiative, a new, focused effort to support women who are re-entering the workforce.

Since 2012, we have more than doubled full-day preschool capacity to over 200,000 places today. We enhanced means-tested preschool subsidies so that more families pay less for preschool. Working mothers are also granted additional tax relief.
