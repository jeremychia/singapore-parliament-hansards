To support companies in their internationalisation efforts, IE Singapore provides assistance through the Market Readiness Assistance (MRA), and the Global Company Partnership (GCP) schemes. The MRA provides broad-based assistance to companies that are starting to internationalise, while the GCP provides targeted assistance to companies with more established overseas presence, in capability and manpower development, market access, and financing. Through the MRA and GCP schemes, IE Singapore supported over 3,500 internationalisation projects for SMEs since 2014, 30% of which were to help companies penetrate new overseas markets and grow their businesses.",1,2,013-001-094-046-001-002,2

Since 2014, iMAP supported a total of 80 business missions that benefited 1,190 companies, majority of which were SMEs.

2017-05-08,SMEs Venturing to Overseas Markets,013-001-094-046-001,Ms Sim Ann,"  Madam, we are constantly looking for ways to broaden our outreach to SMEs so that they are aware of the range of assistance that is available. In fact, internationalisation is a very key strategy that has also been elaborated upon in the Committee on the Future Economy. We are doing so, first, directly, through IE Singapore's own publicity efforts. We also do a lot of this publicity through Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) because they also help spread the word. We do so also for informal groupings. For instance, the one that comes to mind is ""The Bosses Network"". They hold an annual learning cruise. I will be attending this event in order to help SMEs understand the full range of assistance and support, schemes that are available, not limited to internationalisation, but that is obviously going to be a key one.",1,7,013-001-094-046-001-007,7
2017-05-08,SMEs Venturing to Overseas Markets,013-001-094-046-001,Ms Sim Ann,"As for helping our SMEs take part in G-to-G projects, I suppose Er Dr Lee Bee Wah is thinking perhaps of, for instance, a G-to-G project between Singapore and China. The entire purpose of setting up G-to-G projects really is to help expand the scope of economic and trade collaboration. We hope very much that our SMEs, too, benefit. For instance, some of it may be in terms of creating a space where business can flourish. The first G-to-G project between Singapore and China, the Suzhou Industrial Park, is of this nature. Likewise, the Tianjin Eco-city. For the third G-to-G project, the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative, the scope has broadened because it is not just about township development or industrial park development. It is also about, for instance, logistics development, ICT and financing exchanges. This opens up the scope for even more companies, large and small, in different sectors to participate.",2,8,013-001-094-046-001-008,8

The challenge, very often, I think, is in reaching out to SMEs and encouraging them, for instance, to attend talks and forums organised by IE Singapore or in coming along on business missions.",3,9,013-001-094-046-001-009,9

We have been monitoring the situation and taking steps to address the concerns. The Health Promotion Board (HPB) and international organisations including the World Health Organization (WHO), strongly encourage breastfeeding as it can provide the nutritional needs of infants, with the added benefits of promoting mother-child bonding. Breast milk is the best milk to meet the nutritional needs of infants. HPB recommends that, where possible, mothers should exclusively breastfeed their babies for the first six months. Between six and 12 months, babies should be given breast milk along with complementary foods. For children above 12 months of age, cows' milk, as part of a balanced diet, is adequate to meet their nutritional needs. Formula milk is not required for children beyond the first year of age.",2,3,013-001-094-046-002-003,12

The scientific evidence for this is weak.

They will provide infant formula when needed, for example, if the mother is unable to produce enough milk to meet the baby's needs or for specific medical reason for which the mother should be discouraged from breastfeeding.

All public hospitals offering maternity services are already BFHI-certified today, but private hospitals have yet to come on board. And this is unsatisfactory. BFHI-certified hospitals are committed to actively encourage and support breastfeeding targets, and are not allowed to enter into sponsorship arrangements with milk powder companies, given the potential for conflicts of interest.

Besides doing all these, at the same time, we should also improve consumer protection. The Government will strengthen restrictions on advertising and labelling. The Sale of Infant Food Ethics Committee, Singapore (SIFECS) Code of Ethics already restricts advertising, marketing and promotion of infant formula for infants below six months in Singapore. Nevertheless, HPB is supporting an on-going review of the SIFECS Code which will include extending its coverage to all infant formula for infants up to 12 months of age. The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) will tighten its regulations on labelling and advertising further, including prohibiting the use of nutrition and health claims, and idealised images for infant formula milk. This will also discourage companies from incurring massive costs on aggressive advertising and marketing activities, and passing these costs on to consumers. Taken together, the increased choices available, and improved clarity of labelling should enhance the competitiveness of the infant formula market.",14,15,013-001-094-046-002-015,24

MTI and other Government agencies such as MOH, HPB, and AVA will take steps to increase consumer awareness, encourage good practices in hospitals, facilitate more formula milk options and further tighten regulations on labelling and advertising.

2017-05-08,Fair Pricing for Milk Powder,013-001-094-046-002,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"  Madam, I thank the Member for her clarification questions. In terms of setting a price for special formulas, children who have specific needs for which normal milk formula cannot fulfil, for example, specific allergies or medical conditions, will therefore require more expensive formula feeds because of the special formulation required. It will be quite difficult for us to restrict a particular formula for its price, because there is definitely an R&D expenditure that the company has to incur. What we can do is to make sure that we increase the choices that are available, and where necessary, put in the necessary financial support to these families to defray the cost of such formula that they require. But hopefully, these are a more restricted group of infants.",1,20,013-001-094-046-002-020,29

2017-05-08,Fair Pricing for Milk Powder,013-001-094-046-002,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"There is also a big range of milk formula pricing on the shelves today. Some can go for about $20-plus to $30 for a 900 g tin, and others can go up to about $60. So, within this range, parents do have a choice. And I think this is where education of the parents to allay their anxiety that they are not shortchanging their children by giving them the cheaper option, because the cheaper option, nutritionally, is just as good as the more expensive one. And I think this is where we can introduce the much more robust and healthier competition within the market by removing the information asymmetry.",3,22,013-001-094-046-002-022,31

2017-05-08,Fair Pricing for Milk Powder,013-001-094-046-002,Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong),"Firstly, does the current Consumer Price Index (CPI) include infant milk formula in the basket of goods to assess cost of living? As background, I note the recent CPI report mentioned milk, cheese and eggs under food, but not specifically infant formula. Secondly, will MTI consider studying a cost of living index, specifically for parents with young children, so that the Government can understand better, to how to support young families, especially families starting with less?",2,26,013-001-094-046-002-026,35

But let us also understand that expenditure is very much influenced by consumer choices and consumer behaviour. And therefore, this is where I go back to the point about educating our parents to understand that expensive does not mean it is better; cheaper does not mean it is worse. There should be no guilt on the parents' part about buying the cheaper brand of milk. As long as your child can get used to the milk, or they are not suffering from any allergic reaction to that particular brand of milk, there is no real reason to really pay out more when there is something that is just as good and much cheaper. This is where education needs to play a role to help households rationalise their expenditure.",3,29,013-001-094-046-002-029,38

For example, most of us would have ComCare funds we can use or even Community Development and Welfare Fund (CDWF) that we can also mobilise for short-term support, while the hospital tries to sort out how they can help these specific children with needs. Pre-term infants who require special formulas are a different category altogether, but fortunately, they are not the bulk of the kind of infants that we have to take care of.

Even with a reduced cohort pathways and merging of JCs, JC eligibility criteria remain the same, at 20 points. At or below 20 points, you are eligible to enter JC. The pathway of JC remains intact. I think we need to understand that when cohort sizes fall, it is relentless. It affects everyone.

2017-05-08,Impact of Recent Price Increases on Cost of Living,013-001-094-046-015,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"On the question about whether the 0.2 percentage-point increase includes some of the rebates and Government subsidies, the answer is  no. Let me just explain this − there are a few ways we can help to offset some of these. One, of course, is to stagger the price increases, and as Members would remember, the water tariffs are increased over two tranches  the first tranche will be in July this year, and the next increment will be in July next year. It is broken up into two phases to offset the steepness of the increase.",2,12,013-001-094-046-015-012,161
2017-05-08,Impact of Recent Price Increases on Cost of Living,013-001-094-046-015,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"The U-Save rebates are not taken into account in the CPI calculations, as these are actually given to households as a lump sum to be utilised over a few months. The rebates are treated as some form of income transfer. They do not directly reduce the price of the individual product per se, such as the water tariff, for example. And therefore, they do not get calculated as part of the CPI adjustments. Therefore, I think when you look at the top-line adjustments for CPI, bear in mind that hidden behind it, there are also some form of U-Save rebates, for example, that are not captured in the adjustment. So, for households that receive rebates, the impact for them will be much less than what is reported.",3,13,013-001-094-046-015-013,162

Common hygiene-related infringements include failing to register food-handlers, selling food that is unclean and failing to keep the premises clean or free of pest infestation. Licensees are liable for a maximum fine of $2,000 upon conviction of such offences. They are also awarded demerit points for each offence committed and upon accumulating 12 demerit points within a 12-month period, their licences will be suspended for two weeks as an additional penalty.

About a third of the enforcement actions were taken against stalls in food courts, coffee-shops or canteens. Correspondingly, the number of licences that were suspended increased from 62 in 2013 to 132 in 2016. Of the 132 licences suspended in 2016, 60 involved stalls in food courts, coffee-shops and canteens, up from 14 in 2013. Meanwhile, the food poisoning incidence rate at food retail establishments had remained low, being consistently maintained at 3.2 food poisoning outbreaks per 1,000 food retail establishments or below, since 2013. This means that 0.32% or less of the food retail establishments were implicated in food poisoning outbreaks each year. This suggests that the systems put in place were effective deterrents against poor food hygiene practices.

Given the nature of the F&B industry, with high turnover, and a large number of part-time or temporary workers, I think it will be a challenge to require all workers to do this, not to add that there will be impact on business cost. And in fact, mandating that all their food handlers must be trained under BFHC and registered before they can start work is already raised as a pain point by the F&B industry although we need to ensure that this is complied with.

Such measures include Supply Bills and resolutions on certain guarantees and loans. The recommendation is for the Clerk to publish a notice in the Hansard and the Gazette if the President does not signify his decision on such measures within the prescribed time limit. Under the Constitution, if the President fails to make a decision within the prescribed time limit, he is deemed to have agreed with the proposed measure.",6,6,013-001-094-046-021-006,214

The Committee has recommended that procedural machinery be put in place for this purpose. The procedures will provide that (a) the President's grounds and the CPA's recommendation must be made available two clear days before a Motion to overrule the President can be moved; (b) the Speaker must be satisfied that the President's veto was in fact contrary to the CPA's recommendation, as required by the Constitution; and (c) there is to be a standard form of words for Motions to overrule the President.",7,7,013-001-094-046-021-007,215

In effect, this means at least two weeks must pass between the First and Second Reading of a Bill. The increased interval would avoid situations where Bills come up for Second Reading too quickly because the House is sitting for an extended period, for example, during the Budget debates. In practice, the interval between First and Second Readings would generally be longer − Bills introduced are generally debated only at the next month's sitting.",10,10,013-001-094-046-021-010,218

The heads of expenditure in a Supply Bill would have been fully debated by the House during the Committee of Supply (COS) proceedings, and it makes more sense for the House to go to the Second Reading immediately after COS proceedings are completed, instead of diverting to some other business, or adjourning the sitting and coming back to the Supply Bill later.",11,11,013-001-094-046-021-011,219

The correction would be made by a written statement circulated to Members and published in the Hansard. The Speaker's leave must be sought within 72 hours after the draft Hansard is circulated.

On this specific suggestion, the Committee did not think it was necessary.

At other times, I recognise we were not able to do so. But there are only so many hours in a sitting day, and we need to strike a balance between Question Time and the other demands on parliamentary time. There are already instances where the House has to sit late into the night to give Members time to debate Bills and Motions.

Members will recall that Parliament increased Question Time to two and a half hours last July and last October on my Motion. The Government is prepared to continue to take this approach, having regard to the number of questions and the other demands on parliamentary time. In appropriate cases, Ministers will also make statements to the House on important issues outside of Question Time, and Members can seek clarifications on these issues.

I would like to enquire about the original reason for this Standing Order which requires the presence of at least 25 Members who are supportive of a Motion when a debate is to be closed. It would appear that the spirit of this Standing Order is not just to ensure no infringement of the rights of the minority or an abuse of the rules of Parliament, but to ensure that there is a significant enough number of Members of Parliament who are present in the House to see through any debate and at the close of debate.",2,37,013-001-094-046-021-037,245
2017-05-08,Amendment of Standing Orders,013-001-094-046-021,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"However, what these amendments could considerably do is to create a public impression that the deletion of Standing Order No 54(4) supports the presence of fewer Members of Parliament in the House when the relevant question is put, bearing in mind that the deleted Standing Order does not call for a quorum of 25 Members but the presence of at least 25 Members who were in support of the Motion, a higher requirement necessitating a sufficiently robust number of Members of Parliament in the House.",3,38,013-001-094-046-021-038,246

Even though the Constitution in Article 57(1) is silent on the specific number of majority votes required, in effect, the deletion of this Standing Order supports the presence of fewer Members in the House at the closure of debate when the question is put to Members. Going back to the illustrated example, should Standing Order 54(4) remain, the same Motion would require at least eight more Members in the House, and that is assuming they intend to vote in favour of the Motion.",4,39,013-001-094-046-021-039,247

This is notwithstanding the fact that Article 56 of the Constitution requires a quorum of one-quarter of Members to be present when the House is in session failing which, Parliament shall be adjourned.

2017-05-08,Amendment of Standing Orders,013-001-094-046-021,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Let me explain. The proposal by the Standing Orders Committee is to amend Standing Order 18 to provide an option for the House to decide that a petition on need not be referred to the Public Petitions Committee (PPC). This might be done if the Speaker is of the view that the subject matter of the petition relates to a matter being already before the House, by a way of a Bill or Motion, in which case, the petition can be considered at the same time. The Committee's report states that this is to avoid the situation where the Bill or Motion has already disposed of the matter before the PPC considers the petition, making the petition moot.",2,45,013-001-094-046-021-045,253
2017-05-08,Amendment of Standing Orders,013-001-094-046-021,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Under the current Standing Orders, all petitions initiated by the public must be brought to this House through a Member who is not a signatory to the petition. In other words, the Member is not necessarily a person who shares the concerns of the petitioners, but is nearly a necessary conduit through which a petition may be presented to Parliament. The Standing Order provides that every such petition must be referred to the PPC, except in very limited circumstances. I am concern that this new power, if used routinely, would result in petitions not being given their due hearing, or send a signal that petitions are not important.",3,46,013-001-094-046-021-046,254
2017-05-08,Amendment of Standing Orders,013-001-094-046-021,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Some may ask what difference a reference to the PPC will make, since the contents of the petition can be read by Members during a debate on a related Bill or Motion. The difference to me is very significant. The PPC is a Standing Select Committee whose procedures are governed by Standing Order 103. The PPC is empowered to call for witnesses, papers and records and can independently report its opinion and its observations to Parliament. Compared with the procedures of the whole House, the PPC would have more time to fully investigate the grievances of the petitioners and hear them out personally if needed, and call for relevant documents, including documents from the Government.",4,47,013-001-094-046-021-047,255
2017-05-08,Amendment of Standing Orders,013-001-094-046-021,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The public petition procedure is provided for by the Standing Orders, and it is a vital link between Parliament and the members of the public. There is a due process that should be granted to petitioners. If the petition is not referred to the PPC, but is considered by the whole House during a debate of the Motion or Bill, the burden would naturally shift to the Member presenting the petition to fully convey the petitioners' concerns and grievances, which is probably expecting too much of the Member.",5,48,013-001-094-046-021-048,256

There are several issues which I would like to raise. First, the proposed amendments on the Elected Presidency, which are consequential to the constitutional amendments proposed last year. One of the proposals state that if the President goes against the advice of the majority of the Council of Presidential Advisers, and exercises his veto power, Parliament can override such a veto with a two-thirds majority. For this to happen, the President's grounds and Council's recommendation should be made available at least two days before a Motion is moved to overrule the President. I would like to clarify, what is the legal position if the Clerk fails to publish the notification that the President did not exercise his custodial powers within the constitutional time limit?",2,54,013-001-094-046-021-054,262
2017-05-08,Amendment of Standing Orders,013-001-094-046-021,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Second, on the Bill procedures, I welcome the proposal to increase the minimum interval from seven to 10 clear days as this will give more time for further deliberation on Bills. I also welcome the increase in the notice period for amendments from two clear days to four clear days as this will strike an appropriate balance between passing legislation in a timely way, while allowing Parliament adequate time for legislative scrutiny. I look forward to the proposed tracking of changes to amendment Bills as this will help Members while going through the various versions of the amendments and keep track of the evolution process of the Bill.",3,55,013-001-094-046-021-055,263
2017-05-08,Amendment of Standing Orders,013-001-094-046-021,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"On the issue of petitions, I agree that it will be beneficial for the Parliament to have the option of considering a petition together with a related Bill or a Motion, instead of sending the petition to the Public Petitions Committee. This is so that Parliament can have the benefit of considering the petition while debating the Bill or Motion. Members can then scrutinise the issues raised in the petition and a full debate can occur. Public interest will hence not be compromised.",4,56,013-001-094-046-021-056,264
2017-05-08,Amendment of Standing Orders,013-001-094-046-021,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"When it comes to Question Time, I speak on behalf of backbenchers that we would naturally prefer more time rather than less. However, it also means that if Question Time is increased, the time spent on other matters such as debating Bills and Motions will have to moderate. I recognise that the Government is meeting backbenchers midway by increasing Question Time on ad hoc basis and I hope that this can be done whenever the volume of business permits or an issue is of broad public interest. I also hope that Ministers will continue and perhaps also expand on the practice of making Ministerial Statements on significant issues of broad public interest to the House, in the spirit of accountability to Parliament. This will also give Members another avenue to ask questions on important issues and engage the Ministers on these issues.",5,57,013-001-094-046-021-057,265
2017-05-08,Amendment of Standing Orders,013-001-094-046-021,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Finally, on time management, I welcome the Leader's indication that the Government is prepared to sit longer hours to deal with increased Parliamentary business. This shows that the Government respects the important role that Members play in scrutinising and debating Government policy and proposed legislation. I understand that there are now no limits on how long Members can speak on each item of business and how long each item can be debated, but at the same time, it would not be prudent to prolong debates just because we can. It is ultimately the quality, rather than the length of the debate that matters.",6,58,013-001-094-046-021-058,266
2017-05-08,Amendment of Standing Orders,013-001-094-046-021,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"A search online showed that the longest Parliament session in a single sitting was in 1881 in the United Kingdom which lasted for 41.5 hours. Just last year, the Australian Senate sat for 28 hours before passing a Voting Reform Bill. This is one record that we might do well to avoid. For us to achieve a balanced state where important matters are sufficiently debated, I hope all sides of the House will practice self-discipline, including myself, and keep our speeches short and succinct.

2017-05-08,Amendment of Standing Orders,013-001-094-046-021,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"First, I would like to make three broad points. The debate today is not about the Constitutional amendments to the Elected President (EP). The amendment process is complete. We had hearings and the report by the Constitutional Commission, a White Paper in Parliament, and a full debate in Parliament last November. The Opposition made its points and the Government responded. The amendments were passed by Parliament and came into force last month. So far as the EP is concerned, there are only two narrow procedural issues − the procedural machinery for an overruling Motion and a notification where the President does not signify his decision on a measure passed by Parliament.",2,61,013-001-094-046-021-061,269

2017-05-08,Amendment of Standing Orders,013-001-094-046-021,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"First, I would like to refer to Mr Pritam Singh who raised the issue about sequence of Parliamentary Questions. There is no rocket science involved in the sequencing. If there are a lot of questions on the topic, they get put in front. If a question concerns a topical issue, it gets put in front. A balance is struck between questions from all sides of the House. The sequence of the questions on the Order Paper is decided by the Speaker. I give my views as the Leader of the House, but the Speaker has the final say.",5,64,013-001-094-046-021-064,272
2017-05-08,Amendment of Standing Orders,013-001-094-046-021,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"On Mr Pritam Singh's other issue about removing the 25-Member majority for closure of debate, I would just like to reiterate what the Committee has reported, that this requirement for a 25-Member majority is not consistent with Article 57(1) which provides that all questions proposed for a discussion in Parliament shall be determined by a majority of the votes of the Members present and voting. The requirement was laid down in colonial times. I asked the same question but we could not trace the real background. So, it must has been around for a long time and this is really a housekeeping amendment. The Government has no present intention to invoke that procedure to close debates. In any case, the Standing Order on quorum still stands and that is fixed at 25% of the total Members in the House. And that, by percentage, a quarter is more flexible − it reflects the changing number of Members in the House and therefore, I think it would be more relevant going forward.",6,65,013-001-094-046-021-065,273
2017-05-08,Amendment of Standing Orders,013-001-094-046-021,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Ms Sylvia Lim raised some concerns about the move to include in the Standing Order a Motion to consider petitions together with its related Bill or Motion. This amendment is a procedural one. If it is carried, the petition is considered by the House. Otherwise, the petition goes to the Public Petitions Committee. Either way, the petition will be considered. It is simply a question of how. So, there is no need for a separate debate.",7,66,013-001-094-046-021-066,274
2017-05-08,Amendment of Standing Orders,013-001-094-046-021,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In any case, I take Ms Sylvia Lim's point that as much as possible − and I am sure I speak for all my frontbench colleagues − we would like to consider all viewpoints brought to the attention of Parliament. But as you can appreciate, there are two parallel processes that are going on. Any petition could come in on the very day that we are having a debate on a Motion or Bill and it would be advantageous if we would have the ability to consider that petition together with the Motion or Bill, as what we have done with Nominated Member Mr Kok's petition. This would allow us the flexibility of including the facts and the views presented in the petition while not delaying the process that has already been on-going for the Bill or for the Motion. If the House feels strongly that a petition has to be considered separately by the Petitions Committee, they can always say no to this procedural Motion.",8,67,013-001-094-046-021-067,275
2017-05-08,Amendment of Standing Orders,013-001-094-046-021,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"May I just wrap up by stepping back, Madam, and looking at the big picture. First, it is important to the Government that we spend time in the House to explain the laws and policies that we propose. The cut and thrust of Parliamentary debate informs the public on the important issues of the day. Accounting to Parliament is something that the Government takes seriously. The Prime Minister's open letter to Government Members of Parliament after the 2015 General Election underscored this.",9,68,013-001-094-046-021-068,276
2017-05-08,Amendment of Standing Orders,013-001-094-046-021,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Second, within the House, it is important that we strike a good balance between the different demands on Parliamentary time. Time spent on one item of business means time lost to another. Good time management means we do not have to cut off debate. Good time management means we have time to debate backbenchers' Motions like we did last month. Good time management means we can have more Question Time if need be. Good time management does not mean that Members should pull their punches or mute their criticisms of Government policy. But it does require Members to focus and deliver their key points succinctly and sharply. If anything, a succinct point is more likely to be more impactful and newsworthy than a meandering speech.",10,69,013-001-094-046-021-069,277
2017-05-08,Amendment of Standing Orders,013-001-094-046-021,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Third, we also need to balance the other demands on Members' time. Members know full well that a good debate in the House needs hours of preparation and homework outside. Members also need to remain in touch with different segments of society so that their arguments in the House are grounded in reality. Elected Members need to hear the concerns of the constituents. Ministers need to run their Ministries and formulate policies. If we sit in the House day in and day out, not only will we run out of meaningful things to say, we risk neglecting our work outside Parliament. At the end of the day, after everything is said, we must make a decision and carry on. Robust debate must cumulate in decisive action. In the US, a Senator has actually gone to the extent of reading bedtime stories in the Senate to filibuster proceedings. I do not wish to see this House moving towards that state.",11,70,013-001-094-046-021-070,278
2017-05-08,Amendment of Standing Orders,013-001-094-046-021,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"In this regard, I agree with Mr Desmond Choo's point that this is something that requires Members on all sides of the House to do their part. On policy and politics, we may well disagree and disagree sharply. After all, the very purpose of this House is to be an arena for a contest of hearts and minds. But as Members of Parliament, we also share a common duty to maintain the standing of Parliament as an effective and efficient institution.

Unfortunately, I think when it comes to sequencing Question Time, it is probably more art than science, primarily because very often, we are unable to determine beforehand the length of speeches that Members will make. We run the risk at times, as we have seen in the last sitting on 4 April, the sitting had to be extended to 10.00 pm. So, it is not something that we could envisage in advance or with some scientific formula. But let us put it this way. If we find that there are Questions being piled up and if the rest of the agenda allows us to do so, we will definitely extend the Question Time, as I have done so twice last year.",1,77,013-001-094-046-021-077,285

These countries had ratified the Convention before the Convention came into force. Notwithstanding the above, I am in support of the Bill.",9,24,013-001-094-046-022-024,311

2017-05-08,Public Entertainments and Meetings (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-046-025,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, on licensing. The licensing of public entertainment establishments vests in the Licensing Officer. For those who wish to appeal against the Licensing Officer's decisions, the Bill proposes the setting up of a new Public Entertainment Appeals Board to replace the Minister as the appellate authority in certain types of appeals. Clause 15 amends section 16 of the Act to provide for the Appeals Board to be the authority to hear appeals against the Licensing Officer's decisions if the appeal is from a specified establishment or a prescribed class of applicants or licensees. At the same time, other appeals will continue to go to the Minister. I would like to know what the general division of work will be between the Appeals Board and the Minister. Is it the intention to let the Appeals Board hear appeals which may be of a more routine nature, while the Minister retains the power to hear appeals in more difficult or complex cases? Or is it vice versa, with the Appeals Board dealing with the more difficult appeals?",3,70,013-001-094-046-025-070,507
2017-05-08,Public Entertainments and Meetings (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-046-025,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"My second set of queries relate to enforcement as set out in clauses 17 and 18 of the Bill. Clause 17 amends the current Act significantly in terms of the right of entry and inspection of enforcement officers. The current Act empowers the Licensing Officer and police officers to enter premises to ascertain if licensing conditions are complied with. The Bill will include a new category of officer, called an ""authorised person"", who, together with the Licensing Officer and police officers, will be called ""inspecting officers"". These inspecting officers will be given enhanced enforcement powers to enter and inspect public entertainment outlets. Earlier, in his Second Reading speech, the Parliamentary Secretary clarified that, as far as authorised persons are concerned, they would not have powers of forced entry and arrests. But it is also true that the Bill gives these authorised persons enhanced powers in confrontational scenarios, such as requiring production of information, accessing computers, interviewing suspects on site, and requiring witnesses to provide explanations of documents or information found.",4,71,013-001-094-046-025-071,508

According to clause 5 of the Bill, an individual may be appointed as an ""authorised person"" if he is ""suitably trained"". What does ""suitably trained"" mean? If the Government is referring to auxiliary police officers becoming authorised officers for licensing inspections, does their training cover the necessary skill competencies to handle the confrontational scenarios envisaged in clause 17?",5,72,013-001-094-046-025-072,509

2017-05-08,Public Entertainments and Meetings (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-046-025,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"First, the amendments to section 4 of the Act allows the appointed Licensing Officer to appoint trained individuals who need not be public servants as authorised persons under the Act. My Parliamentary colleagues, Dr Intan and Ms Sylvia Lim, also spoke about this point. It appears that under the proposed amendments, these persons would be deemed as public servants when exercising their powers under the Act. This is in contrast to the Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Act 2015, which only provides for auxiliary police officers or police officers to be an approved person under that Act to carry out licensing functions. What is the rationale for allowing private sector vendors to carry out functions of the Licensing Officer under the proposed provisions? How will these private sector vendors be selected and are there other similar uses of the private sector for licensing or other analogous matters in Singapore?",3,84,013-001-094-046-025-084,521

The explanatory notes of the Bill state that this takes into account considerations of whether the responsible officer is a fit and proper person, similar to the approach taken in the Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Act. May I ask if the criteria and requirements that relate to the responsible officer also take into account his character, capability and reputation, similar to the guidelines on the criteria under the Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Act?",4,85,013-001-094-046-025-085,522

Could the Parliamentary Secretary please clarify whether proceedings include investigations that have been commenced against the licensee even if the licensee has not been formally charged in court with any offence yet?

The proposed section 14(2A) presently does not take into account such foreign proceedings. Yet, this may be relevant, especially if the licensee or the responsible officer is involved in operating similar businesses in other countries and foreign proceedings have been brought against him in that regard. Alternatively, would such considerations be instead taken into account in the fit and proper criteria to determine whether the licence should be suspended or cancelled under the proposed amendments to section 14(2) of the Act? If so, would there be a need to widen the language used in that provision to include responsible officers of the licensees and persons having substantial control over these licensees.",6,87,013-001-094-046-025-087,524

Could the hon Parliamentary Secretary please clarify what sorts of conditions are contemplated? Would the Ministry also be providing guidelines on how the discretion to impose conditions would be exercised? This would promote greater certainty for producers of the arts, who could then have these guidelines in mind at the outset when planning and producing their art exhibitions and performances.",7,88,013-001-094-046-025-088,525

I note now that two relevant appeal authorities have been proposed in respect of appeals against appealable decisions of the Public Entertainment Licensing Officer, namely, the newly constituted Public Entertainment Appeal Board for decisions involving prescribed specified establishments or a prescribed class of licensees and, in any other cases, to the Minister responsible for public entertainment. Could the Parliamentary Secretary please elaborate on what type of specified establishments or class of licensees would be prescribed that would involve the Public Entertainment Appeal Board? I believe a similar point was raised by the hon Member Ms Sylvia Lim. In addition, what is the rationale for having an independent Public Entertainment Appeal Board that deals with appeals against certain decisions involving these prescribed specified establishments or class of licensees, whilst appeals against all other decisions continue to be dealt with by the Minister?",8,89,013-001-094-046-025-089,526

There are few pubs and games arcades along Sembawang Road, which is near Goodlink Park, and I have been receiving feedback from residents. They complain about cigarettes butts, littering, noise, public nuisance and so on. Some residents are worried about the bad influence on their children. I have given these feedback to URA, and URA replied that this is not under their purview because the games arcades are registered under Registry of Society, which is under MHA. So, MHA told me that they will monitor, but until now, residents are still living under all these influences and pressures that they do not like to have.",11,137,013-001-094-046-025-137,574

However, I would like to talk about our public entertainment places. These places can bring about two types of problems. First, customers get into a fight. Do we require security personnel at these places to undergo extra training to stop the fighting? This will reduce the burden on our Police force, as well as potential harm caused by these fights.

Owners of these places must have realised that if they want to have a profitable business, they must do so with commensurating responsibility for the people whose presence they profit.

The provision to allow for immediate suspension of the licence once proceedings have commenced against the licensee or the responsible officer would also serve to address a current situation where errant outlets continue to operate despite having accumulated numerous breaches. This will send a strong signal to the licensees to keep their outlets in order. However, as highlighted by our parliamentary colleagues, Ms Lee Bee Wah and Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef, one concern still lingers − the usage of proxies to apply for a public entertainment licence.

For instance, we introduced the requirement for all arts entertainment to be classified regardless of the venue that they are held at, be it at public entertainment establishments licensed by the Police, such as nightclubs, or at other venues, such as theatres and concert halls.

Each arts entertainment should be assessed on its own merit and different conditions may be required depending on the content and the form of the arts entertainment.

Classification serves to protect the young, while allowing adults to make informed viewing choices on a wider range of arts content. In making its classification decisions, IMDA aims to strike a balance between reflecting generally accepted social norms, while giving due consideration to the arts entertainment's artistic and educational merits.",9,185,013-001-094-046-025-185,622

Content suitable for a general audience, including children, will be given a General rating, while those that are targeted at a more mature audience can either be rated Advisory, Advisory 16 or R18. Content that goes beyond the R18 rating, for example, those which may undermine national interest, are likely to cause feelings of ill-will between different racial or religious groups or are excessive and/or exploitative in their depictions, will be disallowed. The existing framework thus already addresses Er Dr Lee Bee Wah's concern about the misuse of arts entertainment as a means to offend or to promote radical ideology.",10,186,013-001-094-046-025-186,623

IMDA keeps itself up to date with the developments in the arts scene through engaging stakeholders, such as the Arts Consultative Panel, the National Arts Council, and the arts community.

This is a positive development. But it also means that with higher demand and, therefore, higher supply of arts entertainment, IMDA, as the regulator, will have its work cut out. However, through regular engagements and dialogues with the stakeholders, I believe that IMDA will continue to serve its role well in safeguarding the public space for arts entertainment, even as our arts scene continues to become more diverse and vibrant.

These were committed by about 20% of the 2,700 PE establishment licensees. About 90% of these breaches were minor, such as failing to maintain a proper record of all employees, or failing to ensure that performers do not mingle with patrons. The remaining 10% were major breaches, such as overcrowding, which pose a public safety risk. There were 38 incidents of violent crime, which include serious hurt and rioting, in PE establishments. The situation is under control and Members have also noted this in their speeches. We are proactively managing the situation, and this Bill strengthens our regulatory levers to ensure that the situation continues to be well-managed.

Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef and Mr Melvin Yong asked if we can better identify unsuitable persons that hide behind proxies when applying for new licences. This is an issue which we take seriously. At point of licence application, the Police will screen the applicant's background carefully to ascertain if he has links to errant establishments, as well as the applicant's general records. There are also regular checks that the Police conduct on PE establishments and the operators after the licence application.",5,194,013-001-094-046-025-194,631

In 2016, there were only 12 cases of unlicensed PE establishments. We are proposing to raise the fine for unlicensed PE as a matter of principle. A person who disregards the law entirely should be dealt with more harshly than a licensed person who breached licence conditions. Today, the maximum fine for these offences is the same at $10,000. The Bill increases the maximum fine for providing unlicensed PE to $20,000.",12,201,013-001-094-046-025-201,638

In addition, such operators may also be liable for other offences, for example, the unlicensed sale of liquor under the Liquor Control Act.

The Police have encountered PE establishments that locked their premises on arrival of enforcement officers. This provides them opportunity to dispose evidence and lead time to stop any lawful activities. Currently, a search warrant from courts is needed before the police can gain entry into the premises for the purpose of licensing checks.

It also accords protection to colours as a design feature. Colours can play a significant role in the appearance of products. Businesses that look to build a strong association between a particular colour scheme and their products can now protect such colour schemes as part of their designs. I should clarify that our intent is not to accord design protection to colours per se. For example, a designer cannot simply claim the colour orange, without any other design feature, for its vacuum cleaner, and prevent all others from using the colour orange for their vacuum cleaners.",14,15,013-001-094-046-026-015,695

Clauses 3(a) to 3(c) of the Bill amend the current legislation so that in commissioning situations, the designer will be treated as the owner of the design by default.

2017-05-08,Registered Designs (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-046-026,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Generally, only designs which are new may be registered under the RDA. A design that is registered or published before the application to register is filed, is not considered new. Therefore, it cannot be registered. However, section 8 of the RDA contains a few narrow exceptions to this general rule. For example, if the design has been displayed at one of the few recognised international exhibitions, and the application was filed within six months of the opening of the exhibition, then the design can be registered. This six-month period is commonly referred to as the ""grace period"".",24,25,013-001-094-046-026-025,705
2017-05-08,Registered Designs (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-046-026,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"We have received feedback from the industry that the current grace period provision should not be so restrictive. It needs to support modern business practices, where designers increasingly need to disclose their designs before applying to register them. For example, they could be trying to source for investors at an exhibition that is outside the narrow list of recognised international exhibitions.",25,26,013-001-094-046-026-026,706

2017-05-08,Registered Designs (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-046-026,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),It should be emphasised that disclosing a design before applying for protection still carries risks.

2017-05-08,Registered Designs (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-046-026,The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),This amendment will make it easier for applicants to file multiple designs in a single application.

2017-05-08,Registered Designs (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-046-026,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),I believe these changes will reduce barriers for smaller players in the market such as Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and freelance professionals in the creative and design fields to seek protection of their intellectual property rights and benefit from their designs. There are three key revisions to the Act.,2,39,013-001-094-046-026-039,719
2017-05-08,Registered Designs (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-046-026,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"First, the scope of registrable designs under the Act has been broadened. Second, the designer of the registrable design is now the recognised owner instead of the commissioner of the work; and third, the administrative burden and cost of registration will be reduced. I will address each of these key revisions.",3,40,013-001-094-046-026-040,720
2017-05-08,Registered Designs (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-046-026,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"First, by broadening the scope of protection to include designs of non-physical products and colour as a design feature, designers will be able to register a wide range of designs and consequently allow for their exploitation of a greater range of creative expression. The extension of coverage to virtual designs or non-physical designs recognises the increasing prevalence of virtual products as we become more immersed in virtual environments.",4,41,013-001-094-046-026-041,721
2017-05-08,Registered Designs (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-046-026,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Removing the requirement for application of the design to an article by way of an industrial process is also a boon for designers and small design businesses. In the 2014 National Design Industry Survey, it was found that 86% of design firms in Singapore were micro-SMEs. In Singapore, there has also been an observable rise in interest in artisanal work, craftsmanship and the provision of bespoke handcrafted products ranging from furniture, bicycles, stationery, clothes, shoes and bags to jewellery to cater to consumers' pursuit of individualism.",5,42,013-001-094-046-026-042,722
2017-05-08,Registered Designs (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-046-026,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"The Creative Craftsman Apprenticeship Programme, launched in February 2014 and offered by the SFIC Institute is a Place and Train programme aimed at those who want to pursue a career as a craftsman in the furniture industry. The programme has attracted entrants from various age groups, qualifications and industries wishing to make a career switch into carpentry and 70 Singaporeans have since graduated from the programme. Businesses and freelancers offering bespoke handcrafted products are usually smaller players in the market who would not have been able to seek protection under the Act as their designs are not applied to articles by industrial process. With the proposed amendments to the Act, designs for handcrafted items can be registered, thereby providing these artisans, craftsmen and small businesses with an avenue for protection of their work.",6,43,013-001-094-046-026-043,723
2017-05-08,Registered Designs (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-046-026,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Second, recognising the designer as the owner of the design for commissioned work instead of the commissioner of the work, shifts some amount of bargaining power to the designer when it comes to negotiating the terms of engagement for commissioned work. Based on the current law, designers, especially those from smaller business outfits or freelancers, would find themselves hard-pressed to wrangle ownership from the commissioner of the work. Some designers may not even be aware that the position at law is such and omit to negotiate terms of ownership of the commissioned work with the commissioner of the work.",7,44,013-001-094-046-026-044,724
2017-05-08,Registered Designs (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-046-026,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"This amendment will not only align the legal position in Singapore with other jurisdictions, for example, Australia, EU, Japan and the US, but is also timely, given the advent of the gig economy.",8,45,013-001-094-046-026-045,725
2017-05-08,Registered Designs (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-046-026,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"In the recent Graduate Employment Survey released in February 2017, it was found that while the overall employment rate for NTU's art, design and media graduates has been at about 80% from 2014 to 2016, the full-time permanent employment rate dropped from 68% in 2014 to 46.6% in 2016. With the increase of freelancers in the art, design and creative industries, this amendment can provide freelancers with greater bandwidth to make strategic decisions on the terms of engagement for commissioned work.",9,46,013-001-094-046-026-046,726
2017-05-08,Registered Designs (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-046-026,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"Third, amendments aimed at reducing the administrative burden and cost of registration such as through the allowing of the registration of two or more designs in one application and allowing for correction of non-compliance with formal requirements in earlier registration applications greatly reduce barriers to access intellectual property protection. Ease of registration and more affordable registration processes will benefit small businesses and freelancers working with smaller margins. Allowing for a 12-month period for qualified disclosure of the design prior to registration also takes into consideration practical needs of the creative industry to test their designs in the market.",10,47,013-001-094-046-026-047,727
2017-05-08,Registered Designs (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-046-026,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"With these amendments, designers in Singapore can also seek international protection with greater ease. Through the Hague system, designers can register their designs in Singapore and apply for international protection of the design in member countries of the Hague Union. This is in alignment with our national industry transformation efforts and the Design 2025 Masterplan to encourage our design firms to internationalise.",11,48,013-001-094-046-026-048,728
2017-05-08,Registered Designs (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-046-026,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"While efforts have been made to widen the scope of protection under the Act and to increase access to protection of designs, these efforts will come to naught if the public lacks awareness of these rights. It is notable that out of a total of 4,268 designs filed at the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) in 2014, only 818 are designs filed by Singapore-based or local applicants. In the review of the Act conducted by the Ministry of Law and IPOS, it was found that the level of awareness on the use and enforcement of design rights in Singapore appeared to be low.",12,49,013-001-094-046-026-049,729
2017-05-08,Registered Designs (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-046-026,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast),"I therefore urge for more to be done to ensure that SMEs and freelancers in the design industry are aware of the availability of such protection and know when, how and where to seek enforcement of their rights. With the passing of the Bill, education and outreach efforts need to be made to raise awareness of design rights and address overlaps of copyright and trademark protection with the registered designs regime.

The ability to develop and maintain a robust intellectual property strategy is crucial for businesses and freelancers alike.

2017-05-08,Registered Designs (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-046-026,Ms Indranee Rajah,"The first point is about the requirement for a non-physical product to have an intrinsic utilitarian function. The registered designs regime is intended to protect design features of commercial products with useful functions. For example, designs intended to be applied to articles which are works of sculpture will be refused registration. This can be seen from section 7 of the RDA read with rule 9 of the Registered Designs Rules. Further, the Third Schedule of the Registered Designs Rules gives an idea of the products for which designs can be protected. These include − table knives, forks and spoons, and jewellery, for example.",10,75,013-001-094-046-026-075,755

The registered designs regime and the patent regime confer different protection.

In contrast, functional features may be protected by patents, if they fulfil the patentability requirements.",14,79,013-001-094-046-026-079,759

2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"The first issue is the balancing of academic and applied social sciences. Academic social sciences tend to be highly specialised, with the individual disciplines developing their own lineage of knowledge traditions and research methodologies. Academic social sciences are also more concerned with producing new theoretical knowledge of cause-and-effect. Practical solutions and policy implications are secondary concerns. Applied social sciences invert the emphases of academic social sciences. Applied social sciences are multi-disciplinary in structure and inter-disciplinary in approach, with the focus on applying existing knowledge to understand specific social problems and develop practical solutions.",3,58,013-001-094-046-027-058,825

To be effective, applied social sciences must be relevant to both academic social scientists and policy makers. There is a need to balance academic and applied social sciences in the University, even if the University should focus on applied social sciences. As paradoxical as this may sound, I urge the Minister to safeguard the autonomy of the applied social scientists from policy makers, even as we seek greater relevance of social research to social policy, and ensure the balance of academic and applied social sciences in the Singapore University of Social Sciences.",5,60,013-001-094-046-027-060,827

With this sixth Autonomous University, Singapore will have an enhanced and diverse higher education field. But a closer look at the diversity reveals yet another risk. The three older Universities, National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University, are academic in orientation. There is also a division of labour between them. NUS has the full suite of academic disciplines and more, with cutting-edge residential and liberal arts colleges in University Town. NTU is focused on the technological sciences, while SMU specialises in management sciences. The three newer universities, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore Institute of Technology and now SUSS, offer applied learning. There is also a division of labour between them.

This landscape is becoming increasingly complex. Let us take the institution of the family as an example. It is no longer tenable in sociology to speak of a single form of family, that is, the modern nuclear family underpinned by marriage and functionally set up for making and growing babies to become good citizens. Individual choices, new forms of partnership, new ways of childbearing and childrearing, dissolutions of marriages have led to a plurality of families and complex new social problems.",9,64,013-001-094-046-027-064,831

In academic social sciences, the research problems and analyses take place in the university, and the social field matters only as the site where data is collected to be brought back into the university. Applied social sciences work with communities to define research problems and data, and analyses are often generated in collaboration with community partners. Results of the research are not just published as findings, but are applied as practical solutions to be continuously evaluated.",11,66,013-001-094-046-027-066,833

Applied social sciences have had many decades of development in Anglo-American universities, and one of the problems that have been identified is precisely this problem of applied social sciences becoming too academic and losing its community grounding. One of the ways to mitigate this is for the university to work with community partners to set up community-based research centres.",12,67,013-001-094-046-027-067,834
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"This would necessitate at least two changes to the structure of research funding. First, fewer research grants would be attached to academic research teams based in the university but more grants would be given to community-based research centres. The administration of these grants would have to be more flexible and adapted to specific needs on the ground. Second, instead of solely using academic impact measurements to evaluate the performance of research, for example, publications in journals and citation indices, social impact measurements will have to be developed to take into account the relevance of applied social science research.",13,68,013-001-094-046-027-068,835

The dearth of associational life has driven many of us to join the national associations of other countries, for example, for me, the American Sociological Association. We also need an academy as our representative body to advance the governance and standards of research and teaching in the social sciences. The establishment of SUSS presents us with a good opportunity to grow the intellectual eco-system for social science.",16,71,013-001-094-046-027-071,838
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Beyond these four issues, I have a more immediate practical matter to bring up. The question that some SIM University alumni have with the metamorphosis of their alma mater to SUSS is whether their certificates could be reprinted under the SUSS banner. Some have argued that this should not be, as education in SUSS would be of a higher quality than in SIM University, and thus it would be an unfair upgrade for the alumni. This is a view that seems to echo the popular stereotype and condescension of SIM University as inferior. It is precisely because of such popular myths that we should not unfairly stigmatise SIM University alumni. Already, the change to SUSS is being read as an upgrade from an inferior species to a superior creature.",17,72,013-001-094-046-027-072,839
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Without the hungry caterpillar, there would not be a beautiful butterfly. We should not deny the contribution of SIM University alumni to the making of SUSS and deprive SUSS of that important history and a body of proud alumni. The one most important single line that connects SIM University and SUSS is the emphasis on lifelong learning. I would like to suggest that SUSS extends their excellent Alumni Continuing Education Plus Scheme allowing graduates to enjoy up to two free modular courses to all SIM University alumni. Upon completion of one module, alumni could then get a reprint of a consolidated degree certificate under the SUSS brand.",18,73,013-001-094-046-027-073,840

I have raised four issues with the unprecedented establishment of an entire university dedicated to applied social sciences. I sincerely hope that we will successfully navigate these issues and come out on the winning side, which would be a big win for Singapore society. I also hope that we would do the right thing for the SIM University alumni who have done their part in the making of SUSS. Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.",19,74,013-001-094-046-027-074,841

It is a good decision on three counts.",1,75,013-001-094-046-027-075,842
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"One, there is no other University in Singapore that currently occupies and claims that unique domain space of the applied social sciences. As Singapore's social demographics change and the needs and demands in society become graver and more challenging, the need for more in-depth analyses and application of social science studies becomes correspondingly very critical.",2,76,013-001-094-046-027-076,843
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"The second reason why SUSS is a good decision is this. UniSIM was a private school with a known brand and history of more than 20 years. The Government's support of this private university will help fulfil its promise to create more University places in the public education space. This is a promise that was made when Minister Lawrence Wong was helming the tertiary education space in MOE then. SUSS will, indeed, help meet the brewing aspirations of many fresh undergraduates and working adults to get a first degree.",3,77,013-001-094-046-027-077,844
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"But the most important reason why this Bill reflects a good decision is this. UniSIM's, and now SUSS', unique experience of primarily catering to busy working adults pursuing further studies falls squarely in place with Singapore's SkillsFuture movement. Our SkillsFuture movement is an important shift which encourages lifelong learning and skills mastery, and it features a very important type of education for our future economy.",4,78,013-001-094-046-027-078,845
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Perhaps less known to the public is the fact that SUSS, then UniSIM, is a forerunner in the provision of e-learning in the Singapore tertiary space. Even before other universities jumped on the bandwagon of digital education, before the term ""online learning"" became a mantra, the former UniSIM had been investing in and learning the business of e-learning and blending it with face-to-face class interactions. The purpose was to deliver programmes anytime, anywhere, on any PDA, via multi-media channels and blended learning, to meet the demanding schedules of its busy adult learners. At a time when most tertiary institutions are doing the catch-up on online and blended learning, SUSS is already way ahead in digital education and catering to an adult learner population in a fast-paced work setting.",5,79,013-001-094-046-027-079,846
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Sir, the Bill appears to be uncomplicated − the formalisation, scoping and funding of the new AU − SUSS from its former private school status. Clause 3 sets out the function of the university company. The main object of SUSS will be to ""provide lifelong learning programmes, with a disciplinary focus in the social sciences, for adults"". Clause 8 provides for Parliament to give funding and requires that the moneys given may only be applied for such objects. But the devil is in the details.",6,80,013-001-094-046-027-080,847
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"So, I would like to be assured by the Minister in three specific areas so that SUSS would not end up becoming just like another ordinary University, losing its edge and the opportunity to help put Singapore on the map of future learning.",7,81,013-001-094-046-027-081,848
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"The first is to do with positioning. SUSS' positioning, both in terms of what it offers and who the target learners are. Whilst Social Science is an appealing focus, a search online would reveal that branches of Social Science can cover a full spectrum from anthropology, education, social work, business studies, economics, political science, psychology to sustainability studies. But at the same time, to add to the complication, there are also talks amongst many education experts that there is a need, like what Assoc Prof. Daniel Goh said, to ensure that subjects are not taught in silo. There is a real need to blend some of the subjects, and that is what many educators are talking about. I, therefore, would like to seek the Minister's views on the long-term positioning of a University such as SUSS.",8,82,013-001-094-046-027-082,849
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"In addition, if SUSS is to provide lifelong learning programmes for adults, I seek the Minister's clarification on what ""adult learners"" actually are. I mean, who are they really? The current age of SUSS' undergrads today is 29 years old, I was told. Although this is older than the 19-year-olds who normally enter the other Universities, how would SUSS cater to working adults who are much older and, especially, those who decide to take up new skills or a new second or third career? In a world where old jobs disappear and future jobs requiring new skills emerge, is there an intent for MOE to give these older learners more than one bite of the cherry in their pursuit of tertiary studies? Can they pursue several tertiary level courses throughout their lifetime? Is there a space for that?",9,83,013-001-094-046-027-083,850
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),My second query is in the area of resourcing and funding. SUSS will need to be sufficiently resourced to allow it to acquire the faculty to deepen the disciplinary focus of Social Sciences and to conduct applied research in the Social Sciences.,10,84,013-001-094-046-027-084,851
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"In addition, there is a great opportunity to further propel the SUSS' traditional strength in online and blended learning. SUSS can become a regional or global lead in not just a provider of digital education for adult learners but also a provider of expert services, consultancy in education technology and design.",11,85,013-001-094-046-027-085,852
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"The current UniSIM financial model that was inherited appears to be an entrepreneurial model using primarily part-time faculty members to support a large proportion of part-time adult learner undergrads. Whilst the entrepreneurial and nimble spirit of SUSS should never be lost, the new AU must receive a funding support that allows it to delve deeper into its social science domain and also not to lose its traditional strength.",12,86,013-001-094-046-027-086,853
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"My third concern is on how a University like SUSS would be evaluated by the Ministry, the Government, by its learners and also the public. The commonly held success criteria by which Universities are gauged include the popular ranking systems − research robustness, publications in journals and the like. SUSS will need to establish a set of KPIs and criteria that reflect its desired positioning in the overall tertiary education landscape.",13,87,013-001-094-046-027-087,854

SUSS presents an exciting opportunity to paint and deliver the vision of what future learning for Singapore's working adults and Singapore's lifelong learning adults can be.

This expansion has been driven by the rising educational aspirations of Singaporeans and made possible by increasing Government expenditures on education. Between 1990 and 2000, total Government expenditure on education nearly tripled. From 2000 to 2015, total expenditure slowed as development expenditure on education plateaued.

This point has been brought up before. For instance, during the debate on the President's Address in 2011, Mr Ang Wei Neng asked about the difference between the subsidy rates for part-time and full-time degree programmes.

There are several schemes currently available. Despite this, publicly-funded tertiary education in Singapore still represents a significant cost to low-income families. In its commitment to ensure that all deserving students are given a chance to achieve tertiary education, the Government as well as other organisations offer a range of schemes. These include bursaries, loans, and scholarships, and are meant ""to cover not only the remaining tuition fees payable but also to help students defray their costs of living"".

Social science is a very broad spectrum term and really, as some of them say, even medicine is a social science on a grand scale. Change is a constant in our lives and restructuring is also part and parcel of this.",1,117,013-001-094-046-027-117,884
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),I have a few clarifications pertaining to this Bill,2,118,013-001-094-046-027-118,885
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Firstly, UniSIM was a private entity before and now comes under the jurisdiction of MOE as an autonomous public institution. In this context, can the Minister update us on the migration process as well as the support rendered in this direction. Will there be any major changes or revamp that we will see, especially pertaining to the governance structure, the educators and also, I assume, a proportion of them will be retained and also developed?",3,119,013-001-094-046-027-119,886
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Secondly, from the students' perspective, will there be any differences in the entry requirements and eligibility criteria for existing courses and also faculties as well as the new courses that we are going to see? What kind of numbers and increments are we projecting in terms of student intake in the next, perhaps, two to five years?",4,120,013-001-094-046-027-120,887
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Thirdly, also being a public University, we now know that the students there will be subjected to receiving tertiary support from all the various sources that are available to students from other Universities as well. I have a concern pertaining to the adult learners who are enrolled at this University because they may not be applicable to receive some of the funding support that may be applicable to the full-time students. Therefore, perhaps, it will be good at this point in time and also at this juncture of development of Singapore to see how we can help support adult learning so that they can continue lifelong learning and also to learn, unlearn and relearn, which is, really, an important mantra in the world of today's business.",5,121,013-001-094-046-027-121,888
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Fourthly, UniSIM has had a strong culture and outlook in service learning and exposures for students including both local as well as overseas experiential learning and project work. I hope that this will be retained and perhaps even developed and enhanced even further with collaboration and partnership with the other Autonomous Universities in Singapore and overseas as well.",6,122,013-001-094-046-027-122,889
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"UniSIM has its appeal to the adult learners as we have heard over and over again today. And also there is currently a ""pay as you study scheme"" which is available for adult learners. This according to many has injected some level of flexibility into the curriculum and also the payment structure. It is relevant and quite a proportion of the students who are adult learners are actually tapping on the scheme. This is slightly different form other Universities where payment and fees is done by the number of years or semesters a student is in the school, for example. Thus, for the SUSS now, which model is going to be utilised and better still if we can have hybrid model so that there is more flexibility for our adult learners.",7,123,013-001-094-046-027-123,890
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade),"Mr Deputy Speaker, a degree is really a degree. But it is really what the holder of the degree can do, will do or is willing to do. If he can learn, unlearn and relearn and make himself relevant to industry, to the practice of his industry and business, then that is what we really want. I support the Bill.",8,124,013-001-094-046-027-124,891

I have a few questions though.",1,125,013-001-094-046-027-125,892
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"If I may ask the Minister, in conjunction with SkillsFuture as well as the need to develop a dual education track, will the new SUSS consider a professional development academy? This would be in addition to the Academy of Social Sciences that my Parliamentary colleague referred to earlier. This would be focused on the professional skills. This is something that is similarly done currently, in conferring both certificates and Masters qualifications at NUS, NTU and SMU. Perhaps, SUSS could also consider doing so as well.",2,126,013-001-094-046-027-126,893
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"My second question would be, within social sciences, what is the niche that SUSS wishes to occupy, keeping a firm eye on the job market. When we actually producing students within SUSS, what are the disciplines that they would be occupying and working in? When we say applied social sciences, what are the jobs that we are thinking of?",3,127,013-001-094-046-027-127,894
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"Put differently, what is the specific strategic development model and external collaborations that the Ministry has in mind for SUSS? If we were to think of NUS as either a Yale or Harvard, SUTD and SIT as MIT of Singapore, SMU as Wharton or University of London, what would be SUSS' comparator? What would be the model that we would use?",4,128,013-001-094-046-027-128,895
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"And how much cross-AU collaborations would we find? I would add my voice to what was raised earlier by Assoc Prof Daniel Goh when he said that there is not that much cross-AU collaborations or even intra-university collaborations but there is a lot of inter-university collaborations between Singapore Universities and international universities. So, is this going to be growing? Is SUSS going to be perhaps a dynamo of inter-university collaborations within Singapore using professional development and continuing lifelong learning as the basis to do so?",5,129,013-001-094-046-027-129,896
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"My third question would be, looking at clause 5, how much involvement would the Ministry have in the research agenda of SUSS? When we think about social development, that is the core focus of SUSS. Would the projects that are being proposed by the academics within the University be in collaboration with the Government agencies or would we be able to see projects that are also being proposed in collaboration with businesses as well, in terms of social development?",6,130,013-001-094-046-027-130,897
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member),"Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, I must say that I think the University has already at this stage pulled off a coup in hiring Prof Leslie Chew, a well-known Senior Counsel in Singapore, a commercial litigator, as its first inaugural Dean of that University. If that is anything to go by for the third law school at SUSS, I think we are going to be in for a treat. Mr Deputy Speaker, I support this Bill.",7,131,013-001-094-046-027-131,898
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill and I am particularly happy of UniSIM's restructuring to become the sixth Autonomous University offering studies in social sciences.",1,132,013-001-094-046-027-132,899
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The restructured University is a step forward. It is good that we give focus on producing graduates in social work and early childhood education, which are areas where there is a need to shore up our pool of trained manpower in this area. I am also pleased that the University will also be running courses to produce graduates in human resource management.",2,133,013-001-094-046-027-133,900
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Social science, as we know, and most of the speakers have mentioned, is known as a very broad subject on the scientific study of human society and social relationships.",3,134,013-001-094-046-027-134,901
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Sometimes, the word ""social science"" conjures an image of people working in a social work or teaching environment only. However, the roles available within this discipline is, in fact, very wide as well as focusing on a wide range of issues. All said, the social services sector is expecting some 3,000 job openings over the next two years. Hopefully, with the training of more social scientists, we can overcome societal issues in Singapore and build stronger ties.",4,135,013-001-094-046-027-135,902
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I would like to ask the Minister if the University will accept those who possess Diploma in Social Sciences to go for an upgrade in a degree. This would be particularly helpful if such programmes can be run on a part-time basis, as I believe many of them would be working adults.",5,136,013-001-094-046-027-136,903
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Speaking of relationships, it is equally important that we also produce graduates who are specialised in the area of human resource. With so much being said about quality of life, finding a balance between productivity and rewards, and in times when the various sectors are facing headwinds resulting in staff downsizing, good and competent HR practitioners are important to handle such issues sensitively and advise management on how to bridge gaps between employers and the unions.",6,137,013-001-094-046-027-137,904
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Can I ask if the SUSS or the new university will seek to collaborate with the Ong Teng Cheong Labour Leadership Institute so that the students can get a better grasp of studies in Singapore's trade unionism, for example? The Institute has a treasure trove of information and historical archives that would do well to help students in understanding the tripartite relations in Singapore's society.",7,138,013-001-094-046-027-138,905
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Another important programme that SUSS may or will offer are courses in law which focus on family and criminal law. Perhaps, the Minister can share if there are plans for the University to expand more courses relating to criminology and forensic psychology studies so that our law enforcement officers can better equip themselves for the challenges ahead. We can strive to be the regional centre for such studies on terrorism and related subjects and complement the courses run by the Rajaratnam School of International Studies. I think one area of focus which I hope the curriculum would look into is how to get families to break the silence. Often, the victims suffer in silence for many years before they open up. So, there must be some training in counselling to get the victims to open up.",8,139,013-001-094-046-027-139,906
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Next is childhood education. We have been expanding fast in setting up childcare centres throughout the island. While the physical infrastructure is important, so too is the quality of the people who run these centres. These childhood educators are very important for they are planting and caring for the seeds that will eventually germinate to become the youths and the adults in our society. We must not look at childhood educators as the kindergarten teachers in the old days, in the 1950s and 1960s.",9,140,013-001-094-046-027-140,907
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Will the University or SUSS put emphasis on research in the local context? There should be more research done on childhood education so that we can have a good repository of knowledge. Understanding the mindset of the child, understanding how their young minds receive and process information, and what are best ways to help them absorb information are areas where we should look into. This should not be constrained just to childhood education, in my view, in SUSS, but also other social science subject in SUSS, including frontier studies or research on domestic, economic issues and policy implications and possible partnerships with the economic agencies in Singapore.",10,141,013-001-094-046-027-141,908
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Next, I hope some consideration can also be given for matured students, that is, those who have been teaching in childcare centres but may not have the requisite educational qualifications to meet the entry requirements.",11,142,013-001-094-046-027-142,909
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I hope as we strive for a high standard in our Universities, we will not impose too high criteria for entry to the various programmes. Yes, we want quality students but we should balance this with aptitude. It is a waste of public funds if the people who graduate do not make use of their qualifications to practise but instead take jobs unrelated to their training.",12,143,013-001-094-046-027-143,910
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Lastly, I believe in time, SUSS would be working on exchange programmes with other universities abroad so that students can also benefit from cross-fertilisation of ideas with their counterparts from other cultures. Also, it should look into getting learning attachments abroad to give students better exposure. What is happening right now is they often turn to their parents for help to get good attachments with companies abroad. The success rate, I believe, is only a small percentage.",13,144,013-001-094-046-027-144,911

2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of this Bill. The new Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS)'s focus on adult learners is important and timely. Workers will have more opportunities to broaden or deepen their knowledge. I support SUSS' move to integrate applied learning into its curriculum. This improves industry relevance. It also improves speed to market for our graduates. This is a step in the right direction. In fact, this could contribute towards the continuous need to close skills gap of our workers, an issue which was highlighted by our Manpower Minister recently.",1,146,013-001-094-046-027-146,913
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"While I welcome the move to strengthen the social sciences and to prepare students for socially-related careers, I note that four out of eight fields in SUSS' full-time programmes are business-related. These include Accountancy, Finance and Marketing. How does this fit in with the focus on Social Sciences and how will its graduates differentiate themselves from those who take similar programmes in other universities?",2,147,013-001-094-046-027-147,914
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"As SUSS is the only one of the six Universities with a stronger focus on adult learners, how would the University work with the industry to improve the employability of students? How will SUSS work with the industry, Labour Movement or WSG to ensure that students who wish to switch careers or advance their careers are given proper support, and network with employers in their field of study? Would they also similarly have structured access to internships and attachments in the industry?",3,148,013-001-094-046-027-148,915
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Press reports show overwhelming response for SUSS' courses as the number of applications received for some courses far exceed the number of places available. A report by The Straits Times also mentioned that about 62% of applicants to SUSS are Polytechnic students. I would like to know if some of the programmes will be reserved for workers, compared to fresh graduates from Polytechnics or Junior Colleges (JCs). How will the balancing be done?",4,149,013-001-094-046-027-149,916
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Finally, how can we ensure that this strong social focus does not prevent us from being nimble when industry requirements change? Right now, there is a need for more family/criminal lawyers, early childhood practitioners and specialists. But what if industry and social demands change in the future? For example, with the lower birth rates, the need for early childhood specialists may not be as high as it is now. How will SUSS ensure that its programmes are sustainable in the long term? In addition, I believe that for continued relevance and productivity, the strong social focus of the programmes must be infused by the best that digital and technological developments can offer.",5,150,013-001-094-046-027-150,917

2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Ms K Thanaletchimi (Nominated Member),"  Deputy Speaker, Sir, the restructuring and rebranding of UniSIM to SUSS to reflect its focus on social sciences are a highly commendable move. It demonstrates the increasing relevance and importance of the study of social sciences and the format of education. In a recent media interview, the hon Minister for Higher Education and Skills, Mr Ong Ye Kung, very eloquently put it, ""The name was chosen to reflect the University's mission of driving lifelong learning anchored in disciplines with a strong social focus."" I very much support this Bill which provides huge opportunities for adult learners to pursue an applied education in the social sciences.",1,167,013-001-094-046-027-167,934

However, with the shift of focus onto programmes which prepare for careers in the social sector, there will be a reduced focus and offerings in areas such as business accountancy and engineering for the adult learners. Will this reduction then be balanced or compensated by the other Universities or institutions to ensure continued opportunities for adult learners, especially when greater importance is being placed for STEM programmes which are relevant for the current and future-ready jobs?",3,169,013-001-094-046-027-169,936

As mentioned by Mr Louis Ng, many Singaporeans do welcome this change. However, the name accorded has received a mixed reaction amongst many, including the past and present SIM/UniSIM students. Those who graduated or are currently pursuing STEM, Finance or Accountancy courses/degree programmes fear that there will not be much prestige and recognition accorded for these programmes.

First, it has a strong social focus; second, applied learning; third, lifelong learning.",4,176,013-001-094-046-027-176,943

I think this is not something we need to worry about. So long as the Singapore economy remains diverse and vibrant, it will need talents of all kinds.

Let me assure the Members they will not be. The naming and the actual courses in a university is never neat. That is the reality, here as well as all over the world.

2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"And since we are on the topic of its name, let me address Ms Thanaletchimi's question about whether we can have a generic name rather than ""SUSS"" referring to Social Sciences. I went online and checked out the definition of SUSS − ""suss"" as a verb, means to realise or grasp; as a noun, it refers to knowledge and awareness of a specified kind; and, as an adjective, it means shrewd and wary. So, I think the Board of Trustees of SUSS had all these generic qualities in mind when they decided on the name, and it applies to all disciplines.",10,182,013-001-094-046-027-182,949

The issue of name is one of the hardest things to settle. The full Chinese name, as he pointed out, is “新跃社科大学”. The name is actually already registered. So, it is not so easy to change. The University went through much deliberation and decided on this name rather than ""新加坡社科大学"", which is a direct translation of SUSS.",11,183,013-001-094-046-027-183,950
2017-05-08,Singapore University of Social Sciences Bill,013-001-094-046-027,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"Why “新跃”, the first two words, is really because “新跃” was in SIM University's Chinese name for many years. I think as we restructure it, it would be good to recognise the legacy of SIM University and retain the words “新跃”. I know that a name is always subjective. Not everybody will be happy with it. But I think, for this purpose of remembering the contribution of SIM University, I seek everyone's understanding and support that we would like to keep “新跃” in the Chinese name of SUSS.",12,184,013-001-094-046-027-184,951

These are very important aspects of applied learning.",14,186,013-001-094-046-027-186,953

SUSS has already introduced around 200 of such modular courses. These programmes are created often in collaboration with industries and other organisations, or targeted at professional development in specific fields.

I agree with all his viewpoints. However, starting off as an applied University, SUSS, just like SIT, will not be a research intensive university, unlike NTU or NUS. So, in answer to Ms Denise Phua, it cannot compete in global university rankings, which are driven very much by research. Which is why the research today at applied Universities, such as SIT and SUSS, are largely done in collaboration with, or even commissioned by, companies or Government agencies. Perhaps, this is why it raised the concern and perception that we need to safeguard the autonomy of research from policymakers, a point raised by Assoc Prof Daniel Goh.",20,192,013-001-094-046-027-192,959

For these Universities, as he pointed out, the challenge sometimes is the opposite − to ensure that research is grounded and relevant to and can positively impact our communities, society and economy as well. That should also include empirical social science research relevant to Singapore. MOE will work with the AUs to take steps to encourage this.",21,193,013-001-094-046-027-193,960

To cater to the adults, SUSS has taken a holistic approach to evaluating applications, taking into account not just previous academic grades, but also career accomplishments and experience. It adopts a unique ""funnel approach"", for example, allowing adult learners who may not fully meet the academic requirements, to take three or four modules first, with admission to the rest of the undergraduate programme to be decided based on the performance in this first three or four modules.

We raised it in our manifestoes for the general elections in 2011 and 2015, and the hon Member Ms Sylvia Lim raised it in the Budget debate in 2016. The Party published a fleshed-out proposal in November last year, followed by modest public consultation exercise to gather feedback.

2017-05-08,Redundancy Insurance,013-001-094-046-029,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),The first principle is to generate risk-pooling to reduce the financial pressure on workers who are made redundant.

Nevertheless, older workers, particularly those aged 40 years and above, tend to face a triple whammy compared to younger workers. Older workers face a greater risk of being made redundant. They also face the inter-generational squeeze and have more bills to pay. Financial pressure points include children's education, support for elderly parents, as well as hefty mortgages and escalating healthcare costs. On top of these two factors, their prospects for re-employment have historically been worse than younger workers.",5,7,013-001-094-046-029-007,998

Based on the average wage excluding CPF contributions in 2014, the proposed 0.1% would amount to an average monthly contribution of $3.80 per worker. If a worker is made redundant, he or she will receive a payout of 40% of his or her last drawn salary for up to six months. This payout would be subject to a cap of 40% of the prevailing monthly median wage of resident workers. Based on the 2014 median gross monthly income of $3,000 excluding employer CPF contributions, a worker would receive up to a monthly payout of $1,200 for six months.",7,9,013-001-094-046-029-009,1000

As supplement to cash savings, the redundancy insurance payouts would give affected workers some peace of mind to look for suitable employment or to retrain and acquire new skills to make themselves relevant again in the labour market. The intention here is to minimise the distraction of financial pressures so that affected workers would do what they should be doing in such a situation  focus on getting the next job.",9,11,013-001-094-046-029-011,1002
2017-05-08,Redundancy Insurance,013-001-094-046-029,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"We should not subscribe to an either-or fallacy to downplay the usefulness of redundancy insurance. Some dismissals of redundancy insurance apply such a fallacy. Some have argued that redundancy insurance payouts would discourage workers from saving for rainy days. It is quite ridiculous to think that the maximum $7,200 payout that an affected worker stands to gain would discourage him or her from saving excess cash, especially in our thrifty culture. There is no evidence to suggest that the purchase of life insurance discourages Singaporeans from saving for their loved ones. Otherwise, why would the Government encourage lower income Singaporeans to buy life insurance by providing for life insurance relief for personal income tax?",10,12,013-001-094-046-029-012,1003
2017-05-08,Redundancy Insurance,013-001-094-046-029,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Another dismissal of redundancy insurance goes along the lines that there are already many Government programmes providing ample cash assistance to the needy. This is another either-or fallacy. Redundancy insurance payouts are not meant to replace the assistance provided to the needy. Most workers who are made redundant do not fall into the needy category and would not need cash assistance. This bears repeating. Redundancy insurance aims to reduce the financial pressure faced by affected workers and the resultant distractions caused by the pressure, so that workers can focus on getting their retraining and re-employment right.",11,13,013-001-094-046-029-013,1004

In this sense, redundancy insurance is a preventive measure, helping affected workers to avoid the vicious poverty trap and to maintain their financial independence.",12,14,013-001-094-046-029-014,1005
2017-05-08,Redundancy Insurance,013-001-094-046-029,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"The second principle of the proposed redundancy insurance scheme is to reduce insecurity and worry among the vast majority of employed Singaporeans. As the trend of more young workers getting affected by redundancies indicates, no one is safe from the risk of redundancy anymore. Technological and economic disruptions, and increasing protectionist sentiments around the globe, also mean that no industry is immune to layoffs and workforce shakeups.",13,15,013-001-094-046-029-015,1006

There is a new pattern emerging. During the financial crisis, redundancies peaked at the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first and second quarters of 2009, but quickly went back to the normal levels of 2,000-plus redundancies per quarter. In 2016, higher redundancies have become the new normal.

2017-05-08,Redundancy Insurance,013-001-094-046-029,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"The first area is skills mismatch, which has led to laid-off workers struggling to find re-employment. The net psychological effects are two-fold  increasing demoralisation among laid-off workers leading to more discouraged workers and fearful workers clinging to their jobs instead of actively seeking lifelong learning. Of course, the Government is keenly aware of this issue and has been rightly pouring resources into retraining and skills upgrading.",17,19,013-001-094-046-029-019,1010
2017-05-08,Redundancy Insurance,013-001-094-046-029,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Redundancy insurance complements these existing efforts by providing laid-off workers with breathing space to retrain and upgrade their skills to match demand in the labour market. This is preferred to laid-off workers desperately signing on to the first job they could find, which could lead to long-term underemployment and worsen skills mismatch in the wider economy.",18,20,013-001-094-046-029-020,1011
2017-05-08,Redundancy Insurance,013-001-094-046-029,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"We propose that the subsequent redundancy insurance payouts after the first payout should be tied to the condition that the worker is either actively seeking a new job through the National Jobs Bank or is actively retraining himself through the various Government programmes. This will ensure that redundancy insurance complements the national movement to improve skills and to minimise skills mismatch in the economy. This will also counter the criticism that redundancy insurance would increase unemployment rates, which is highly unlikely in our proposal in the first place as the payout is deliberately kept at a conservative level and will not be a disincentive to re-employment.",19,21,013-001-094-046-029-021,1012
2017-05-08,Redundancy Insurance,013-001-094-046-029,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"The second area is the fragmentation of employment, which refers to the changing nature of work as more workers turn to freelancing and contract for service as their primary source of income. This is something that is beginning to be felt in Singapore and Manpower Minister Lim Swee Say gave a speech on the gig economy at COS this year, in which he said that a tripartite workgroup is to study the issues faced by freelancers and to address them and to protect the well-being of freelancers with practical solutions. One of these issues is when contract workers are made redundant through the early termination of their contracts.",20,22,013-001-094-046-029-022,1013

Self-employed workers will contribute 0.1% of their self-declared income to the scheme. Self-employed individuals will receive a payout of 40% of their average last drawn income for the previous six months subject to the same median wage cap should they become unable to earn an income due to the involuntary winding up of their businesses or termination of contract for service, capped at one series of payouts every three years.",21,23,013-001-094-046-029-023,1014
2017-05-08,Redundancy Insurance,013-001-094-046-029,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"One argument against redundancy insurance is that it will inadvertently increase insecurity by making employers more willing to retrench workers or give less retrenchment benefits. But these moral hazard criticisms are only valid if employers operate in an unregulated and demoralised environment. I find it strange the idea that employers would push workers off their buildings knowing that there is a safety net below to catch the workers. This is to suggest that after so many decades of tripartite partnership, union representations and Governmental promotion of workers' rights, our moral economy of stable industrial relations is going to be undermined by a mere social insurance programme.",22,24,013-001-094-046-029-024,1015
2017-05-08,Redundancy Insurance,013-001-094-046-029,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"The third principle of the proposed redundancy insurance scheme is to complement the existing programmes under the Government's Adapt and Grow initiative. As I have mentioned repeatedly, the proposed redundancy insurance scheme does not displace or replace existing programmes to help our unemployed workers and jobseekers, but seeks to complement existing programmes. To think otherwise is to subscribe to the either-or fallacy  choose either the Workers' Party's redundancy insurance scheme or the Government's Adapt and Grow programmes. This is a false choice.",23,25,013-001-094-046-029-025,1016
2017-05-08,Redundancy Insurance,013-001-094-046-029,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Some commentators have framed the false choice as such  redundancy insurance is paid for by the workers themselves and the Adapt and Grow programmes by the Government. Of course, the latter is better. This is another either-or fallacy that encourages an entitlement mentality. It runs against this Government's oft-stated principle of fostering resilient independence among our citizens and discouraging dependence on Government welfare schemes.",24,26,013-001-094-046-029-026,1017
2017-05-08,Redundancy Insurance,013-001-094-046-029,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"In fact, I do not only see the redundancy insurance scheme as complementing Adapt and Grow. I see it as a very good candidate to become part of the Adapt and Grow suite of programmes to help Singaporean workers retrain and get re-employed. How is this so? And what gap can the redundancy insurance scheme plug?",25,27,013-001-094-046-029-027,1018
2017-05-08,Redundancy Insurance,013-001-094-046-029,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"The Adapt and Grow initiatives can provide excellent assistance for workers that are laid off. If they sign up with WSG to try out new jobs or training attachments in specific sectors, rank-and-file workers and PMETs will receive allowances from the Government. For senior PMETs who are made redundant or unemployed for six months or more, they could turn to the Career Support Programme which offers salary, training and placement support.",26,28,013-001-094-046-029-028,1019
2017-05-08,Redundancy Insurance,013-001-094-046-029,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"But these programmes work only if laid-off workers decide to turn to the Government for help in the first place. After many decades of cultivating a resilient and independent workforce, turning to the Government for immediate assistance on labour market endeavours after losing one's job is a foreign concept for Singaporean workers. In fact, it is a good thing that our workers are a resilient and independent bunch and prefer to try to look for a job on their own first before turning to the Government for help.",27,29,013-001-094-046-029-029,1020
2017-05-08,Redundancy Insurance,013-001-094-046-029,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"I do not think the Government disagrees with me on this, as the Career Support Programme policy for junior PMETs remain one of extending aid only if the workers have been unemployed for six months or more, regardless if they were made redundant. In other words, laid-off PMETs below 40 years of age are expected to seek re-employment on their own for six months before they can receive Government assistance.",28,30,013-001-094-046-029-030,1021
2017-05-08,Redundancy Insurance,013-001-094-046-029,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"This also implies that the six months after being laid off is a crucial period where the independence and resourcefulness of our workers are applied to finding a new job before the risk of discouragement starts to escalate. The labour market, when properly structured and regulated, should be left to its own devices to sort out supply and demand matching, but market failures should also be addressed, especially if market failures could lead to the discouragement of our workers. Six months seem to be the natural and reasonable period for laid-off workers to sort themselves out with the market, before they turn to the Government for assistance. But for them to do so, they need to be focused on the task and not be distracted by the strain on their finances. This is where the payouts from redundancy insurance would help.",29,31,013-001-094-046-029-031,1022
2017-05-08,Redundancy Insurance,013-001-094-046-029,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"In this sense then, the proposed redundancy insurance scheme would fit into the Adapt and Grow initiative. It provides a safety net for all laid-off workers regardless of whether they choose immediate Government assistance or not. It encourages workers to exercise their independence and resourcefulness to sort out their employment situation in the labour marketplace first, and failing which, then they can turn to Government assistance with the dignity of knowing that they have tried.",30,32,013-001-094-046-029-032,1023
2017-05-08,Redundancy Insurance,013-001-094-046-029,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Another benefit of the redundancy insurance scheme is that it cultivates a strong social consciousness among Singaporean workers, promoting a sense of solidarity among them across skills levels, income groups and generations. Even as each worker seeks to compete effectively in the labour market to maximise one's own interests and earn the remuneration one meritoriously deserve, each would also know by way of the redundancy insurance that all Singaporean workers are looking out for each other in case anyone is fell by redundancies that no one could have predicted or prevented.",31,33,013-001-094-046-029-033,1024

Many of these redundancy insurance policies share features with the one that we have proposed here.

There are differences in circumstances, which is why our proposed scheme adapts the basic features of redundancy insurance to our situation. But there are similar issues that point to the usefulness of redundancy insurance in addressing the issues. As developed economies seek to boost labour productivity and innovation amidst technological disruption, structural unemployment will rise. In such a situation, redundancy insurance is useful as a safety net for affected workers and, I must emphasise, also serves as a trampoline for workers to reskill and find new career directions.",37,39,013-001-094-046-029-039,1030

How the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) are being developed and implemented is a good example of inter-agency and stakeholder collaboration. Each ITM is led by one Government Agency, which spearheads efforts in coordinating across agencies and bringing together the different types of support available to meet the specific industry’s needs. The ITMs do not only identify strategies, they also bring together the stakeholders to jointly execute the strategies. For example, the ITM for the logistics sector was launched on 16 November 2016.

The remaining two-thirds live in other smaller accommodation types, such as Factory Converted Dormitories (FCDs), HDB Flats, and Private Residential Premises.",1,2,013-001-094-046-067-002,1251
2017-05-08,Accommodation Not Covered under Foreign Employee Dormitories Act,013-001-094-046-067,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Smaller accommodation types which are not covered under the FEDA are nonetheless still required to comply with a set of comprehensive regulations and requirements imposed by various agencies, to ensure a safe and well-maintained living space for foreign workers. They include standards for building structural safety governed by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA), fire safety governed by the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), as well as proper and adequate sanitary facilities governed by the National Environment Agency (NEA). Once all approvals have been obtained, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) will then grant the owner of the premises with permission to operate a workers’ dormitory.",2,3,013-001-094-046-067-003,1252
2017-05-08,Accommodation Not Covered under Foreign Employee Dormitories Act,013-001-094-046-067,Mr Lim Swee Say,"To ensure these accommodation are of comparable standards to larger dormitories, we take three approaches. First, the Government regularly reviews standards across all types of foreign workers’ accommodation, taking into account the unique nature of each type. Where appropriate, the minimum standards will be raised to improve the well-being of foreign workers. For example, MOM has required operators of Factory Converted Dormitories (FCDs) to comply with additional conditions from 1 January 2017, including the provision of Wi-Fi and a sickbay. The Ministry also works closely with various agencies such as NEA, URA and SCDF to conduct routine and ad-hoc inspections.",3,4,013-001-094-046-067-004,1253
2017-05-08,Accommodation Not Covered under Foreign Employee Dormitories Act,013-001-094-046-067,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Second, in addition to looking into complaints of poor housing, we also conduct proactive inspections. From 2014 to 2016, MOM conducted close to 4,000 foreign worker housing inspections. MOM ramped up our housing inspections from 700 in 2014 to 1,800 in 2016. Third, enforcement actions are taken against employers and/or dormitory operators who fail to comply with our regulations and requirements.",4,5,013-001-094-046-067-005,1254

The focus of the question is on employability because these members can qualify for the early withdrawal of their CPF savings under the MGS or claim HPS benefits if they are not able to earn an income from work due to their medical condition.",2,3,013-001-094-046-068-003,1257

For MGS, members can qualify if they have a terminal illness, a severely impaired life expectancy, or are mentally incapacitated. For HPS, members with terminal illness and total permanent disability are eligible to make claims, even though they may be working or doing some form of work.",3,4,013-001-094-046-068-004,1258
