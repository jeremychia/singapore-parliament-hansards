Our healthcare and frontline workers had been at the forefront of the battle against COVID-19.

2023-03-20,Assessment of Singapore's Long-term Inflation Expectations,014-001-095-093-002,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,asked the Prime Minister given the new normal of endemic COVID-19 and shifts in global inflation dynamics (a) whether Singapore’s long-term inflation expectations are well anchored; (b) whether there is the risk of de-anchoring of inflation returning to our long-term target in a timely manner under current challenging global macroeconomic and supply conditions; and (c) whether there is also a risk that our current estimates of long-term inflation have risen.,1,1,014-001-095-093-002-001,8
2023-03-20,Assessment of Singapore's Long-term Inflation Expectations,014-001-095-093-002,"The Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth and Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Prime Minister)","  Mr Speaker, Sir, available measures indicate that Singapore’s longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. The five-year ahead inflation forecasts of economists and professional forecasters have been broadly unchanged over the past two years. While households’ longer-term inflation expectations picked up in late 2021 to early 2022 alongside the rise in global and domestic inflation, the latest survey from December showed that expectations have fallen to close to their historical levels.",1,2,014-001-095-093-002-002,9

Year-on-year, MAS Core Inflation remained unchanged at 5.1% in Q4 2022 compared to Q3, after rising continuously since Q1 2021. On a month-on-month basis, the pace of increase in core prices has trended down over the second half of 2022.",2,3,014-001-095-093-002-003,10

These include, for instance, demographics, technological advances that impact productivity, future trends in globalisation and central banks’ commitments to ensure low and stable inflation in their economies. These factors can potentially boost or dampen inflation. There is therefore uncertainty and a significant diversity of views among central bankers, academics and analysts on the likely inflation trends in the long term.",4,5,014-001-095-093-002-005,12

2023-03-20,Assessment of Singapore's Long-term Inflation Expectations,014-001-095-093-002,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to thank the Minister of State for his answer to my question. I have two supplementary questions. My first is in regard to the assessment of the long-term inflation by MAS and the Government. How often would MAS or the Government assess the long-term inflation estimates, taking into consideration the changes in dynamics in commodity prices, global shifts and inflation dynamics?",1,8,014-001-095-093-002-008,15
2023-03-20,Assessment of Singapore's Long-term Inflation Expectations,014-001-095-093-002,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The second question is related to what has happened overnight and things that have happened in the financial sector globally. How does financial stability play a part in our exchange rate policy considerations and also long-term inflation? If the Minister of State can also briefly share about the latest developments on financial stability, given overnight happenings – what impact do those have on inflation and Singapore's financial sector as well?",2,9,014-001-095-093-002-009,16
2023-03-20,Assessment of Singapore's Long-term Inflation Expectations,014-001-095-093-002,Mr Alvin Tan,"  Sir, I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. The longer-term inflation expectations are proxied by five-year ahead forecasts for inflation, both looking at professional forecasters as well as household expectations. The household expectations survey, the DBS-SKBI SInDEx (Singapore Index of Inflation Expectations) Survey, as I mentioned, has shown that five-year ahead inflation forecasts have stabilised over the June and September surveys, and fell in the latest survey in December. So, it is a mixture of both professional forecasters as well as household expectations.",1,10,014-001-095-093-002-010,17
2023-03-20,Assessment of Singapore's Long-term Inflation Expectations,014-001-095-093-002,Mr Alvin Tan,"With regard to the Member's second supplementary question, I will frame the context in terms of how that would be impacted by or affecting longer-term inflation. As Members know, MAS' monetary policy is medium-term focused to achieve low and stable inflation as the basis for Singapore's economic growth. MAS has tightened monetary policy since October 2021 and will continue to closely monitor global and domestic economic developments in the run-up to the scheduled policy review in April 2023, where it will take into account the implications for inflation as well as growth.",2,11,014-001-095-093-002-011,18
2023-03-20,Assessment of Singapore's Long-term Inflation Expectations,014-001-095-093-002,Mr Alvin Tan,"By themselves, near-term shocks such as the recent developments in the international banking industry would not have direct implications for the long-term path of inflation and the Singapore Dollar Nominal Effective Exchange Rate or S$NEER. As I mentioned in my earlier response, these depend on longer-term structural factors such as demographics, tech advances that impact productivity as well as future trends in globalisation.",3,12,014-001-095-093-002-012,19
2023-03-20,Assessment of Singapore's Long-term Inflation Expectations,014-001-095-093-002,Mr Alvin Tan,"But as the Member also observed, there have been developments overnight and earlier this morning, and I would like to point Members to the statement that MAS had issued this morning and other statements related to developments in the international banking sector on 16 March 2023 as well as 13 March 2023.",4,13,014-001-095-093-002-013,20
2023-03-20,Assessment of Singapore's Long-term Inflation Expectations,014-001-095-093-002,Mr Alvin Tan,"Allow me to make a few quick points. First, Credit Suisse Group AG will continue operating in Singapore with no interruptions or restrictions following the announced takeover by UBS Group AG or UBS. Customers of Credit Suisse will continue to have full access to their accounts and Credit Suisse's contracts with counterparties remain in force.",5,14,014-001-095-093-002-014,21
2023-03-20,Assessment of Singapore's Long-term Inflation Expectations,014-001-095-093-002,Mr Alvin Tan,The takeover is not expected to have an impact on the stability of Singapore's banking system.,6,15,014-001-095-093-002-015,22
2023-03-20,Assessment of Singapore's Long-term Inflation Expectations,014-001-095-093-002,Mr Alvin Tan,"Second, Singapore's banking system remains sound and resilient. The Singapore dollar money market and foreign exchange market continue to function well. The Singapore banking system has insignificant exposures to the failed banks in the US. And Singapore banks have confirmed that exposure to Credit Suisse is insignificant. Banks in Singapore are well-capitalised and conduct regular stress tests against credit and other risks. Their liquidity positions are healthy, underpinned by a stable and diversified funding base.",7,16,014-001-095-093-002-016,23

2023-03-20,Assessment of Singapore's Long-term Inflation Expectations,014-001-095-093-002,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang),"  Just a quick follow-up on the question about inflation expectations. I wonder if the Minister of State can elaborate on whether MAS has observed any evidence of inflation pressures actually passing through to wages, in particular? And if so, what kind of mitigation mechanisms does the MAS have in terms of dealing with the possibility that this could become more entrenched?",1,19,014-001-095-093-002-019,26
2023-03-20,Assessment of Singapore's Long-term Inflation Expectations,014-001-095-093-002,Mr Alvin Tan,"  I think the Member for his supplementary question. As MAS has also communicated, MAS Core Inflation is expected to ease more discernably over the second half of 2023. This reflects a combination of base effects and also moderating external and domestic labour cost pressures. What does this entail? It actually suggests that longer-term inflation expectations are unlikely to persistently increase. Of course, we are looking at this and monitoring this very closely.",1,20,014-001-095-093-002-020,27
2023-03-20,Assessment of Singapore's Long-term Inflation Expectations,014-001-095-093-002,Mr Alvin Tan,"But more broadly, wages in Singapore are not tightly indexed to inflation. Over the years, our tripartite wage-setting institutions have ensured that wage outcomes remain in line with productivity growth. For these reasons, we assess that the risk of a wage price spiral remains contained at this point. But we will closely monitor developments as they go.",2,21,014-001-095-093-002-021,28

That was the real problem. And so, steps have been taken to correct this between Alba and its various other sub-contractors – those that it may appoint in place of Yok Impex. But we will certainly see the extent to which we can impart into these sub-contracts some other mechanisms that tighten the process without being overly burdensome, which then in turn increases the cost of collection.",5,30,014-001-095-093-006-030,213

I think sustainability initiatives ought to be encouraged. But my question pertains to whether Sport Singapore or MCCY made an assessment as to the conversion of sports shoes into rubber granules as being more green or more environmentally sustainable than the existing method which, as I understand also, uses this recycled tyres, for example? So, the question then is, does this initiative move the needle, or is it just a conversion of one recyclable material for another?",2,36,014-001-095-093-006-036,219
2023-03-20,Steps Taken to Ensure Recyclables Collected in Government Campaigns are Completed and Not Misused,014-001-095-093-006,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"  The short answer is yes, there was such an assessment made. And to take Mr Singh's comparison, without overly going into technical details, the rubber density of old tyres is quite different from that of the shoes that you see and the extent to which we want a certain density at the running track, on the playgrounds, they rely better and use better the materials from the shoes, rather than old tyres.",1,37,014-001-095-093-006-037,220

My understanding from people in the industry is a lot of these materials are then actually compressed together – tyres are used with rubber soles as well. Because each layer of the surface of a running track is made of different materials. I would not get into the technicalities of it, of course, but I think the principle point remains with regard to ensuring that the method that SportSG adopts is actually more green and sustainable to ensure that programmes like this succeed.",1,38,014-001-095-093-006-038,221

I have got two supplementary questions. The first is on the description of lax sorting at the downstream contractor Yok Impex. Looking at the Reuters article of 25 February 2023, I may stand corrected, but there is a phrase that says, ""none of the 11 pairs of shoes donated by Reuters were turned into exercise paths or kids' parks in Singapore”.

I cannot tell you nor can I glean from the Reuters's report where the shoes were deposited; whether they are all done at the same place or divided up into 11 different locations or otherwise. And so, I would not want to speculate as to why that is the case. The fact that the matter is that as far as the investigations show, it is only the Yok Impex collections that have been tainted with this finding based on information we have currently. So, the measures that Alba has taken in relation to Yok Impex, would in relation to the findings that we know so far be sufficient to address the problem.",2,48,014-001-095-093-006-048,231

So, in other words, spouses who have accumulated CPF funds during the marriage, at the point of divorce, it is up for division if the court feels it fit to award a spouse part or all of the CPF funds accumulated during matrimony of the other spouse. So, in that sense, an ex-spouse would already have his or her share of the CPF funds of the spouse at the point of divorce. So, it is actually not logical that most members would want the ex-spouse to have another legacy at the point of death when that spouse has already had the division of the CPF funds at the point of divorce.

Preschoolers are taught how to talk about their feelings and seek help from trusted adults when they feel unsafe or hurt. In schools, students learn about personal safety and safeguarding themselves against abuse through their Character and Citizenship Education lessons. They also learn help-seeking skills, including the ""Signal for Help"" hand gesture. They are shown the community resources and helplines for them to turn to when their safety is compromised. They are also encouraged to look out for their peers and seek help for those who display these signs of distress.",7,12,014-001-095-093-009-012,269

2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-014,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),This wrong assumption contributed to several shortcomings in our initial response.,41,42,014-001-095-093-014-042,345

2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-014,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Likewise, we started out advising the public to only wear masks when unwell. We changed this later to mandate the use of masks in public spaces, when we realised that asymptomatic transmission was possible. On hindsight, we should have been less definitive in our position on mask-wearing from the outset. We should have encouraged facial coverings of some sort, including homemade masks, while we ramped up the production of surgical masks. This would have given people psychological reassurance that they could do something to protect themselves and would also have helped to slow down transmission and spread of the virus, even though the improvised masks only provided partial protection.",44,45,014-001-095-093-014-045,348

We designed measures that took into account the risk that was inherent in different settings and activities. But we allowed the perfect to become the enemy of the good. Our rules were, at times, too finely calibrated, too complicated to follow and too difficult to implement – the varying group sizes, which I am sure everyone remembers; different rules for adults and children; different sets of rules for physical activity in different settings are some examples of this.",45,46,014-001-095-093-014-046,349

2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-014,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"One of the most difficult judgement calls we had to make was on managing our borders. Border restrictions are an important defence against the virus, but we also know that such measures only help to buy time; they cannot completely stop the virus from coming in. The question is how far do we go in tightening our borders, recognising that this will also impose a huge cost on livelihoods and on Singapore’s reliance on the world for a living.",49,50,014-001-095-093-014-050,353
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-014,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Reflecting on our experience, our sense is that at the beginning we should have built in a margin of safety and tightened border measures more aggressively the moment the virus showed signs of spreading across borders, even though there might have been some risk of us overreacting to these signals. This would have bought us time to understand the virus and build up our hospital capacity. Furthermore, having decided that we would allow Singaporeans living abroad to return home, we should have acted sooner to ramp up the provision of quarantine and isolation facilities for the returning residents.",50,51,014-001-095-093-014-051,354

2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-014,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"In particular, we took some time to resume the entry of Long-Term Pass (LTP) holders into Singapore because we had found that even with pre-departure testing, a high percentage of travellers from some countries were still testing COVID-positive on arrival. Our concern was that the large number of infected persons could easily overwhelm our isolation facilities and healthcare capacity.",52,53,014-001-095-093-014-053,356
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-014,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"It was a judgement call we had to make at that time, and not without reason. But we also know that the restrictions created significant difficulties for some groups of LTP holders, such as Employment Pass holders with families here but who were abroad, or vice versa. Some of them endured prolonged family separation and disruption to their work. Singapore did incur reputational cost and lost some goodwill from this segment of the community who also had their homes here. On reflection, we could have let the LTP Holders back in sooner, or at least prioritised entry for some groups, such as those with families here.",53,54,014-001-095-093-014-054,357
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-014,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We subsequently learnt from these experiences and adjusted our border responses when we dealt with the Omicron variant in late 2021. Members will remember we swiftly implemented a not-to-land policy to travellers from certain countries and we applied a combination of hotel and home quarantine for other travellers, depending on where they came from. The quick tightening of rules created a lot of inconvenience for those returning from their vacations then, because this was in December 2021. But it was necessary. And once we learnt more about Omicron and determined that it was less severe and not of significant concern, we eased the measures quickly as well. That was one example of how we learnt from the experiences with border restrictions.",54,55,014-001-095-093-014-055,358
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-014,The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Another example came up in December last year, when China moved away from its zero COVID-19 policy. At that time, China experienced a significant surge in cases. Several countries like the US, Japan and South Korea imposed tighter restrictions on arrivals from China. But we did not do so – and the reason is because we assessed that there were no new variants of concern detected in China, and the viral strains there were already circulating around the world and in our community. Furthermore, our arrivals from China were relatively few, and only a small proportion of them had COVID-19. We were therefore confident that the Chinese arrivals would not put too much pressure on our healthcare system and we decided at that time not to tighten restrictions. That judgement proved correct.",55,56,014-001-095-093-014-056,359

Our COVID-19 experience has been a stark reminder of our vulnerability. As a small and open economy, we were more badly hit than others by a global disruption that was outside of our control.

It seems a long time ago now, but, as early as February 2020, when the Unity Budget was announced, the Workers’ Party made clear the tone we would take on the COVID-19 crisis. We called for a unity of purpose and for politics to take a backseat. In June 2020, as we exited the circuit breaker, and a few weeks before the elections, I reiterated in my speech on the Fortitude Budget, that the Workers’ Party did not come in to publicly criticise the Government on its handling of an unprecedented crisis. We were determined to support, and not undermine, the national effort.",25,126,014-001-095-093-014-126,429

However, there are many outside this House who played an equal part in saving livelihoods. As COVID-19 brought our economy to a near halt, many individuals saw their incomes evaporate. I will never forget my engagement with a group of private-hire bus drivers at the start of COVID-19. These drivers had mouths to feed and vehicle loans to repay, but no business to generate income. Their worries, and even fears, were palpable. These drivers, and others like them, were helped by the diligence of public officers who engaged with financial institutions to withhold the repossession of vehicles. I wish to restate my acknowledgement of these efforts.",29,130,014-001-095-093-014-130,433

Many workers lost their jobs and income. The workers in the aviation, aerospace and tourism sectors were especially affected when the borders closed. Our self-employed persons (SEPs) were hit especially hard by the sudden loss of income during the circuit breaker.

I was in both of the NWCs. I witnessed how unity prevailed where we could have succumbed easily to self-interests. NTUC worked with our tripartite partners and recommended reducing non-wage costs and guided businesses to manage excess manpower to save jobs.

NTUC developed the Job Security Council (JSC) in 2020 to achieve this. Managed by NTUC’s e2i, it is a placement ecosystem with a network of employers that are hiring and releasing workers. At its core, the JSC aims to support businesses in coping with fluctuating manpower needs across the economic cycle while providing support to workers in need. In particular, JSC focused on engaging with at-risk or displaced workers to pre-emptively shorten the unemployment period by helping them find jobs.

For example, during the circuit breaker, taxi drivers and private hire drivers saw their income dropped rapidly. Sports coaches, art instructors and tour guides saw their income dropped nearly to zero or zero, during the lockdown. Unlike the employees with their companies receiving support from the Government, SEPs were not afforded such support. The mechanism used to provide support to the employees just could not work for them. The Labour Movement quickly took up their cause with the Government. The Government responded strongly with the Self-Employed Income Relief Scheme (SIRS).",19,154,014-001-095-093-014-154,457
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-014,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"With the Government stretched immeasurably on many different fronts, the Labour Movement had to stepped up to administer SIRS. We needed to implement SIRS quickly. The circuit breaker would leave almost all of our SEPs with no income. Our priority was to get these monies into the affected SEPs' hands as soon as possible, to provide them with a lifeline during such unprecedented times. Because a sizeable proportion of our SEPs had not previously filed their income, it was operationally challenging to swiftly identify SEPs in need. With the very short lead time, the bulk of the processing of the SIRS had to be done manually. Application systems and forms had to be fine-tuned several times to better serve our SEPs. We also recognised that some of our older ones struggled with navigating online forms and faced difficulties in collating the requisite documentation. NTUC staff stepped up and helped members through every step of the process. The scheme was able to help some 200,000 SEPs to obtain $9,000 to tide through the pandemic.",20,155,014-001-095-093-014-155,458
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-014,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"The Labour Movement's involvement in implementing SIRS provided us with valuable lessons. The greatest of which was the precarious financial situations faced by many SEPs, especially the lower income ones. We need to strengthen their financial and career resilience for SEPs. This is especially when the next Pandemic is inevitable. We need to support SEPs to improve their career resilience and flexibility, through training to deepen their skills and diversify their work portfolios. During periods of business or income disruptions, SEPs also need access to short-term income support. I call upon the Government to look into developing such support which can be tied to their efforts to train and search for jobs.",21,156,014-001-095-093-014-156,459

The salaries of nurses in other jurisdictions like Australia, Hong Kong and Canada should also be considered in the benchmarking.",12,173,014-001-095-093-014-173,476

This is to ensure that the opportunity cost of taking up nursing instead of another profession would be minimised. We also need to make the nursing profession more highly esteemed by the general public.,13,174,014-001-095-093-014-174,477
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-014,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"Another way to attract more Singaporeans to take up nursing and increase retention would be to enhance their professional development opportunities. Nurses in Singapore are often still seen as the assistants to doctors instead of being professionals in their own right. They should instead be granted more autonomy and entrusted with higher level responsibilities. In the United Kingdom, nurses run clinics, diagnose patients, take on high-level management roles and help to lead medical research. We should accelerate efforts to achieve the target of 700 Advance Practice Nurses by 2030.",14,175,014-001-095-093-014-175,478

Many wheelchair users and people with developmental disabilities, visual impairments and autism spectrum disorder had difficulties with SafeEntry scanning. Measures such as COVID-19 swabbing and mask-wearing were difficult for some people.

This could be due to an absence of meaningful participation by PwDs when safe management measures were implemented. Moving forward, it would be advisable to have at least one member of the disability community on emergency task forces so that the community's views can be adequately represented. More importantly, all policies rolled out need to take into account the unique needs of PwDs, to ensure that they are not excluded.",17,178,014-001-095-093-014-178,481

Only in Singapore, Hungary, Israel and Sweden does the majority feel the opposite, that the way their country has handled the COVID-19 virus outbreak highlights their country's political strengths.

JSS was critical in keeping most businesses afloat during the pandemic and preserving jobs for workers by providing wage support for the companies to retain employees. To quote Mr Farid Khan, President of the Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry  ""The swift action taken by the Government in implementing this scheme has undoubtedly saved jobs and businesses."" In parallel, businesses, especially SMEs, are grateful to the Government for the quick rollout of the temporary relief measures, including rental rebates, bridging loan programmes, deferment of loan repayments, access to credit and so on. All these measures, which were urgently needed, were passed into legislation in record time. Looking back, Mr Kurt Wee, President of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME), said  ""COVID-19 brought unprecedented collaboration and cooperation between SMEs and Government. Coordination with ESG was almost on a daily basis, at times, with two to three advisories being disseminated to the business ecosystem. TACs played a critical information bridge hand-in-hand with Government to usher the whole ecosystem throughout the crisis. Strong levels of trust were established.

Given that, in general, 90% of hotel business comes from international travel, with the closure of our borders and subsequent border restriction measures, this industry was severely impacted. I would like to quote Ms Kwee Wei Lin, President of the Singapore Hotel Association  ""Hotels are thankful to the Government for lifelines, such as the Jobs Support Scheme, which had helped to protect the livelihoods of our local employees. This, in turn, ensured that the industry had talents to restart effectively when recovery eventually came. Additionally, the rollout of the Enhanced Training Support package by the Government worked really well for the industry as hotels could optimise the downtime to upskill and reskill their employees to cater to a post-COVID-19 tourism landscape. Additionally, the launch of STB's Singapore Rediscover vouchers in December 2020 was another scheme which helped hotels to keep the lights on and retain its local workforce. The SHA would like to record its appreciation to the Government for helping the industry stay resilient.

Ms Kwee shared how all the hotels stepped forward swiftly to repurpose their properties into isolation facilities to help our nation fight against COVID-19. Isolation, quarantine and SHN was an important line of defence against the pandemic and, at one point, more than half of the 67,000 hotel rooms in Singapore at that time were used in our battle against COVID-19. I am sure all of us in this Chamber will join the SHA to express our gratitude to all hotel employees, especially the frontliners, who very quickly adapted to their service delivery to offer compassion and care to guests who had to undergo isolation, quarantine or SHN.

The President of Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore (REDAS), Mr Chia Ngiang Hong, recalled the chaotic condition at the beginning of COVID-19 breakout due to the lack of direction and coordination among the various Government agencies. I quote Mr Chia Ngiang Hong  ""We agree with the finding in the White Paper that the handling of migrant workers was rather disappointing. As migrant workers are a lifeline to the construction industry, the impact to the industry and consequences were quite significant, as evidenced by the long delays in many construction projects and the collapse of a few big contractors. The reopening of worksites after the stabilisation of the migrant worker situation was rather painful, with volumes of new rules and requirements resulting in painfully slow progress on sites. Fortunately, Minister Desmond Lee stepped in to personally supervise the situation. With his very regular meetings with relevant stakeholders and agencies and very frank exchanges of views and feedback, the situation recovered well and inched towards normalcy. On hindsight, much could have been done differently by everyone, and the White Paper was objective and frank in calling out the issues and the lessons learnt.""",11,253,014-001-095-093-014-253,556

In partnership with MOM, the SBF foundation, with the support of our SBF members, set up MigrantWell, an IPC charity, to establish one of the centres, St Andrew's Migrant Worker Medical Centre, at Penjuru. MigrantWell is also providing care gaps, for example, dental care for pain management, rehab physiotherapy and mental wellness for our migrant workers.

These are people who are here in Singapore to earn an honest living to support their families back home.

During COVID-19, amongst the heroes of our frontline workers include our 21,000 public transport workers. Notwithstanding that I am involved with the Public Transport Council, I submit to you that our public transport workers, as do our healthcare workers and all the other frontline workers, deserve our heartfelt appreciation. LTA and the public transport operators kept our buses and trains running so that our healthcare workers and essential work force can get to where they need to get to, to save lives, to connect Singaporeans to their families even during the phases when it was only two per household allowed, to keep Singapore humming in spite of the pandemic. At the peak of the pandemic, average daily ridership dropped to less than 25% of pre-COVID-19, but it was decided that public transport must be kept available for our essential workers and bus and MRT train service levels were sustained at largely pre-COVID-19 frequencies.",14,256,014-001-095-093-014-256,559

We salute them for that. When Malaysia announced closing of borders, our public transport operators (PTOs) worked around the clock to find accommodation to house our Malaysian bus captains and engineers. When the vaccination programme was launched, our public transport workers were given priority access to vaccines. And when there were concerns with the mental well-being of the public transport workers, especially the foreign workforce having to be away from their family and loved ones for prolonged periods, the PTOs leaned in.

He said, and I quote  ""Singapore did a great job at handling the difficult situation during COVID-19.

Are we identifying the acupressure points, the points whereby if the supply chain comes under stress, there is disproportionate impact? Are we searching for the shatter points – the vulnerable points in our supply chains, so that we can strengthen, defend and protect ourselves better in a crisis?

For example, $30 billion was distributed to businesses in wage support. As this was a broad-based measure, even companies that continued to be highly profitable throughout the pandemic were included. It is difficult to understand why companies who can afford to continue paying millions of dollars in executive pay should be receiving wage support from taxpayers. Thirty billion dollars is a big amount and equivalent to a GST collection of 17%. The Deputy Prime Minister has told us that the $40 billion draw from our past reserves is unlikely to be paid back. I think greater scrutiny is merited on whether we had spent our reserves prudently.",4,323,014-001-095-093-014-323,626

Companies that remained profitable throughout the pandemic, those that turned profitable after the crisis and those who paid excessive executive remuneration should return the grants given.

This is a point I have raised before in an Adjournment Motion in January 2022. I urge the Government to look into the circumstances of those who had lost their jobs due to their unvaccinated status. They have paid a heavier price than average in the country's efforts to get the pandemic under control and I think special consideration in the form of employment assistance and financial compensation is in order.",12,331,014-001-095-093-014-331,634

2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-014,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"No doubt, at the time, it may have been problematic for GPs to have played more of a role in this effort, at least at the initial stage, due to the very slender staffing and administrative resources that most GPs have. But given the enhancements to the role of GPs that will come about due to Healthier SG, which should see GPs enhance their access to IT and data, for example, I wonder if, in case there is a future pandemic, could GPs play more of a role in the initial response, in terms of vaccination and surveillance?",7,408,014-001-095-093-014-408,711

And I quote from the White Paper  ""In retrospect, the early precautions we took in the dormitories were insufficient. Given the communal living environment, the dormitory outbreak had every possibility of becoming a major disaster. We should have probed deeper and conducted better and earlier ground surveillance, such as by doing dipstick testing on sample populations to make the most of limited testing resources. We also had to make a difficult judgement call on when and how to relax movement restrictions on migrant workers living in dormitories. We could have eased some of the restrictions earlier, especially after most of the workers had been vaccinated and boosted… In the end, we decided to act with an abundance of caution to keep the workers and the broader community safe. But the extended restrictions did take a toll on their well-being.""",16,417,014-001-095-093-014-417,720

2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-014,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Next, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on the role of non-governmental organisations (NGOs). I spoke of the migrant worker NGOs who played such a valuable role in the COVID-19 crisis. A more general point I would like to make here is that in future pandemics, there can be a stronger role for NGOs as partners, working with the Government to execute initiatives, but also to inform and critique policies and decision-making, and to disseminate accurate information to their communities.",30,431,014-001-095-093-014-431,734

2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-014,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"If a future pandemic or other national crisis happens, I hope the Government can assign a more institutional capacity to involving NGOs who are close to their various constituents on the ground, not only in executing projects but also in formulating and refining policy approaches and in making decisions. I had earlier referred to the pertinent advice that TWC2 had publicly aired back in March 2020, and I believe earlier as well, which we would have done well to heed at that point.",32,433,014-001-095-093-014-433,736
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-014,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"One area where NGOs could play an important role is mental health – something my colleague, Sengkang Member of Parliament Ms He Ting Ru referred to. The COVID-19 pandemic took a heavy toll on the mental health of many Singaporeans and people around the world. Due to the general fear and anxiety level, the economic devastation felt by some groups of people even as others prospered, and having to work from home and learn from home for prolonged periods.",33,434,014-001-095-093-014-434,737

2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-014,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"One area also where we can boost our mental health care capacity for future crises is in terms of our population of psychologists. In reply to a Parliamentary Question from Sengkang Member of Parliament, Ms He Ting Ru, the Government revealed that our number of psychologists per 100,000 of our population is 9.7. This compares to around 30 in the US and 49 in Canada and France, for example. The same ratio for psychiatrists places Singapore under five, versus for example 15 for Canada and 24 for Finland.",36,437,014-001-095-093-014-437,740
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-014,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Government scholarships are one tool to increase the number of trained psychologists in the public sector. Training to be a clinical psychologist takes as long as that for medical doctors. Currently, the Healthcare Graduate Studies Award is open to post-graduate courses for Clinical Psychology as one of the 10 other courses of study, such as Audiology, Health Economics and Epidemiology. By contrast, the PSC Scholarship for Medicine and Dentistry targets applications for study only in Medicine and Dentistry. So, the number of post-grad scholarships dedicated to clinical psychology is probably not as high as for medicine and dentistry and there is no clearly targeted number for clinical psychology alone, for the reasons I explained. This should be addressed.",37,438,014-001-095-093-014-438,741

2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-014,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"The White Paper appears to be a public communication document. In terms of format, evidence of academic and analytic rigour as well as granularity of detail, it stands in stark contrast to a different paper that was published in 2010 by academics on Singapore’s H1N1 pandemic response. That paper was entitled “Influenza A (H1N1-2009) Pandemic in Singapore – Public Health Control Measures Implemented and Lessons Learnt.” The authors were academics Joanne Tay, Ng Yuek Fan, Jeffrey Cutter and Lyn James. No doubt that was an academic paper rather than a Government White Paper, but that paper seems at the very least more detailed and, if I may, more clinical in how it marshals facts and uses them to build conclusions. That paper was also authored by independent academics who drew on interviews with MOH and other officials but did not represent the views of MOH. And it has a much fuller methodological note.",39,440,014-001-095-093-014-440,743

This would serve the purpose of greater transparency and a fuller and better-informed public debate on what should be the lessons we learn.",40,441,014-001-095-093-014-441,744

The White Paper highlighted the shortage of masks that we had to contend with. Given our domestic constraints, both labour as well as costs, as well as our shift towards more high-value-adding advance manufacturing, producing medical masks domestically may not be economically viable. It is difficult to compete with countries with a much lower cost structure.",27,153,014-001-095-093-016-153,961

2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-016,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"In an ironic way, thanks to the transboundary haze situation that we faced years ago, the Government does stockpile a significant quantity of masks, which helped us meet the initial wave of demand when the outbreak happened. But the stockpile quantity was never able to meet that sort of daily consumption demand needed for the entire population in a long-drawn pandemic.",29,155,014-001-095-093-016-155,963

2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-016,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"However, for the production to be viable, it would require some domestic anchor orders or offtake from the Government so that there is a base level production volume to work with – very much like how PUB undertook the liability to buy a certain quantity of desalinated water from water production companies even though it cost more than treated water.",32,158,014-001-095-093-016-158,966

My suggestions notwithstanding, Sir, I support the Motion.",21,127,014-001-095-093-019-127,1126

2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"   Sir, first, let me declare my interest as Group CEO of NTUC Enterprise. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is important to remember lessons when they are fresh and I, therefore, congratulate the Government for its decision to write and to publish this White Paper, because it records our successes, our mistakes, our missteps, as well as the justifications of our key decisions.",1,129,014-001-095-093-019-129,1128
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"In leadership of human affairs, there is no do-over – there is only one chance to get it right. And this is why it is so important that when we get it wrong, we make sure that it happens only once and we do it better the next time. That is not to say that we will not make mistakes but let us make new ones and not repeat the ones of history. Only in this way can Singapore progress and emerge stronger from each crisis.",2,130,014-001-095-093-019-130,1129
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"That Singapore had weathered the storm is unmistakable, but the reasons we did so may be less clear.",3,131,014-001-095-093-019-131,1130
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"I count at least three, the third of which is often overlooked  first, our people; second, our money; and third, sheer luck. We should not discount the role of luck, for only by acknowledging the role of luck can we keep ourselves from hubris and from under-estimating the complexity, the ambiguity and the extraordinariness of future events.",4,132,014-001-095-093-019-132,1131
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"The White Paper holds many useful operational lessons that I am sure will stand us in good stead in time to come. The most valuable lesson to me, however, is a reminder of the importance of the human dimension.",5,133,014-001-095-093-019-133,1132
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Here, I want to pay tribute to all essential and frontline workers – from cleaners to delivery workers to those working in healthcare, transport, education, social work, and yes, also supermarkets – many of whom had toiled for many years and mostly taken for granted by all of us. I hope also that our appreciation to this group of workers does not subside now that this pandemic is over and that we are back to DORSCON Green.",6,134,014-001-095-093-019-134,1133
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Indeed, the pandemic showed how important, how underrated, and how under-appreciated they were, and how we need an overhaul of the way we organise our world – from wages to social and economic structures, from the way we live, to the way we allocate resources. It is now a time to see that while praise and awards are good, equitable pay and respect for each other, for work, are better.",7,135,014-001-095-093-019-135,1134
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"One of my proudest moments was in the way we reacted in the early days of the pandemic – how we offered free healthcare to anyone struck by COVID-19, regardless of race, nationality or means; how, being one of the first countries to obtain the vaccine, we prioritised according to need, offering the earliest doses to the elderly and the migrant workers living in dense quarters.",8,136,014-001-095-093-019-136,1135
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"I was also proud of the way we opened our hearts and our doors to the migrant workers. It was a mistake not to have anticipated the intensity of the outbreak in the dormitories – it meant that nearly half of the 300,000 workers living in dormitories had been infected by 2020. Sadly, two workers died.",9,137,014-001-095-093-019-137,1136
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"At the same time, there were many, many in the community who jumped in to help. I cite one example of NUS who opened their hostels to migrant workers, housing hundreds of them within the halls of residence.",10,138,014-001-095-093-019-138,1137
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Students were briefed about the COVID-19 situation in the workers' dormitories and why they needed to share their hostels. Rather than fear of infection and resistance to strangers living in their midst, the students worked to make the workers feel welcome. Sports teams conducted online morning personal training (PT) every day – just like our National Service (NS) times. Others held classes to teach them about financial scams. Still others recorded video messages to show their support.",11,139,014-001-095-093-019-139,1138
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"The human touch was abundantly evident. When doctors working on the ground at the dormitories called for volunteer translators, students from different countries – India, China, Myanmar, Thailand – they all took turns to translate these instructions. When the workers finished their stay at the hostels, they were treated to a ""graduation"" ceremony, where they took photos with the university mascots.",12,140,014-001-095-093-019-140,1139
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"In a real way, I feel our students graduated too – and from a far higher-ranked university than NUS.",13,141,014-001-095-093-019-141,1140
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"I also want to reflect on our darker moments. It was indeed confusing when we changed course and took both too much and too little risk. Our safe distancing measures – gathering in groups of two, five, eight, and then back to two – these were a reflection of the dynamic nature of the pandemic. Reality was fast moving and so too was our response.",14,142,014-001-095-093-019-142,1141
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"The key was to explain and communicate, continuously and quickly. We may not have always succeeded but the high trust that we had in each other was a key reason we managed some degree of calm and order. The people trusted that we were doing our best as a Government and the Government trusted that people were doing their best to follow fast-changing rules and guidelines. The business community also played their part and the whole Singaporean community also played their part – all came together, and together, we reaped the returns of the trust, the faith that we had built over the years.",15,143,014-001-095-093-019-143,1142
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Indeed, during the day when DORSCON Orange was declared, when Malaysia announced their Movement Control Order and when we announced our circuit breaker, these were pivotal moments where our trust and our faith and our bonds – these were tested in full force.",16,144,014-001-095-093-019-144,1143
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Wearing my NTUC Fairprice hat at that time, and working with the Government and the media, we had to assuage genuine fears and anxieties of the general public, amongst many messages, that supermarkets will remain open; that stocks are available; and if they were not, they were on the way. And at the same time, seeking understanding and support of the public to only buy what they need and not create their own stockpiles.",17,145,014-001-095-093-019-145,1144
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Despite best efforts on both sides, however, there were times of genuine confusion, not to say fear or anger, over the application of the rules to eating places, coffee shops, which caused a lot of confusion and sometimes, disputes. Businesses were quite badly affected too. I know, as our NTUC FoodFare and our Kopitiam chains were also caught in this spiral.",18,146,014-001-095-093-019-146,1145
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"I did raise these issues at the time, but when emotions, when fear, when uncertainty ran high, and in the trade-off between lives and livelihoods, one would swing on the side of conservatism and safety. We made the right call to be cautious, but we must also be aware of the costs incurred.",19,147,014-001-095-093-019-147,1146
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"In a pandemic, no amount of reassurance and communications can eradicate the fear and anxiety we face. At the same time, we need a healthy dose of agnosticism in the face of so much that we do not know – we recognise that our injunction against mask wearing was over-done. It was hubris to think we knew what was unknowable, at that time.",20,148,014-001-095-093-019-148,1147
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"And here, I want to acknowledge that it was plain good luck that we were not hit by a deep and severe spread during the ""no need for masks"" early days, and that when COVID-19 hit us in full force later on, we already had our masks and we had our sanitisers.",21,149,014-001-095-093-019-149,1148
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"However, it was not luck that allowed us to restock our supermarket shelves overnight. After the onslaught of panic buying, it was not luck that enabled the Government to inject money into our system without borrowing. It was also not luck that we got supplies of drugs, food and vaccines – for a country that imports 90% of our food, we never once went hungry.",22,150,014-001-095-093-019-150,1149
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"All these were possible because of, you could say, plain, boring, virtues – very Singaporean things, like long-term planning, careful husbandry of reserves, technocratic, technical and engineering capabilities during decades of peace and prosperity, hoarded for this one-time use.",23,151,014-001-095-093-019-151,1150
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"This is not just the domain of Government. There are many other partners in the community who spent their reserves too. NTUC was one among many which did our part. In 2020, the NTUC Enterprise group of social enterprises rolled out a $50-million package to provide holistic support for Singaporeans to cope with the pandemic. In the following year, another $20 million was committed to help the community tide over the second year of the pandemic.",24,152,014-001-095-093-019-152,1151
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"These initiatives have benefited the community by providing support to frontline workers, ensuring the public's access to affordable essential goods and services, providing financial assistance to vulnerable groups, and supporting small businesses that have been affected by the pandemic, and also through our foundations, providing more support to the vulnerable groups, the Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) and charities.",25,153,014-001-095-093-019-153,1152
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),The work has certainly not ended because our world will never be the same.,26,154,014-001-095-093-019-154,1153
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Let me give you a boring example in logistics. During this COVID-19 period, NTUC Fairprice expanded our warehouse capabilities to support additional storage requirements. During COVID-19, we had to adapt, and we successfully set up an alternative warehouse. We did this within five days. We converted a brick-and-mortar store to an online fulfilment centre within three weeks, again to meet the surge in online orders.",27,155,014-001-095-093-019-155,1154
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"By 2021, FairPrice had set up what we called a Supply Chain Ops Centre (SCope). This was to enhance our supply chain capabilities and to ensure we remain operational regardless of disruptions. More importantly, this ops centre allows us to minimise out-of-stock scenarios because it functions as an early warning system.",28,156,014-001-095-093-019-156,1155
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"In fact, when the Suez Canal blockage incident happened in March 2021, Fairprice was before the international agencies reported on the news. This incident had affected a few vessels that were transporting some of the supplies and products that we had ordered. The near real-time alert had bought us precious time to execute our contingency plans, thus avoiding supply chain disruptions.",29,157,014-001-095-093-019-157,1156
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"Today, we are more agile. We have further diversified our sources of supply, covering over 100 countries and we are constantly looking to strengthen our network of suppliers to avoid any over-reliance on any one source. So, whilst, yes, we still carry a lot of eggs from Malaysia, we also have eggs from Australia, New Zealand, as well as, certainly, from our local farms. And over this COVID-19 period, we have added Spain, Ukraine and Poland as additional sources for eggs. And just last month, we added Brunei to the list of countries supplying eggs to us.",30,158,014-001-095-093-019-158,1157
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"The way we feed ourselves will not be the same. The way we live, the way we work, will also be different – telemedicine, work from home, online learning, the need for insurance. But there are other things which will remain the same – resilience, unity, and a single-minded commitment to our joint future. These are enduring virtues that have always been part of our DNA as a young country formed of hungry migrants.",31,159,014-001-095-093-019-159,1158
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"I said at the start that the most important lesson in the White Paper is of the human dimension. It is a lesson of the mind and one that is difficult to record in a document, a lesson that cannot be taught but must be learnt.",32,160,014-001-095-093-019-160,1159
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade),"We must see that our brightest moments in the whole pandemic came from the times when we recognised, and when we respected our common humanity, and that our society is one which has an equality of respect and dignity for each one of us. We must learn, we must remember this lesson, because it is one, that as Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong had said, will test us again. Sir, I support the Motion.",33,161,014-001-095-093-019-161,1160

2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"  Mr Speaker, Sir, this Motion on Singapore's Response to COVID-19 and the recently released White Paper is a welcome first step to boost Singapore's capacity to weather not just the next pandemic, but other unforeseeable disruptions in future as well. It charts the broad directions that we need to head in to enhance our resilience as a small country that is susceptible to global or regional shocks.",1,163,014-001-095-093-019-163,1162
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"I will focus my speech on the more general thrust of how we should enhance Singapore's resilience as a nation. I will address how we can better prepare to prevent or manage significant disruptions to our way of life in four parts – in resources, infrastructure, manpower and mindsets.",2,164,014-001-095-093-019-164,1163
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"First, on resources. Early on in the pandemic, we saw how other countries implemented nationalistic and protectionist policies to restrict the export of essential medical supplies like medical-grade face masks, as demand spiked locally. Being an import-dependent economy, Singapore initially suffered difficulties in securing critical medical supplies.",3,165,014-001-095-093-019-165,1164
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Also in early 2020, many countries, including Singapore, saw panic buying and hoarding of essential supplies amidst the uncertainty and the prospect of having to be confined at home. In Singapore, we did well to keep supplies flowing and assuage Singaporeans of our sufficiency. In reviewing our stockpiling strategies, I hope the Government will make the revised comprehensive list of critical items known to the public. As Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong mentioned, I was glad to hear that there will be a fore-planning team and department that will be set up for future crises. The essential thing is whether we can determine what is the level of redundancy we need for each resource. While some of this information would concern national security, a limited disclosure to the public would reassure Singaporeans that we are disruption-ready.",4,166,014-001-095-093-019-166,1165
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"There will, inevitably, be an additional cost as we build buffers and diversify our supply chains. Importantly, have we calculated how much more we are willing to pay for such ""insurance"", as compared to buying ""just enough"" and from the cheapest source? Moreover, does this mean that our Government procurement guidelines need to be amended to facilitate this aim, or do the existing value-for-money metrics accommodate this objective to ""insure"" ourselves against unknown shocks?",5,167,014-001-095-093-019-167,1166
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Finally, as we invest in boosting our local production capacity, our natural constraints mean that we will still have some reliance on foreign sources to augment our domestic solutions. Many Singaporeans may not know this. But we have Singapore-based PUB officers constantly stationed at the Johor River Waterworks (JRWW) in Kota Tinggi, Malaysia, to ensure the smooth supply of imported water into Singapore. So, yes, we have a group of Singaporeans who are working in Kota Tinggi on a daily basis.",6,168,014-001-095-093-019-168,1167
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"While these officers commuted daily across the Causeway pre-COVID-19, many of them had to make personal sacrifices and spent up to one month per shift away from their families when the pandemic-related travel restrictions were in force. They, like many others, are the unsung heroes in our fight against COVID-19 and we are all deeply grateful, and to their families, too.",7,169,014-001-095-093-019-169,1168
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Second, on infrastructure. The collaboration between our public and private sectors enabled large-scale care facilities to be mobilised and demobilised at speed during the pandemic. This helped to manage the stress on our permanent healthcare facilities as the number of cases peaked and ebbed. I look forward to hearing more concrete plans on how the Government intends to design its facilities to be multi-use and redeployable into accommodation, medical and other critical facilities during a crisis.",8,170,014-001-095-093-019-170,1169
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"However, I am also concerned about more bespoke infrastructure for which substitutes are not readily available. For example, Members may remember the publicised COVID-19 cluster outbreaks at the Jurong Fishery Port (JFP) in July 2021 and Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre (PPWC) in September 2021. As these are key nodes for the distribution of seafood, fruits and vegetables to our supermarkets, wet markets and hawker centres, it was unsurprising that these outbreaks grew to become one of Singapore's biggest community clusters with more than 1,000 linked cases. The PPWC had to close and cease operations for three days. In Toa Payoh East, for example, at the Toa Payoh East Lorong 7 wholesale night market in my constituency, they were similarly affected and closed voluntarily for two weeks after COVID-19 cases were discovered.",9,171,014-001-095-093-019-171,1170
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Sir, I would like to commend the National Environment Agency (NEA), Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and EnterpriseSG for responding quickly to manage the virus spread and help traders activate alternative supply arrangements. And they have done so in Toa Payoh East, too. Going forward, we may need to look at our preventive strategy to manage disruptions at such bespoke hubs and assess if there is sufficient capacity at alternate distribution ports and centres to handle contingencies that cripple a particular distribution centre.",10,172,014-001-095-093-019-172,1171
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Third, on manpower, Mr Speaker. A big plus that did not seem to be highlighted adequately in the White Paper is how we managed to effectively redeploy manpower to where it is needed. One example would be how around 3,000 Safe Distancing Ambassadors and enforcement officers were deployed and coordinated by the Ministry of Sustainability and Environment (MSE) to ensure compliance with safe management measures (SMMs) and vaccination-differentiated SMMs in public spaces.",11,173,014-001-095-093-019-173,1172
2023-03-20,Singapore's COVID-19 Response,014-001-095-093-019,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"When commercial flights were suspended during the height of the pandemic, the Public Service Division quickly worked with the private sector to redeploy aviation workers to fill urgent manpower needs in both public healthcare institutions and public agencies.

While it should remain Singapore's strength to remain open to the world even in trying times, the prolonged pandemic has seen expatriates and migrant workers return home to be with their families with no certainty of return.

From Malay/Muslim frontline workers such as doctors, nurses, social workers, delivery riders, safe distance ambassadors and all those who worked day and night, including members of the Cabinet and ministry staff who drafted policies, regulatory amendments and budgetary measures quickly to deal with the COVID-19 crisis at its peak, I would like to take this opportunity to say thank you.",17,179,014-001-095-093-019-179,1178

Muis and the Office of the Mufti provided clear direction in line with Islamic teachings during those tough times as we had to scale back on physical attendance to congregational prayers and other important religious practices. Provisions were specially made for vulnerable groups, reminding all of us of the need to protect the well-being of our community while performing our religious duties. The use of digital technology is a good measure implemented for prayer sessions and congregational prayer slots in mosques which was done quickly and was well-coordinated.",18,180,014-001-095-093-019-180,1179

The taskforce, with the support of our social workers and religious teachers, came up with a psycho-social resilience framework to nurture a new norm of a resilient self, family and community, and set up a Care Network and interactive e-forum to help everyone affected cope with the disruptions to their daily lives.

This is all, in part, down to the efforts of NEA and SFA to reach out to stallholders during the pandemic. These intensive outreach efforts had also helped to achieve a 99.9% vaccination rate across hawker centres, wet markets and coffee shops and to implement the rostered routine testing regime to test thousands of hawkers and workers, which allowed our hawker centres, wet markets and coffee shops to maintain operations and serve the local communities. This rostered routine testing at the covered plaza in Toa Payoh East and Lorong 8 Toa Payoh, has played a part to reassure safety to residents and hawker patrons in those markets.

From the examples that I shared, there is also a need for channels of effective two-way communications and engagement for support and help when individual situations required it. The White Paper rightly outlined that we should have directed more resources to frontline crisis communication especially at case management and the need for tight information flow between the various stakeholders.

I have personally observed how COVID-19 affected hawkers and stall owners. I must share that the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) played a critical role in coordinating and implementing safe management measures (SMMs) and vaccination-differentiated safe management measures (VDS) in public spaces. At the height of the pandemic, over 3,000 Safe Distancing Ambassadors (SDAs) and Enforcement Officers (EOs) were deployed daily at public areas such as malls, parks, hawker centres, and coffee shops to ensure compliance with SMMs and VDS. In addition, there are over 114 hawker centres and wet markets and over 1,200 coffee shops. This is no mean feat.",15,235,014-001-095-093-019-235,1234

No one went out of business. This was because MSE officers had a close working relationship with the hawker and market stall holders. There was deep trust in their working relationship.

One of these RRT centres were actually just behind the 505 market in Jurong Spring.

But the impact was quickly mitigated with the swift and professional response by the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI).

Compliance with Safe Management Measures guidelines was essential and it became everyone's responsibility to practice basic hygiene for the greater good. Additionally, when the guidelines changed during the pandemic, such as group size, distancing and mask wearing, we trusted the view of experts and adapted quickly. At work, new requirements were implemented due to the pandemic. Staff had to be split into two teams to minimise contact between employees. In factories, even during breaks, workers had to be separated from one another.

From giving words of encouragement to driving them home from the hospital for free, the COVID-19 crisis has shown our ability to come together and help each other in critical times.",27,275,014-001-095-093-019-275,1274

2023-03-20,Protecting Our Marine Spaces and Southern Islands,014-001-095-093-021,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),The second reason our marine ecosystems are important is climate change.

She tells me, “I envision a future where we can all work hand in hand to create spaces where wildlife can co-exist with humans. Together with our research, conservation and community initiatives, we can better safeguard our native biodiversity and keep our ecosystems healthy with more legislation, funding support and long-term partnership from the Government.”",22,24,014-001-095-093-021-024,1319
2023-03-20,Protecting Our Marine Spaces and Southern Islands,014-001-095-093-021,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The second proposal is that as we learn more about our marine spaces, we also take steps to protect these spaces.

2023-03-20,Protecting Our Marine Spaces and Southern Islands,014-001-095-093-021,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Nature spaces that are designated as nature reserves, national parks or public parks enjoy protection under the Parks and Trees Act. Nature reserves and national parks get the most protection. Any changes to their boundaries can only be amended after debate in Parliament. But public parks like marine parks, do not enjoy the same level of protection. Their boundaries can be redrawn without the scrutiny of Parliament.",24,26,014-001-095-093-021-026,1321

In 2001, the Government had already finalised plans to reclaim the Chek Jawa wetlands. This unique habitat – home to mudskippers, dugongs, herons and otters – was on the verge of being destroyed. But these plans were suspended only after activists commissioned a biodiversity survey, wrote their own report and submitted a petition to the Government. It was a shining day for activism. But we should not protect our marine spaces only when ordinary people take extraordinary action. These areas deserve statutory protection.",25,27,014-001-095-093-021-027,1322

As our first marine park, Sisters’ Islands Marine Park should receive more protection by elevating it to a nature reserve. The waters around the islands of Pulau Ubin, Pulau Semakau, Pulau Hantu, Pulau Jong, Pulau Biola, Pulau Satumu, St John’s Island, Kusu Island and Lazarus Island are all rich in biodiversity and have great potential as marine parks. I hope we can designate these areas as marine parks first before subsequently considering them to be nature reserves.",26,28,014-001-095-093-021-028,1323

I also saw first-hand the tremendous dedication by the researchers, activists and thousands of people, members of the public who stepped forward to speak up and fight for the protection of Chek Jawa. And I also saw how the Government responded positively, reversed our decision and protected Chek Jawa instead.",37,39,014-001-095-093-021-039,1334

2023-03-20,Protecting Our Marine Spaces and Southern Islands,014-001-095-093-021,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"For some time, visitors were generally marine scientists, casual picnickers, Kusu pilgrims, nostalgic former islanders or those in search of a trail off the beaten track. However, restlessness from COVID-19 piqued Singaporeans' interests. Visitorship on the islands increased by 2.5 times, from 6,800 a month in 2019 to 17,000 a month in 2021. In 2022, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) conducted a long-term plan review (LTPR) and engaged more than 13,000 participants in polls, discussions and webinars, which culminated in roving exhibitions. Together with some marine scientists and environmental advocates, I toured the exhibition and was interested in how the LTPR highlighted the creation of an island of ""green, blue and fun"" by expanding nature-based recreation networks and embracing islandness.

2023-03-20,Protecting Our Marine Spaces and Southern Islands,014-001-095-093-021,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),Some may wonder what is there to protect in the first place. The Southern Islands are significant in two key areas  natural and cultural heritage. The Southern Islands support coastal habitats to several nationally vulnerable or endangered species. It is also home to a rich culture and history. The islands were part of the lively settlements of Orang Laut and former islanders have religious significance and hosted Singapore's first quarantine centre – when we are talking about COVID-19 today.,7,49,014-001-095-093-021-049,1344

In recent times, we have seen two activities introduced. First, aquaculture activities taken over by Barramundi Asia Group, just beyond Bendera Bay. I note that the SFA had completed an EIA before implementation. How does the Government measure ongoing water and sediment quality as well as the potential presence of larger predators, given that the fish cages are barely 50 metres from Bendera Bay, which is stewarded by Friends of Marine Park.",10,52,014-001-095-093-021-052,1347

Like the throngs who flocked to the Southern Islands during COVID-19, staycations were also a popular activity during COVID-19. I think opportunities for Singaporeans to connect with nature are good, especially for our young, who are more likely to fall in love with our environment if they are familiar with it. I echo comments from the marine community and I sincerely appreciate the Sentosa Development Corporation's consideration in this less intrusive accommodation option. I also appreciate that SDC carried out stakeholder engagements and I would be keen to understand what environmental and safety considerations are required of the operator and whether any of the suggestions during consultation have been adopted.

Since September 2022, alongside measures on housing loans granted by financial institutions (FIs), HDB introduced an interest rate floor to compute eligible loan amounts for housing loans granted by HDB. These measures help to ensure that HDB flat buyers take on loans prudently and are better able to service their loans should interest rates rise further.",2,3,014-001-095-093-076-003,1611

However, land is scarce in Singapore and the planning and staging of sites in the Build-To-Order (BTO) flat supply are subject to site availability and readiness. Where new areas, such as Tengah, are being developed to provide housing, there is also the need to launch a sufficient quantum of flats to provide the critical mass to ensure viability of new facilities, for example, shops, and major infrastructure, such as rail lines.",1,2,014-001-095-093-077-002,1616

2023-03-20,Budget Meal Criteria in New Lease Renewal Requirements for HDB Rental Coffee Shops,014-001-095-093-078,Mr Desmond Lee,  The price of the budget meal is proposed by the operator and reviewed by HDB to ensure they are reasonable and remain affordable in reference to nearby options. This strikes a balance between the operator’s business sustainability and the needs of residents for affordable food options. Rental coffee shops leased under the Price-Quality Method tenders typically provide budget food options with prices at around $3 to $3.50 across the estates.,1,2,014-001-095-093-078-002,1620

However, operators of coffee shops who did not tender to rent their coffee shops under the Price-Quality Method will require time to make the transition with their stallholders. Hence, we will only require them to provide four budget meals and two drinks as a condition for the renewal of the coffee shop tenancy, until further review. To further ease the transition for operators and stallholders to offer the budget meals, HDB is offering them a 5% discount on the renewal rents for a period of one year.",2,3,014-001-095-093-078-003,1621
