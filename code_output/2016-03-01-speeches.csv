2016-03-01,Plans for HDB Commercial Shops with Near-expiry Leases,013-001-094-008-004,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"  Madam, similar to other leasehold properties, the shops which had been sold by HDB on 30-year lease will be returned to the lessor, in this case, HDB, upon the expiry of the lease. Where possible and if in line with future planning intentions, HDB can consider allowing lessees to rent the shops after the lease expires.",1,2,013-001-094-008-004-002,21

2016-03-01,Bookings Made for Stationary Vehicles with Engines Running,013-001-094-008-005,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"  Under the Environmental Protection and Management (Vehicular Emissions) Regulations, it is an offence to leave the engine of a motor vehicle running when it is stationary for reasons other than traffic conditions. Leaving the engine running when the vehicle is stationary, results in fuel wastage and unnecessary environmental pollution.",1,2,013-001-094-008-005-002,30

2016-03-01,Bookings Made for Stationary Vehicles with Engines Running,013-001-094-008-005,The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M),"As part of its outreach programmes, NEA works closely with stakeholders such as the authorised vehicle inspection centres, private and public transport operators and schools to disseminate educational pamphlets and decals so as to raise awareness of the regulation and forewarn motorists not to leave their vehicle engines idling. To promote greater awareness, NEA has also installed anti-vehicle idling signage at places where vehicles frequently congregate, such as carparks, loading/unloading bays and along the roadside near schools.",3,4,013-001-094-008-005-004,32

2016-03-01,Bookings Made for Stationary Vehicles with Engines Running,013-001-094-008-005,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"  Indeed, it is an area of concern. The numbers have increased largely because we have enforced more and there have been more complaints from the public. It is useful also for people who drive, to know that today, modern technology does not require you to warm up your engine before you drive. Sometimes, there is this misperception that you have to continue keeping your engine warm so that you can get better fuel efficiency or make the engine last longer.",1,7,013-001-094-008-005-007,35

2016-03-01,Effectiveness of High-rise Littering Prevention Measures,013-001-094-008-006,Mr Gan Thiam Poh –,13  To ask	the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) how many cases of high-rise littering are reported in 2015; (b) what is the number of resultant injuries and deaths; and (c) whether the current measures to deter high-rise littering are satisfactory.,2,2,013-001-094-008-006-002,41

2016-03-01,Effectiveness of High-rise Littering Prevention Measures,013-001-094-008-006,The Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources),"  In 2015, the National Environment Agency (NEA) received some 2,800 reports of high-rise littering. High-rise littering is an anti-social act and offence that can pose a threat to public health and safety. NEA has been working with the Town Councils and grassroots organisations to remind residents of the dangers of high-rise littering. In addition to the reports received by NEA, SPF's records showed that in 2015, two persons were arrested for throwing killer litter which resulted in hurt. SPF did not receive any reports of death from killer litter in 2015.",1,4,013-001-094-008-006-004,43

When feedback on high-rise littering is received, outreach and education efforts to caution residents against high-rise littering will be conducted by my Ministry, the Town Councils and grassroots organisations, and in most cases the situation will improve after these efforts. However, in cases of persistent high-rise littering, NEA will deploy surveillance cameras once a suitable deployment site has been identified.",2,5,013-001-094-008-006-005,44

Last year, NEA took more than 800 enforcement actions against high-rise litterbugs, an eighty-fold increase compared to 2011, when the surveillance cameras had not been introduced yet. Offenders who were prosecuted in Court received fines ranging from $700 to $5,600.",3,6,013-001-094-008-006-006,45

While the effective conviction of high-rise litterbugs will serve as a deterrent to would-be offenders, I would like to urge every member of the public to play his part to cultivate social graciousness, good habits, and a sense of shared responsibility for the cleanliness and safety of our neighbourhoods.",4,7,013-001-094-008-006-007,46
2016-03-01,Effectiveness of High-rise Littering Prevention Measures,013-001-094-008-006,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"  Mdm Speaker, I thank the Senior Minister of State for the answer. I would like to ask  for recalcitrant high-rise litterbugs, would the Ministry consider imposing a certain limit whereby if they have exceeded a number of times where they were caught for high-rise littering, that tougher measures beyond just fines will be imposed on them; for example, in very extreme cases, perhaps, confiscation of their flats. I believe there are some cases, where the litterbugs have been really recalcitrant despite many, many fines already imposed on the persons. Will the Ministry consider such a measure?",1,8,013-001-094-008-006-008,47
2016-03-01,Effectiveness of High-rise Littering Prevention Measures,013-001-094-008-006,Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson),"Also, one of the issues is that high-rise litterbugs continue to offend on a daily basis, thinking they can get away with it. Will the Ministry consider revealing the identity of litterbugs who may be caught on camera so that the grassroots or agencies can then follow up with these persons, and to try and persuade the persons to not litter in the future?",2,9,013-001-094-008-006-009,48
2016-03-01,Effectiveness of High-rise Littering Prevention Measures,013-001-094-008-006,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"  I want to thank the Member for her suggestions as well as her questions. Firstly, for recalcitrant high-rise litterbugs, to consider if we should cap the limit for the fine imposed. First of all, for high-rise litterbugs, the fine is not compounded. They have to attend court, and the court will decide on the fines to be imposed. But certainly, this is something that we can follow up on.",1,10,013-001-094-008-006-010,49
2016-03-01,Effectiveness of High-rise Littering Prevention Measures,013-001-094-008-006,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Regarding the acquisition of a property, we need to carefully consider this. In most instances, in fact since we started the implementation of surveillance cameras, as I have noted earlier, we have been able to effectively enforce on a significant number of litterbugs. Last year, for instance, more than 800 enforcement actions were taken and we hope that this will be a deterrence. Before we even deploy surveillance cameras, we undertake education and outreach efforts, including house-to-house visits. In most cases, the littering would stop or improve. Therefore, implementing the surveillance cameras acts as a deterrence.",2,11,013-001-094-008-006-011,50
2016-03-01,Effectiveness of High-rise Littering Prevention Measures,013-001-094-008-006,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Having said that, for recalcitrant offenders, we also have to look at the facts of each case. In cases where it may be due to mental issues, we work closely with the grassroots, as well as with the family members, to see what assistance can be rendered, as well as to implement measures to prevent this littering from happening, for instance, even installing wire mesh across the grills of the windows to prevent the littering offence. We need to look at each case separately and be mindful that some of these may be due to specific issues.",3,12,013-001-094-008-006-012,51

Firstly, of course, we have stepped up our outreach and education efforts. Secondly, we have increased the number of camera deployments since the adoption of this method to catch persistent high-rise litterbugs in 2012.",1,14,013-001-094-008-006-014,53
2016-03-01,Effectiveness of High-rise Littering Prevention Measures,013-001-094-008-006,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"We have increased the number of camera deployments by more than four times to close to 3,000 over the last three years. In fact just last year alone, there were more than 1,000 camera deployments.

Second, would the Ministry continue upgrading the camera technology so that there can be better night-vision image acquisition as well as higher resolution images?

2016-03-01,Effectiveness of High-rise Littering Prevention Measures,013-001-094-008-006,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"  We agree with Members that high-rise littering is an anti-social act and it is something that we must not condone and will not tolerate as it poses a threat to public health and safety. At the end of the day, I think all of us need to play our part to cultivate social graciousness, good habits, as well as a sense of shared responsibility. Deploying more and more cameras really is not sustainable and it is also not desirable. But having said that, we take every high-rise littering feedback seriously and, where there is a need to deploy the camera, we will do so.",1,20,013-001-094-008-006-020,59
2016-03-01,Effectiveness of High-rise Littering Prevention Measures,013-001-094-008-006,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Regarding the success rate of the cameras in identifying perpetrators, on the whole, based on the number of camera deployments, it is about one-third. The reason is that, very often, when we put up a camera, it may actually deter the litterbug from littering if he is aware that there is a camera focused on him or the unit. In some instances, it could also be because of intelligence or understanding of the ground, the camera could be focused on the wrong unit or on the wrong column and then we will have to redeploy it.",2,21,013-001-094-008-006-021,60

2016-03-01,Measures to Prevent and Minimise Impact of Oil Spills,013-001-094-008-007,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"  Mdm Speaker, there were about 6,500 oil spill incidents in the last five years. Most were minor spills that did not lead to significant traffic disruptions. Only 13 were serious cases that required the roads to be resurfaced, resulting in severe traffic jams. This year, four major oil spills have occurred on Singapore roads. There is no clear commonality in the profile of the drivers involved. Both local and foreign drivers and vehicles were involved.",1,5,013-001-094-008-007-005,66
2016-03-01,Measures to Prevent and Minimise Impact of Oil Spills,013-001-094-008-007,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"Most oil spills are caused by accidents or breakdowns.

EMAS signs on the expressways and arterial roads currently show only the key information related to traffic incidents, such as the root causes and the magnitude. As oil spills are not root causes and are, in fact, often caused by root causes like vehicular breakdowns or accidents, they are not reflected in the EMAS.",1,9,013-001-094-008-007-009,70

2016-03-01,Clawback Amounts from Productivity and Innovation Credit Payouts,013-001-094-008-008,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),"  Mdm Speaker, since inception until January this year, 102,000 companies have benefited in one way or another from the Productivity and Innovation Credit. To put this into perspective, this is 70% of all active companies in IRAS' records for the Year of Assessment 2014. For a scheme with such a wide reach, it is expected that some taxpayers will try to game the system through artificial and contrived arrangements even as the majority of claims are genuine. For example, a group of taxpayers had hired each other as employees and paid each other just enough to satisfy the three-local employee condition in order to qualify for the cash payout.",1,2,013-001-094-008-008-002,73

Relying on the experiences of IRAS investigators and advanced analytics, IRAS has investigated or audited about 71,000 claims, or around 30% of the PIC Cash Payout claims made from Years of Assessment 2011 to 2015. 1,500 of these claims investigated or audited required clawback. As for the amount of cash payout clawed back, for Years of Assessment 2011 to 2014, IRAS has clawed back $11 million. $8 million has been recovered to date.",2,3,013-001-094-008-008-003,74

I am sorry – the figures were too much for me to remember, but I wonder if the Senior Minister of State could clarify, out of the applications made for cash payouts, how many percent of the claims were rejected before payout and how many needed to be clawed back after payout?

2016-03-01,Clawback Amounts from Productivity and Innovation Credit Payouts,013-001-094-008-008,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Thirdly, I understand that IRAS has prosecuted some people in Court for PIC fraud and there are also some cases pending prosecution as well. From the IRAS website, the cases that were reported as prosecuted appeared to involve the grant recipients.

After they have been investigated or audited and rejected upfront, it is about 43,000. There are a number of investigated and audited cases that led to actual clawback.

That is something that we constantly look at to see how we can improve it. But there is also the other aspect, which is where people deliberately attempt to abuse the system. And that is, in fact, the reason why we do these audits. We want to make sure that even though on the face of it, it looks like they have done the application properly, you have got to look behind it. That is why IRAS does investigate and audit.

2016-03-01,Ensuring Fair Terms in Government Contracts,013-001-094-008-009,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),"  Madam, Government agencies are expected to conduct procurements in a fair and reasonable manner. To guide agencies, the Ministry of Finance provides templates on the contractual terms and conditions for common types of buys which agencies make. Agencies can choose to use these templates or adapt them accordingly to cater to their specific unique needs. From time to time, these templates are reviewed, taking into account feedback that we receive and any appropriate industrial norms. For example, following industry feedback, our IT procurement contract terms were amended so that when the original equipment manufacturer's vendor defaults, the replacement vendor is compensated at prevailing fair market value instead of having to accept the previous vendor's rates.",1,2,013-001-094-008-009-002,88

There are also contracts which do not impose liquidated damages. Whatever the case, Government agencies are advised to work closely with their contractors to resolve issues early. As far as possible, agencies and contractors are not to let problems escalate to the point where contractual non-fulfilment is reached.",2,3,013-001-094-008-009-003,89
2016-03-01,Ensuring Fair Terms in Government Contracts,013-001-094-008-009,The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Finance),"There are training modules that guide officers on how to write the tender specifications or the scope of work expected of the tenderer. However, it is not possible for training to cover every scenario on what is fair or unfair, or every type of purchase that Government agencies make. The Government buys a wide variety of goods and services, and each industry has differing practices and norms. What is considered the norm and reasonable in one industry may not be so in another. For example, in the creative design industry, the industry norm allows up to three rounds of consolidated changes after the design concept has been signed off. But this does not apply to architecture design of buildings. Given the differences across industries and situation in which a procurement is made, any audit on whether the tender specifications are fair would have to take into account the context and the circumstances when the particular procurement is called.",3,4,013-001-094-008-009-004,90

I would encourage suppliers who have any questions about a specific tender or quotation whether on the tender specifications or contractual terms and conditions, to contact the agencies.

What one would have to rely on are the general principles of contracts. There is obviously bargaining power; that is one of the things that you take into account. But when a contract is particularly unfair and crosses a particular line, then, in some cases, in the Courts, the Courts will strike it down. We do have the Unfair Contract Terms Act. If it contravenes the Unfair Contract Terms Act, then, obviously, certain things will not be enforced. That is a matter of general law and that has developed over time.

2016-03-01,Changes in the Doctor- and Nurse-to-Population Ratios,013-001-094-008-014,The Minister of State for Health (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Health),"  Mdm Speaker, at the last Parliament Sitting in January, I informed Mr Leon Perera that Singapore's doctor-to-population ratio in 2014 was 21 doctors per 10,000 population, compared to 18 in Hong Kong and Taiwan. For nurses, we have 69 nurses per 10,000 population compared to 66 in Hong Kong and 60 in Taiwan. I also explained that these ratios could only offer a broad comparison, and we need to be mindful about differences in healthcare demand, clinical practices and operating environments.

We are on track to growing the healthcare workforce by 20,000 between 2011 and 2020. So, our staffing ratios will go up.

To keep our healthcare system sustainable, we must step up efforts to help Singaporeans to stay healthy and enable our seniors to age well. MOH is also working in close collaboration with healthcare institutions, unions and community partners to develop new care models and improve productivity, so that we can continue to provide high quality of care for Singaporeans and a good working environment for our healthcare workers. We are adopting this tripartite partnership approach to attract and train more Singaporeans to join the healthcare sector, improve productivity in our healthcare institutions and enable our healthcare workers to continue working till a later age.",3,4,013-001-094-008-014-004,172

I have a few supplementary questions. In regard to the assurance from the Minister of State that our staffing numbers will improve in future, which is a welcomed assurance, my question would be  does he feel that the doctor-to-population and nurse-to-population ratios right now are not really where they should be? And if so, what are the mitigation measures that the Ministry is considering to deal with that current situation? That is the first question.",1,6,013-001-094-008-014-006,174
2016-03-01,Changes in the Doctor- and Nurse-to-Population Ratios,013-001-094-008-014,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The second question is  would the Ministry consider evaluating the feasibility to set a target for doctor-to-population and nurse-to-population ratios? The reason I ask that question is because I think that, looking at where Singapore stands versus other OECD countries, we are quite close to Hong Kong and Taiwan. But there is a considerable body of expert opinion that there is a doctor and nurse shortage in Hong Kong and Taiwan. There are various reports, for example, the Brookings Institution, Taiwan National Institute of Health, Hong Kong University, Hong Kong Hospital Authority, and so on, which have acknowledged that there is a situation of doctor and nurse shortage in those countries. So, it concerns me that we are closer to those countries on the OECD spectrum. Would the Ministry consider setting a target or an ideal zone that we want to move towards in future?",2,7,013-001-094-008-014-007,175

This is something that the Ministry of Health had previously already provided. The figures are in the public domain. We will be increasing the number of healthcare workers between 2011 and 2020. This is not something that is because of what is happening now, and therefore we are hiring more workers. It is in recognition that our population is ageing and we expect healthcare demand to go up. So, we are building more hospitals; we are hiring more healthcare workers, not only to take care of the current situation but in preparation for what is going to come in the future.",1,8,013-001-094-008-014-008,176

One growing area of concern of my Ministry is with the state of public cleanliness in Singapore. Over the years, Singapore has earned a reputation as a clean city - this is something that many Singaporeans are proud of and many of us view a clean environment as an important part of the Singapore identity, as reflected in some of the polls that have been conducted.",3,4,013-001-094-008-018-004,222

Members would have read in the news of how festival-goers of Laneway Music Festival in 2015 and 2016 left the venue littered with trash despite the fervent efforts of volunteers from the Traceless Movement who went around the event venue to pick up trash strewn on the floor. Just a few weeks ago, members would have read in the news about the large amount of litter that was left behind after the countdown to 2016 at Marina Bay. The organiser subsequently mobilised 300 cleaners to ensure that 30,000 kg worth of trash was cleared up. Many concerned members of public have also provided feedback on how to improve the situation. During a recent radio discussion, some callers pressed for harsher penalties while many more said that there should be a focus of creating a culture of community ownership.",4,5,013-001-094-008-018-005,223

Last year, NEA issued more than 26,000 tickets to littering offenders, 32% more than previous years and the highest in six years. We have also taken a tougher stance towards littering by imposing stiffer penalties for recalcitrant offenders In addition, we are expending significant resources to keep public areas clean - as much as $120 million each year is spent on cleaning public areas with some hotspots cleaned every two hours.",5,6,013-001-094-008-018-006,224

Indeed, it is not even related to the number of waste bins we provide for the convenience of the public. Members who have been to Japan would agree that the level of public cleanliness there is much higher than Singapore. The public areas in Japan are cleaner not because there is a large army of cleaners, but because of the Japanese people's habits and social norms. Indeed, in many public places, bins are scarce in Japan. This is something that we can strive to emulate by creating a culture of community ownership so that everyone takes responsibility in maintaining high standards of public cleanliness and hygiene and treat public places like their own homes.",6,7,013-001-094-008-018-007,225

As part of the Keep Singapore Clean movement, the Public Hygiene Council partnered residents, schools, businesses and community groups to turn our community spaces into ""Bright Spots"" – these are essentially shared spaces adopted by stakeholders who take ownership of the area's cleanliness and hygiene conditions and lead by example to promote good social norms. Since the launch of NEA's Community Volunteer (CV) programme in 2013, NEA's CV programme has been successful in attracting more than 340 passionate individuals from various non-Government organisations to step forward as Community Volunteers (CVs) to help us educate others about public cleanliness and nudge those observed littering to bin their litter instead. To date, our CVs have collectively engaged more than 2,500 litterbugs.",7,8,013-001-094-008-018-008,226

Last year, my Ministry announced during the Committee of Supply debate that we will expand the CV programme so as to allow members of the public to take greater ownership of the environment. Specifically, we will allow individuals to join the expanded CV programme without having to be affiliated to a recognised environmental group and empower them to engage offenders for a wider range of offences beyond littering. This will broaden the pool who can be tapped on to join the programme. In addition, we will allow CVs to have the option of participating in advocacy, outreach and educational activities. Through the expanded CV programme, we hope to see more CVs taking ownership of the cleanliness and hygiene conditions of existing Bright Spots numbering more than 520 and lead by example to promote good social norms.",8,9,013-001-094-008-018-009,227

Clause 5(b) defines ""environmental written law"" to mean any written law administered by NEA, the Director-General of Environmental Protection or the Director-General of Public Health.

I would like to inform Members of the House that as an auxiliary officer is deemed, under the new section 42A(5) of the NEA Act, to be a public servant for the purposes of the Penal Code when exercising a power of enforcement, the auxiliary officer will be protected under section 6 of the Protection from Harassment Act from any indecent, threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour or words towards the auxiliary officer in relation to the execution of the auxiliary officer's duty.",10,11,013-001-094-008-018-011,229

Clauses 2(b) and 4(b) will amend the EPHA and CVPA to enable these APOs to be appointed as ""authorised officers"" for the administration of the EPHA and CVPA.

2016-03-01,National Environment Agency (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill,013-001-094-008-018,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"  Mdm Speaker, volunteers have always been valuable resources to any community. Whether it is to help out in a civil disaster, provide companionship at a nursing home or even a neighbourhood clean-up programme. Undoubtedly, without volunteers, many projects and plans would not be able to achieve the desired results. The volunteers are a unique group of people who are always on the ground, doing their part for the community without much fanfare. Most importantly, they are a positive influence on the people around them to volunteer for the good of the community.",1,18,013-001-094-008-018-018,236
2016-03-01,National Environment Agency (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill,013-001-094-008-018,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"I am delighted to note that the amendment to the existing NEA Act is looking towards expanding the Community Volunteer scheme. This has been a good scheme to encourage responsibility and ownership for the environment. However, under the existing scheme, only members of selected environmental-related societies or councils could be appointed as Community Volunteers (CVs). To my understanding, the number of these groups currently stands at four. In Singapore, we have at least 44 registered environmental-related NGOs. Singaporeans are a more civic-minded lot and I believe there is a lot of potential in the CV scheme. Certainly, I pledge my full support to expand the CV scheme so that individuals too can be appointed as CVs.",2,19,013-001-094-008-018-019,237

I was asked, ""Bee Wah, are you sure or not? What if you go and pick litter, no one follow you?"" I am glad that every month there are about 100 to 200 residents – students, nurses from Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Lions members – as well as residents beyond Nee Soon South, those who care about environment, come and join us. I deeply appreciate their contributions and I am sure some of these residents will be keen to volunteer under the CV scheme.",4,21,013-001-094-008-018-021,239
2016-03-01,National Environment Agency (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill,013-001-094-008-018,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"Litter has been a constant thorn faced by many developed countries and densely populated cities. A great number of annual anti-litter picking campaigns are held worldwide  ""Clean Up the World, Don't Mess with Texas, Keep Britain Tidy, Keep Australia Beautiful, Hong Kong is The Face of Litter"". These are just a few memorable ones out of the many national and localised campaigns held in countries across the global map. In Singapore, we have our very own ""Keep Singapore Clean"" campaign. And in Nee Soon South we have our own ""HABIT"". There are numerous NGOs world-wide supporting community clean-up efforts. These campaigns certainly bear some weight in keeping the littering problem at bay.",5,22,013-001-094-008-018-022,240

Education, coupled with efficient and effective enforcement, is the way forward. That is why I am very happy to hear the Minister for Ministry of Education announce last week that school students will do the daily cleaning and it will be implemented in all schools by the end of 2016. Certainly, this is a very good start. I hope that, eventually, it will be progressed, like what is happening in Japan and Taiwan, where every student not just clean their own classroom, they clean the school compound, they wash toilets and they sort out the litter and they do not have cleaners in the schools.",6,23,013-001-094-008-018-023,241

This not only helps to save resources and generate more efficiency, but as a ground-up initiative, it will have more social impact. It will foster social norm and I hope that it will remind would-be litterbugs that there are eyes around them; there are people who care and love the environment watching them all the time.",7,24,013-001-094-008-018-024,242

They play a crucial role in neighbourhood and police work, freeing up time and resources for the police to focus on other more crucial crimes.

2016-03-01,National Environment Agency (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill,013-001-094-008-018,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"But as with all ""super volunteers"", the greatest challenge remains in finding volunteers with the relevant skills, commitment and integrity to carry out their duties. Passion is important, but it does not necessarily equate suitability. Adequate training and resources will have to be invested in this programme. I believe there would be stringent screening of those who want to volunteer under this scheme so that what attracts them is their passion to serve and not the appetite for authority or power.",10,27,013-001-094-008-018-027,245

But like any work, be it full-time or voluntary, people must be properly motivated and managed. Early this year, there have been some opinion pieces in the TODAYnewspaper discussing the act of incentivising volunteers. I think volunteer management is something we need to consider very carefully in our long-term plan to recruit and empower more volunteers.",12,29,013-001-094-008-018-029,247

How do we keep that flame alive year after year? Job satisfaction, the feeling of being wanted, the thought of having made a difference, their love for environment are powerful emotions that spur the volunteers. Volunteers need to feel appreciated to continue their work or they will move on to other causes. One thing can be for sure, we should never reduce volunteerism to just a dollar value.

Many think that this is not their job. And some even labelled their friends or volunteers, ""They are kaypoh."" The inclination is to shower less admiration for their work done. Perhaps, employers should pay more attention to job applicants who are volunteering for good causes.

The eventual goal of expanding the Community Volunteer scheme should lead to long-term plans to further this to the masses.

Contributions from Community Volunteers are not as noticeable as volunteers who help the vulnerable. The authority should explore how to increase the environment awareness of the society and encourage the community to express gratitude towards these volunteers.

This will partially help tackle the littering problem in Singapore and is undoubtedly a positive step forward. This, however, cannot be the only focus or the main focus of our efforts towards a clean Singapore. Increased enforcement is important but perhaps, what is more important is a mindset change. What we need to focus on more is ownership of our living space and how everyone has an important part to play.",1,92,013-001-094-008-018-092,310

I worked with Hanif, one of our Nee Soon Town Council's cleaner and through this first-hand experience, it is clear to me that we are a cleaned city rather than a clean city. I picked up so much litter that day – cigarette butts, cotton buds, tissue, condoms, nappies – the list goes on. After spending the morning cleaning an area, it was alarming to go back to the same area a few hours later to find it covered in litter again. The cleaners face an uphill task and almost an impossible task at times.",2,93,013-001-094-008-018-093,311

These figures I believe are the tip of the iceberg and there are clearly more people who have littered but did not get caught. Again, increased enforcement might help in nabbing more offenders but we need to fundamentally understand why they are littering and make sure we address the root of the problem. We need to remember, as reported by Channel NewsAsiarecently, that the survey by NEA in 2010 showed that a third of Singaporeans would litter if they think they can get away with it. I hope this does not just become a cat-and-mouse game with the litterbugs. We need a mindset change, and this mindset change is important for our society.",3,94,013-001-094-008-018-094,312

There is no ownership of common areas. Would you litter in your own house? If you see a piece of tissue paper in your own house, would you ignore it and walk by? The answer is clearly no, and that is because you want to make your own house clean and tidy. So, why do we not translate this behaviour to our common areas?",5,96,013-001-094-008-018-096,314

So, the researchers decided to focus their efforts on reducing this problem. They realised that large scale events on anti-littering are not as effective as small community efforts targeted at hotspots of littering. The population at those large scale events might not necessarily include that target group of people utilising the bus-stops. The engendering message is better received by paying more effort on-site. By using attention-grabbing posters, they were able to counter people's lack of sensitivity to the generic ""do not litter"" signs.

In 1987, $2 million in tax revenue went to litter-picking and that cost was escalating 15-20% every year. After performing extensive research, they identified who the heavy litterers were. They are a pick-up driver, male, between 18 and 34 years old, who likes sports and country music, has an anti-authority disposition and is not motivated by appeals to civic duty. They were indifferent to the typical messaging about the environment and the cost of cleaning. So, Texas decided to focus on these heavy litterers by appealing to their macho-ness. They realised they could succeed by associating littering with as being unmanly. Resources were pumped into getting popular country singers and athletes to do TV, radio advertisements and highway billboards to influence these litterers. As a result, Texas was able to cut their litter on their highway by 72% in the first six years of their campaign. In terms of spending, they saved a total of US$4.13 million by 1997.",9,100,013-001-094-008-018-100,318

Can I suggest that the Minister allow the process of volunteers following NEA officers to run its course before we consider giving volunteers enforcement powers? Because the fact of the matter is it seems that, as most Members have suggested, the educative approach is really the way forward, and the Minister himself agrees.

They went home. Benjamin had lunch. He played games on his phone. Sometime later, his mother told Benjamin that he would not be going to the school camp that was to start the next day. That was after a telephone conversation between the mother and a school counsellor. The Minister of Education will provide more details on that conversation. At about 4.20 pm, Benjamin was found dead at the foot of his block. These are the facts.",5,27,013-001-094-008-019-027,403

2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"Over the last five years, from 2011 to 2015, a total of 7,196 young persons have assisted Police in investigations. Of these, 70%, that is, seven out of 10 were either warned or placed in a Guidance Programme or had no further action taken against them. About 15% were charged. Another 15% of the cases are under consideration.",7,29,013-001-094-008-019-029,405
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"Charges are usually only brought against young persons when there are aggravating factors. Such as when the offence is of a serious nature like rioting, or if the young person is a repeat offender, or has breached the terms of a conditional warning, for example by failing to complete the necessary Guidance Programme.",8,30,013-001-094-008-019-030,406
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"As the statistics show, the Police's approach to young persons is, wherever possible, to try and avoid criminalising the conduct. It is better to give young people a second chance and help in their rehabilitation. It is likely that on the evidence available to us, Benjamin would have received no more than a warning. He is unlikely to have been charged in Court. Police would have taken into account his age, the fact that this is the first time and while all molests are taken seriously, the nature of the specific molest in any case has to be considered.",9,31,013-001-094-008-019-031,407
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"The nature of the alleged molest in this particular case can be characterised as being less serious in a range. That is based on CCTV footages. I would, however, caution that the statistics I have given and the relatively tolerant approach that the Police take towards young persons should not be seen as a licence for young persons to commit offences on the basis that seven out of 10 will not be charged.",10,32,013-001-094-008-019-032,408
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"Let me now deal with the second of my four points. The Police Protocol for dealing with young persons. Police adopt an expedited process for young persons  to interview them and release them as quickly as possible to their parents. In this case, Benjamin was released to his mother within four hours of being brought to the Station. Where suitable, a young person will be placed on a programme to help him. An example is the Guidance Programme. The focus is on diversionary supervision and counselling. Young persons will usually be students. The Police guidelines are for the school to be kept updated on the progress of the case. That will allow the school to monitor and support the student.",11,33,013-001-094-008-019-033,409
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,Do we need to amend the Protocol for interviewing young persons? I have asked my Ministry to review the Protocol. One suggestion that has been made is to video-record interviews of all minors. We have announced last year that we are studying the matter of Video Recording. We will make further announcements when we have worked through the legal and other issues.,12,34,013-001-094-008-019-034,410
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,Another suggestion that has been made is that we extend the Appropriate Adult Scheme to all young persons being interviewed. We have the Appropriate Adult Scheme to provide assistance to suspects who have mental and intellectual disabilities. The role of the Appropriate Adult is to assist these persons to communicate more effectively with the Police. Police have said in their statement of 1 February that they will consider this point during the review.,13,35,013-001-094-008-019-035,411
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"The Association of Criminal Lawyers of Singapore (ACLS) has contacted us and offered to give us their views. We will engage them and get their views. But I will caution against rushing to conclusions at this stage. If there is something we can do better, we will do so. In the review, the following three broad points will be taken into account, in addition to other factors. Those three points are  one, what happened in this case; two, the types of young persons who get picked up; and three, how can we reduce systemic risk?",14,36,013-001-094-008-019-036,412
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"Let me deal with the three points. First, the experience in this case. Are there any specific indications in this case that the processes need to be changed? I have set out the facts that we know – facts which we believe are accurate. There is nothing so far on the evidence to suggest that Benjamin was mistreated by the Police. I have set out how the investigation was done. At this stage, we cannot say, that the interview was the specific reason for the suicide. Suicide often involves a very complex set of factors. One has look at the facts carefully, consult experts to try and get an assessment as to what happened.",15,37,013-001-094-008-019-037,413
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,Police will also consult psychologists and other relevant experts. Some people have asked  why did we need to take him out of the school? Could we not have waited until Benjamin got home?,16,38,013-001-094-008-019-038,414
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mdm Speaker, we need to be clear about how we expect Police to investigate cases in general. Let me explain. When Police went to the school, they did not know who he was or his history. An accused person unknown to the Police could well have engaged in other molest, and until then, maybe no one had reported. If the Police wait, and he molests someone else in the meantime, then the question would be – why did the Police not move in faster?",17,39,013-001-094-008-019-039,415
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"When an incident happens, as a general rule, I am sure we want the Police to move in quickly. Every year, we pick up more than 1,300 young persons – students and also others. What do Members think the public's attitudes will be if it was the victim of the molest who had committed suicide? Police would be expected to have moved quickly. This will become clearer when I deal with my next point – the types of young persons we pick up.",18,40,013-001-094-008-019-040,416
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"Young people get picked up for a wide range of offences, from rioting, sexual assault, physical assault to even murder. Some, obviously, involved in very serious offences. Police need to move quickly, arrest, investigate, before the others, including other gang members, destroy evidence.",19,41,013-001-094-008-019-041,417
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"Should we make distinctions based on the types of offences involved? What about gang riots? What about deliberate arson or Unlicensed Money Lending cases? What about those which are more security related; say, a 14-year-old, who was radicalised and wants to go out and kill?",20,42,013-001-094-008-019-042,418
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"Internal Security Department (ISD) has interviewed some in that age group. And to prove the point, two weeks ago, we stopped a 15-year-old radicalised boy from Indonesia. He had wanted to go and fight in the Middle East. So, let us take this seriously.",21,43,013-001-094-008-019-043,419
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"Let me now turn to the third point – we must reduce systemic risk where possible. We cannot assume that all Police officers will always follow protocols. There will be some who will be tempted to take short-cuts. We have to ensure that we have a system that minimises the risks. I say minimise, because there is no system in the world that I know of which eliminates the risks completely. This factor of needing to minimise the risk will be taken into account when we review the Protocol.",22,44,013-001-094-008-019-044,420
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"In this context, Police will look at past experience, the thousands of young persons who have been investigated. Members can see that there are many aspects to this issue, many questions which need to be carefully considered. The current Protocol had considered these, but we will review again. This is not a situation where we should have knee-jerk reactions or come to hasty conclusions. Any of our children could have been in Benjamin's position and any of our daughters could have been in that 11-year-old girl's position. We will approach the review of the processes with that perspective.",23,45,013-001-094-008-019-045,421
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mdm Speaker, let me add another point. My Ministry has the responsibility for the Protocol that is in place. And ultimately, responsibility is with me, as the Minister. It is not with individual Police officers. Their responsibility is to act according to the Protocol in place. In this case, on the facts that have been given to me, I believe that they have carried out their duties, faithfully and properly in accordance with the rules and the Protocols. If there are questions about the Protocols, I will answer, as I am doing now. If there are issues with the Protocol, the responsibility is mine. Let us not attack the Police officers who cannot defend themselves. They are doing their job every day, in difficult circumstances.",24,46,013-001-094-008-019-046,422
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"Madam, now let me turn to the deliberate falsehoods that have been put out to tar the police unfairly. This is the third of my four major points. There have been a number of inaccurate statements that have been put out. We say ""inaccurate"", based on the facts the police have. Some of the inaccurate statements are as follows  (i) that the police were not in plain clothes when they went to the school to identify Benjamin, effectively alleging that the police were lying to Singaporeans when they put out their statement of 1 February; (ii) allegations that Benjamin was interviewed and intimidated by five police officers; (iii) that he must have been coerced to make an admission to an offence that he did not commit; and (iv) some have even suggested that the girl might not have been molested and might have made a false Police report.",25,47,013-001-094-008-019-047,423
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"A number of these falsehoods have been put out by The Online Citizen (TOC). It has gone on a planned, orchestrated campaign, using falsehoods and has published about 20 articles or so, as part of its campaign. One example of the falsehoods, as I had said earlier, Police have said on 1 February that they went down in plain clothes. Yet TOC published an article on 5 February saying that police wore attire stating the word ""Police"". The suggestion is that the police were lying to Singaporeans.",26,48,013-001-094-008-019-048,424
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"They supposedly relied on a posting by a lady, Mary Anne Pereira. She had stated that her son saw Police officers with Polo T-shirts in the word ""Police"". Police checked with Ms Pereira. She says she had gotten it wrong. She got her dates mixed up. She is wrong because the Police went to the school, in plain clothes on 26 January. She has taken down her post.",27,49,013-001-094-008-019-049,425
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"People make many statements online. They can be mistaken. That is why there is a Court process to establish the truth. The overall narrative and impression conveyed by the various TOC articles are  (i) Police were lying; (2) Police intimidated the boy; and (3) Police put pressure on him to confess to a crime that he did not commit. Allegations, implications which are false, practically leading people to conclude that Benjamin committed suicide as a result.",28,50,013-001-094-008-019-050,426

Where the Police are wrong, we must and we will take action. But we should not allow deliberate, dishonest attacks. I have asked my Ministry to study how the Police and other institutions can respond in future to such falsehoods.",1,53,013-001-094-008-019-053,429
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"Others have also commented on this matter. Many of them are honest, reasonable people, who have genuine questions. But as I read the commentaries, it seems that many based themselves on a misperception of the facts which I had referred to earlier. That brings me to my fourth major point – why has my Ministry not commented substantially, particularly to correct these inaccuracies, until now?",2,54,013-001-094-008-019-054,430
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mdm Speaker, I told my Ministry, earlier on, that we should refrain from commenting too much, or in detail, on this matter. I decided that for two reasons  (1) out respect for the family, to give them some space and time to grieve; and (2) there will be a Coroner's Inquiry (CI). That is the right forum for the relevant facts to be dealt with. I think Members will know when I keep quiet, usually there is a good reason; a good legal reason.",3,55,013-001-094-008-019-055,431
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"Let me touch on both reasons. A family has lost a 14-year-old boy. They issued a statement – an open letter, signed by Benjamin's father. That statement contradicted some of the things Police had said on 1 February and made some additional points which the Police disagreed with. The family also suggested that Benjamin had been coerced into admitting to the molest. The Police could have immediately rebutted the family's statement. The Police could have set out their version, like what I have set out today. The Police could have released the CCTV footages, which would show, quite objectively, what happened inside the lift. They could have referred to the open plan office; they could have referred to him making a detour from school to home and going into the lift with the girl. They could have shown that he went up; the incident took place; he then got out and ran back down.",4,56,013-001-094-008-019-056,432
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"But is that the right thing to do? To have a public trial by media, at this stage; rebut the family in public and add to the family's grief? The answer, in good sense, is clearly no. We can understand that the family, in their grief, may genuinely believe some things, and perhaps even assert them in public. But we chose not to respond. These matters can be dealt with at the Coroner's Inquiry. And even at this stage, I have decided that we should not release the CCTV footages of what happened in the lift, out of respect for Benjamin's memory and to help the young girl as well.",5,57,013-001-094-008-019-057,433
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"Police have also continued to engage the family. When Police spoke with Benjamin's family last week, his father told us that the family felt pressured by the public and media attention. Photographers and reporters have been loitering around their house. He asked for privacy and explained that he would like his family to be kept out of the spotlight. He asked that we inform the media of this and tell the media that the family did not want their identity, names, pictures published. The family even asked for the entire Coroner's Inquiry proceedings to be held in private.",6,58,013-001-094-008-019-058,434
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"Attorney General's Chamber (AGC) will give their request careful consideration. Ultimately, it will be up to the Court to decide. Yesterday, the father spoke with a Police officer. He repeated those requests. Now, let me deal with the second reason why we did not comment in detail, until today.",7,59,013-001-094-008-019-059,435
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"The CI will, to the extent possible, try to establish the cause Benjamin's death and the facts. All Coroner's Inquiries in Singapore are held in public, unless the Court decides that some part of it should be in private. For example in this case, it can be argued that the identity of the 11-year-old girl should not be revealed. She is a young victim who has been deeply traumatised, and it could be argued that the CCTV footage of what happened within the lift should be viewed in private as well, for the sake of Benjamin's memory and for the young girl. Once the Coroner announces his findings, both facts and conclusions, then people can offer their criticisms, viewpoints, comments on what the Police did, what my Ministry did, or did not do. That is the official version of the facts; after people are cross-examined on the stand.",8,60,013-001-094-008-019-060,436
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"Sub judice principles set out what can and cannot be said when a Court hearing or Inquiry is pending. The various pronouncements, suggestions, statements which imply and allege that five officers interviewed him, that the Police pressured and intimidated Benjamin into wrongly admitting to guilt, and that these must have been amongst the reasons why he committed suicide. All these allegations possibly infringe the principles of sub judice, apart from being highly improper at this stage, prior to the Coroner's Inquiry. The Coroner decides on the scope of the Inquiry based on the Coroner's Act. Some of these issues may be raised at, or become relevant, at the Inquiry.",9,61,013-001-094-008-019-061,437
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"Police came out publicly on 1 February – six days after the incident, five days after they went to the school – to say there would be a Coroner's Inquiry, once police investigations into the death were completed. They made it public. And Police said in their statement that all relevant facts would be presented, and where the family would be able to raise all questions that they may have. This is Singapore. There is no such thing as a cover-up. Yet, some, like TOC, continued making accusations, insinuations, speculating, on the facts, well after that.",10,62,013-001-094-008-019-062,438
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"As I have said, it is understandable when the family says some things. But TOC and its ilk should not engage in this, prior to the Coroner's Inquiry. TOC also used some other tactics – they tried to get the Police to comment on allegations relating to this case, and further assert that since the Police and the Ministry were not responding, therefore the Police must be guilty of the various allegations, assertions that have been made. The Police, out of respect for the Coroner's Inquiry process, were right in not responding.",11,63,013-001-094-008-019-063,439

He has said five Police officers spoke to Benjamin. That is false. He has said that five officers took Benjamin to the Police Station, that is also false; and that Police should have behaved in a less intimidating way. He seems to make the assertion of intimation, based on his other statements which are themselves false. His statements practically imply that Benjamin killed himself because of police intimidation.",12,64,013-001-094-008-019-064,440

He need only to have referred to the Police Statement of 1 February to know that many of the assertions he is making are untrue. And without knowing anything about Benjamin, his mental make-up, his family background, one cannot reach such conclusions that he was intimidated and that is why he took his life.",13,65,013-001-094-008-019-065,441

2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"People sometimes take their lives when they reach a point of hopelessness; they give up on life. What were the possible reasons Benjamin gave up on his life? This may involve having to look at, one, his mental state before the incident – depends on a variety of factors, surrounding circumstances, and the time period could stretch some way back, even years. One has to also consider what were the stressors in Benjamin's life before the incident. What led him to engage in this incident? If the behaviour was not normal, what was going on in his mind? Two, you look at the events on the day, including his conduct during the incident and the interview. And, three, the events after the interview, including his various interactions. So, there were many aspects to look at and it would not be accurate at all at this stage to fix on any one particular point and say with certainty that that was the reason why the suicide took place.",15,67,013-001-094-008-019-067,443
2016-03-01, Death of Student,013-001-094-008-019,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mdm Speaker, I have focused on Benjamin's case. Mr Thio and others have also referred to other issues, early access to counsel being one of them. On early access to counsel, there are reasonable arguments both ways. Our position on early access to counsel has been made clear previously. We had arrived at this position after thoroughly considering the matter and taking into account all the relevant factors. I am prepared to explain again our reasons and thinking behind this position in due course at a more appropriate time. Today, I would like to keep discussions to this case.",16,68,013-001-094-008-019-068,444

Assertions which go to the integrity of the Police Force have been repeated several times, including untrue factual assertions, and Members have filed many PQs. In these circumstances, not everyone will know why the Government has not responded and people may misunderstand if the Government did not respond. Thus, I decided, with some regret, and considerable reservation, and after consulting the AGC, that we will have to set out the facts and discuss the matter.",17,69,013-001-094-008-019-069,445

The rules of sub judice generally preclude discussions which may prejudice proceedings, but public officials like myself can make statements if they believe it to be necessary in the public interest, even if there is a hearing pending. I have myself commented on some occasions in the past, when a case is pending.

We must also avoid attacking institutions and individuals based on those hasty conclusions. We must allow the facts to be established first. This is Singapore.

Although not common, we have had murder; we have had physical assault; we have had young people being picked up for gang riotings and, if my memory serves me right, about maybe over 500 were picked up for rioting in the last five years, rioting involving serious gang activities. We have young people involved in unlicensed moneylending activities, particularly arson, and I think almost all Members would have come across that and how your residents fear for their safety. So, it presents a wide range of challenges.",1,39,013-001-094-008-020-039,493
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr K Shanmugam,"At the same time, our own research and approach show that, at a young age, the criminality or criminal conduct can, with the right approach, be such that it can be limited in time or limited by age. That is why we send a very large number − again, if my memory serves right − about 600 per year to guidance programmes where, in return for not proceeding with a charge, they have to undergo a six-month guidance programme, about 20-over sessions where they are taken through the need to understand the nature of the act involved, including the criminality, the impact on the community, how to manage themselves better in their social interactions. This is a programme that, in a way, of course, involves the AGC and MSF. The recidivism rate is only about 11%. That means 89% go on to lead crime-free lives.",2,40,013-001-094-008-020-040,494

But I have gone into this in my statement and suggested that we approach it with the facts known to the Police at that point in time. When they went down to the school on 26 January, they did not know who the boy was. They did not know what his antecedents were. Some may have been reported; some may not have been reported. If he had committed another molest, Members would be asking me ""Why did you not go down faster?""",1,43,013-001-094-008-020-043,497

But we have the right protocols on how a visit to a school should be handled. So, the Police went in plain clothes. There is a Protocol worked out with the Ministry of Education. You saw what happened here. The boy was brought to the Principal's office; he was interviewed in the presence of the educators, and then he was brought back to the Police Station in an unmarked car. So, as little possibility of publicity as possible. But move, we must. Unless as a society, we say that regardless of what happens, we should never go to the school. I do not think Members will think that is a right approach.",2,44,013-001-094-008-020-044,498
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"  I thank both the Ministers for their statements which reflect the solemn nature of this incident. My question or clarification is in relation to Protocol  was there a need for five officers to go down to the school? I appreciate that the three of the five were from NPC, but was there a need for three NPC officers?",1,45,013-001-094-008-020-045,499
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"I asked this clarification because I believe that the fundamental rationale for intervention where a youth offender is concerned is rehabilitation – to rehabilitate the youth. And importantly, in order to rehabilitate, one has to rehabilitate in his or her own peer group. For that purpose it was the school or one of the peer groups was the school. Therefore, was there a need to come to school in such numbers? And in order then for him to return to school to give him the best chance at rehabilitation. So, it is a question on Protocol and it is a question on Protocol going forward.",2,46,013-001-094-008-020-046,500
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr K Shanmugam,"  I thank Mr de Souza. I think the question is not so much focused on why five. Because I agree with Mr de Souza that the focus should be on rehabilitation and the impact on the boy. Therefore, you focus on how many spoke with him. One officer spoke with him. The three officers who went down from NPC were the bridges between the Police and the school. When they go down, the school is familiar with these officers. They are able to know who to go to, who to speak with. There are regular interactions between the NPC and that school. Not just that school – schools in the neighbourhood – and the communities. They are the bridges. They open the doors, they speak with the Principals, they speak with the teachers and they say this matter needs to be investigated, our officers from division are here. They smoothen the path. They were not present when the boy was interviewed. In fact, only one of the officers from the division was present. They went in unmarked cars in plain clothes. So, let us focus on what happened with the boy. He was interviewed by one officer.",1,47,013-001-094-008-020-047,501
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr K Shanmugam,"Now, I am not saying that one is always the right number. I think the point is, he must be interviewed in a way that is conducive for a fair, neutral approach to obtain the facts and obtain to the truth. I think that must be the fundamental aim. How you approach it, is something that ground officers should be given the discretion to decide on a case-by-case basis. I am not going to go into it and say, ""It should have been five or it should have been three or it should have been four"". I think those are ground decisions that we should leave to the officers. But we should look at it and we will certainly look at this case. What did the boy see? He saw one officer at first, and then three brought him back, one left the car so there were only two which is the minimum number that you will need in a car. And then he was interviewed by one officer in the division. So, you look at those facts.",2,48,013-001-094-008-020-048,502

I am not talking about the situation where the pupil is under interview, not at that stage. But what I am talking about is basically a member of the staff or allowing the parents to be at the Police Station but not during the interview so that at the very least there is some handing over between the school and the parents.",2,50,013-001-094-008-020-050,504

On the first point as to when the review would be completed; I have told my officials that we should start the work but we should hold back on any decisions until after the Coroner's Inquiry. Let the Coroner's Inquiry go through, let there be a finding, we will take reference from that. The second thing that we need to do and that is why I do not want to rush into it, is also maybe consult the stakeholders. I do not really want to start consulting stakeholders before the Coroner's Inquiry.",1,54,013-001-094-008-020-054,508
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr K Shanmugam,"So, we will review it and that will really cover the Member's second point because in a sense, the Member's point is, can there be an adult accompanying the young person from school until he gets to the Police Station? I think we will have to review those as part and parcel of this process. I have said earlier in my statement that we will consider the suggestion of the Appropriate Adult scheme but I also pointed out the many considerations and why it is not so straightforward and some of the people involved would not be considered vulnerable either. I gave you a range of cases and I gave you three major reasons why, one should take a pause before rushing to conclusions. So, those things have to be considered.",2,55,013-001-094-008-020-055,509
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr K Shanmugam,"I want to assure Members and Mr Tan on one thing. The reason why I gave you the statistics about 70% flowing through as it were without a charge. Some of them after investigations are not guilty, but some of them, would in Police view be people who have committed an offence. But why is it that seven out of 10 are not charged? It is, therefore, not a Police versus a young person situation. The Police look at it as a stakeholder in a community to try and make sure the young person gets rehabilitated. That is why we place a lot of emphasis on the Guidance Programme.",3,56,013-001-094-008-020-056,510
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr K Shanmugam,"We are very pleased with the results of the Guidance Programme at 89% success rate. Touch wood! But 11% recidivism. That means, you have really moved the young person from one path to another path. As Mr Tan would know from practice, many of those who turn up in prison in their early 20s would often have had minor infractions in their teens. The experience of criminality is a very strong indicator of subsequent life of crime. A life wasted. So, for us, the way we want to approach it is, lives saved.",4,57,013-001-094-008-020-057,511

I have given you the facts that we have got to consider, but that does not mean that we sit back and say we do nothing.

2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr K Shanmugam,"  First of all, the suggestion that this case would have died down long ago is ridiculous because there is going to be a Coroner's Inquiry. That is what normally happens when there is an unnatural death and an announcement was made on the 1 February, as I said, that is six days after the Police started investigating. On the sixth day. So, that is just absurd. But I am not saying that the father is saying absurd things; I do not want to assume that what I see in TOC is what the father says. But any such suggestion would be absurd.",1,61,013-001-094-008-020-061,515
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr K Shanmugam,"What I can say is what the father said to us. On 24 February last week, he had told us in the presence of a number of officers that the family would prefer to keep the Coroner's Inquiry private. They felt pressurised by the media. They would appreciate if police could inform the media not to publish the family's pictures or names, and I elaborated upon that in my statement.",2,62,013-001-094-008-020-062,516
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr K Shanmugam,"Mr Lim, the father, confirmed that yesterday with the Police. He told us yesterday that the family's earlier set of requests remained. He continued with the request that the media not harass him, that the family's privacy be respected and that the Coroner's Inquiry be held in private. That was yesterday, the same day the Member referred to this article coming out. Many possible explanations; I have not sought to ask why. Is it the case that the father is saying different things to different people? Or is it the case that, as usual, you cannot believe what you read on TOC? I do not know. Or could there be some other explanation? Your guess is as good as mine.",3,63,013-001-094-008-020-063,517
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"  I would like to express my condolences to the family of Benjamin Lim. I also thank the Ministers for taking this case seriously to issue the statements. My question is about the Appropriate Adult scheme. Notwithstanding the fact that it could be an imperfect scheme, I would like to ask the Minister to consider extending the scope of this current scheme. Currently, it covers persons with mental and intellectual disability only. In regimes like in the United Kingdom, the scope covers young people who are less than 18 years of age and also vulnerable adults who might have mental wellness issues or even dementia or other learning disabilities. So, I would like to ask the Minister to consider this.",1,64,013-001-094-008-020-064,518
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"The second question is  the current Appropriate Adult scheme in Singapore is manned by volunteers and run by charities. I think the scheme is important enough for the State to allocate some resources to ensure that at least people who are trained, not just trained for a short while only, people who are professionals, can operate the scheme on a sustainable basis. This is for Minister's consideration, please.",2,65,013-001-094-008-020-065,519
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr K Shanmugam,"  I assume on the second question, what the Member is really asking is whether we will pay for it. Yes, that is something that we would look at. I cannot give a guarantee on that but we will certainly look at.",1,66,013-001-094-008-020-066,520
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr K Shanmugam,"On the first point, I have already said that both in my statement and in answer to Mr Tan's question, that the review would cover this particular aspect as whether an Appropriate Adult should be present when young persons are interviewed. But I have taken some considerable pains to point out why it is not a straightforward issue and what are possible issues that might arise.",2,67,013-001-094-008-020-067,521
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr K Shanmugam,"We have to balance between the need to move quickly, investigate particularly when it is a serious crime a terrorism-related issue, and balance that against the need for the young person to have some support. I have mentioned the systemic risk could be minimised as well. We will try but I just want to be very open and clear and transparent about our considerations as we look at this.",3,68,013-001-094-008-020-068,522

2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"  Thank you, Madam. As a parent of two teenagers, I deeply empathise with the families of both the deceased and the victim. For the Minister for Home Affairs, I understand the urgency the Police had in interviewing the deceased, but could the Police not have waited another half or one hour until Benjamin's father or mother came to the Police Station or the school before starting to interview him? Like what the Minister mentioned earlier, this is his first offence. He did not have any prior record, and as a 14-year-old whom I still regard as a child, he must have felt quite frightened to be there being interviewed by the Police without a significant adult present.",1,71,013-001-094-008-020-071,525
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),"The other question  there are many speculations, accusations and unverified accounts on social media sites. In future, will the Ministry be more responsive and open to sharing more information in both print and online news media so as to make verifications or to dispel the accusations that are floating around?",2,72,013-001-094-008-020-072,526
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr K Shanmugam,"  I think the first question essentially raises the question whether we should have an Appropriate Adult present. What I have said is we had considered a lot of that very carefully previously and I have explained in my statement the considerations. And I have said that we will review. We will do a review. We will look at the findings in the Coroner's Inquiry. We will consult stakeholders and we will decide. I have explained why we should not have knee-jerk reactions. I think I should express, as the Minister for Education has expressed, our condolences to Benjamin's family. And equally, we share the grief of the family of the 11-year-old girl because they are also grief-stricken. I think they all have the same feelings. As I said in my statement, either child could have been a child of any of us. We got to approach it with that perspective.",1,73,013-001-094-008-020-073,527
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr K Shanmugam,"At the same time, whether the Police should wait for the parents or somebody else to accompany, whether there should be someone else present, I think these are the same type of questions that Ms Denise Phua and Mr Dennis Tan have raised and which I myself have raised in my statement. We will review it.",2,74,013-001-094-008-020-074,528
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr K Shanmugam,"On the second point as to whether we will release more information, I have spent quite a bit of time explaining why in this case we actually decided not to go into the facts. I think it would be unseemly for this matter to get to a stage where there are series of allegations and counter allegations, and statements and counter statements with the families, the commentators, the Police – you will have a ""free for all"". That is precisely what legal proceedings are destined to avoid. We will have a proper process for finding out the facts. Otherwise, who is to say my truth is superior to your truth? I think we were right, we were observing the law but others were not so careful. In fact, they were cavalier and which has then required us to come out today and clarify.",3,75,013-001-094-008-020-075,529

2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr K Shanmugam,"  I thank Ms Tan for that. But that sort of reverses the onus. It is not for them to make the allegations and then for us to respond. The law is the same on reporting before a pending hearing or inquiry, whether it is a physical world or online world, the law contempt is the same. Everyone should observe it. Just because you are online does not mean that you get a free pass and you can say what you like. So, we start with what is the law. As I said, you can raise some general issues; you can raise the issue of policy, whether in the media, physical media, print media, broadcast media or online media. What you cannot do is to make allegations of fact when those facts could be the subject matter of dispute or have to be found in an inquiry or would necessarily be part of what an inquiry would have to decide. It is even egregious when they are a bunch of lies.",1,77,013-001-094-008-020-077,531
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr K Shanmugam,"I think the starting point is people who want to express their view have to be responsible and the law requires them to be responsible.

2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"If you look at the process of the school, they would ensure that the well-being of the student is first taken care when the Police moves the child or student to the Police Station. And in the process, there would be no further contact between the school staff and the student. So, in the process of movement, the Police will be with the student in the Police car.

2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"  A question for Minister to let me understand the Protocol a bit better  at the moment, do the Principals of the schools have any discretion at all to decide whether or not to release their pupils for questioning by the Police in school or to the custody of the Police? If they do have such discretion, perhaps the Minister could share with us what are some of the guidelines for this discretion.",1,85,013-001-094-008-020-085,539
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong,"The second question is more of a suggestion for your current review is that, would the Ministry consider requiring the Principals to inform the parents of any pupil immediately upon the arrival of the Police at the school to interview the pupil or to take the pupil into custody, rather than to advise or inform the Police to inform the parents.",2,86,013-001-094-008-020-086,540
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"  I thank the Member for the questions. In the current process, the Principals under the law have no such discretion. When the Police invites or takes someone for an interview, it is up to the Police to decide where and when the interview would take place. But over time, the schools and the Police have worked together to ensure that the well-being of the students are taking care of.",1,87,013-001-094-008-020-087,541
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"On the second part, each incident is unique and at what stage the Principal would get the student to call the parents will all be contextualised. In this particular instance, where the interview was in a calm manner, the whole eight-step process could carry through as what I have articulated. But in certain instances and context, you would understand that real ground processes may be somewhat more flexible.",2,88,013-001-094-008-020-088,542
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"And also in answer to the Member's earlier question, the Minister for Home Affairs has pretty much answered most of it. I would just like to emphasise that we are open to review and adapt our processes where needed to make sure that the students could be accompanied if the review conclusions allow us to do so.",3,89,013-001-094-008-020-089,543
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"  I thank both Ministers for the clarifications. Firstly, my condolences to the family of Benjamin Lim for the passing of their son. My question is this  for MOE, how many times in the past three years, has the same Protocols been applied in the schools? Secondly, in terms of the impact to the students, has there been any adverse impact to students and their parents? Has MOE received any feedback or comments from parents with regards to this Protocol, where Police comes to the school to do investigations?",1,90,013-001-094-008-020-090,544
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"And thirdly, what measures are in place in schools to help students – I think ""rehabilitation"" is the key word used earlier – rehabilitate and integrate back into school life once investigations are over? I am sure in this era of social media, friends will talk and if it goes around, there will be other implications. And specifically, for this particular case, did the school interview friends? I suppose in schools, cyber bullying is one aspect, other aspects is rumours and other things that go round in social media or on their own Whatsapp or social media platforms. Was there such evidence that this may have happened that led to his choice of actions?",2,91,013-001-094-008-020-091,545
2016-03-01,Students Under Investigation,013-001-094-008-020,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"  Mdm Speaker, let me take the last question first. At this stage, we do not yet know the reasons for Benjamin's decision to end his life – whether it is social media or other factors – it is premature to make any conclusions. So, I will just leave it as that.",1,92,013-001-094-008-020-092,546

This is not an insignificant target given that all local farms currently produce only 8% of all the vegetables consumed in Singapore. While Panasonic's crops are currently grown in a soil-based environment as opposed to soilless methods that have been gaining popularity, the company is looking into R&D to boost yield, including vertical farming which utilises vertically stacked racks for space optimisation.",5,7,013-001-094-008-022-007,573

We should recall that indoor vertical farming is a high-tech, knowledge-intensive activity that requires the integration of many different types of expertise. Singapore, as a developed country with limited land and high population density, offers a good test bed. If economic development agencies adopted a proactive approach of grooming local Singapore-based SMEs to develop leading-edge technology and know-how in indoor farming, Singapore could be producing an even higher share of our consumption needs and developing an exportable sector that could contribute to our economy.",10,12,013-001-094-008-022-012,578

2016-03-01,Growing New Industries that Promise Economic and Non-economic Benefits,013-001-094-008-022,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The benefits of underground vertical farming are, essentially, three-fold. Firstly, food security. Underground indoor farming promises to protect our food supply from catastrophic events, security threats, crop disease and so on. As for affordability, new technologies have enabled higher crop yields for indoor farming. Sky Greens, for example, has been able to produce at least 10 times more yield per unit of land area versus conventional methods and the world's biggest indoor farm in Japan has claimed to be 100 times more productive than traditional farms. Certainly, not all our food supply can come from underground vertical farming; there are still price differences but it is moving in a positive direction.",14,16,013-001-094-008-022-016,582
2016-03-01,Growing New Industries that Promise Economic and Non-economic Benefits,013-001-094-008-022,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Secondly, sustainability. The amount of water used in indoor vertical farming has been found to be substantially lower due to the layout of the racks and the implementation of water recycling features built into the system. The underground farm in London uses 70% less water than traditional farming. Indoor farming also reduces shrinkage, which is loss of crops during transportation. The much-shorter journey from the farm to the marketplace also means that the crops remain fresh for longer periods after they reach our shelves.",15,17,013-001-094-008-022-017,583
2016-03-01,Growing New Industries that Promise Economic and Non-economic Benefits,013-001-094-008-022,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"The third benefit is developing expertise and IP for our economy. Singapore is well-positioned to become a global leader in the field of underground urban agriculture. Our local enterprises can be nurtured to not only operate indoor farms effectively in Singapore for the benefit of Singapore and Singaporeans, but also to cultivate expertise in designing, installing, implementing and managing such facilities in similar high-density urban environments around the world.

In this regard we are fortunate that most housing in Singapore is public housing, which facilitates the achievement of this goal. In October 2014, HDB began awarding the zero-dollar solar leasing tender, meaning that the full costs of solar PV systems are borne by the PV developers. In June 2015, HDB called the first consolidated tender under the SolarNova programme for 220MWp, which is a small fraction of the estimated 6GWp of solar capacity that is potentially available, according to estimates in Singapore. This initiative was leading to the installation of solar panels at some 5,500 HDB blocks. We can be more aggressive here and set a goal to install solar panels on every HDB building roof by 2025.",24,26,013-001-094-008-022-026,592

The PUB has been looking into building solar panels on the Tengeh reservoir and Choa Chu Kang waterworks. One that is being built in the UK – that is, water-borne solar panel deployment – is reported to cost about £3.5 million, about S$7 million, and will generate around 3 MW. The UK deployment covers an area about half the size of Bedok reservoir, which is one of our smaller reservoirs. Solar panel deployments across all our reservoirs, and also some available parts of our territorial waters outside of established sea lanes, could contribute significantly to energy production.

Before filing an injunction application in the courts, CASE may facilitate mediation between suppliers and consumers to reach mutually agreed outcomes. CASE may also propose that suppliers enter into voluntary compliance agreements (VCAs) to stop the specified unfair practices and compensate consumers. In most cases, errant retailers cease the unfair practices after mediation and/or entering into a VCA. In such instances, CASE does not need to file for injunctions against them. Over the same period, from 2005 to 2015, CASE facilitated about 1,700 mediation cases and entered into 17 VCAs.",2,3,013-001-094-008-037-003,683
