2013-09-16,Relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase,012-001-090-022-003,Dr Lim Wee Kiak,"asked	the Minister for Defence in light of the relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase, how will the Government maintain the Republic of Singapore Air Force's operational readiness and ensure that Singapore's security needs will not be compromised.",1,1,012-001-090-022-003-001,11
2013-09-16,Relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase,012-001-090-022-003,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"  Mdm Speaker, the Member Dr Lim Wee Kiak has asked a highly relevant question as the relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase (PLAB) must never compromise the ability of the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) to safeguard Singapore's security and sovereignty.",1,2,012-001-090-022-003-002,12
2013-09-16,Relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase,012-001-090-022-003,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"Indeed, this was the over-riding and primary consideration when MINDEF and the SAF studied the possibility of relocating PLAB. We were mindful that the current capabilities of the RSAF were achieved over four decades and remain critical to protect a small country like Singapore which lacks strategic depth.",2,3,012-001-090-022-003-003,13
2013-09-16,Relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase,012-001-090-022-003,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"The RSAF's superior air defence and strike capabilities have been built up through prudent and steady investments of resources and land allocation for our defence needs. Over the years, we have acquired, adapted and developed advanced technologies and state-of-the-art platforms to provide more accurate and timely early warning and situational awareness of potential threats. We will continue to invest in these capabilities.",3,4,012-001-090-022-003-004,14
2013-09-16,Relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase,012-001-090-022-003,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"In particular, the RSAF is putting into place a state-of-art multi-layered Island Air Defence System to provide a comprehensive shield protecting Singapore against airborne threats. This includes at the outer perimeter, our existing Gulfstream-550 Airborne Early Warning aircraft, which replaced the E2C in 2012, and significantly enhanced our early warning and air defence capabilities through its better endurance and longer range of detection.",4,5,012-001-090-022-003-005,15
2013-09-16,Relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase,012-001-090-022-003,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"I would like to announce today that the SAF will also be acquiring the ASTER-30 Surface-to-Air Missile System. This missile defence system against airborne threats is used by advanced militaries such as France and Italy. The ASTER-30's capabilities are many times more potent than our current I-HAWK ground-based air defence system. The ASTER will allow us to engage multiple threats simultaneously and from a longer distance. It will complement the SPYDER, which we have already operationalised – it is a mobile, shorter range, quick reaction ground-based air defence system – and together, they will provide a layered air defence shield.",5,6,012-001-090-022-003-006,16
2013-09-16,Relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase,012-001-090-022-003,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"The RSAF will also be looking to upgrade its fighter fleet. We plan to upgrade our F16s to modernise their avionics and extend their lifespan. Our F15SGs were recently acquired and have proven themselves in recent multilateral military exercises with advanced Air Forces like those from the US and Australia during Exercise Cope Tiger and Exercise Pitch Black. Also, as announced at the Committee of Supply in March this year, we are evaluating the suitability of the advanced multi-role F-35 Joint Strike Fighter in meeting our long-term security needs to further modernise our fighter fleet and replace our older aircraft.",6,7,012-001-090-022-003-007,17
2013-09-16,Relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase,012-001-090-022-003,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"These advanced capabilities that I have mentioned have been built up through steady defence investments over the years, and have now provided the confidence for MINDEF and the SAF to consider relocating PLAB in the long term to meet national development needs.",7,8,012-001-090-022-003-008,18
2013-09-16,Relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase,012-001-090-022-003,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"In 2011, MINDEF and the SAF conducted a thorough assessment of our capabilities and security threats for the long term. We satisfied ourselves that our security would not be compromised and that relocation of PLAB could take place after existing airbases at Changi East (CAB) and Tengah (TAB) have been expanded to accommodate relocated assets and facilities.",8,9,012-001-090-022-003-009,19
2013-09-16,Relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase,012-001-090-022-003,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"The expansion of CAB and TAB will be necessary to house relocated fighter and support squadrons as well as accommodate facilities currently housed in PLAB. As Members would recognise, this undertaking is complex but the RSAF will use this opportunity to build anew through innovative operational concepts and advanced airbase designs, which will enhance the effectiveness and resilience of the airbases. Newly expanded and improved airbases together with advanced fighter fleets protected by a multi-layered air defence shield will ensure that the RSAF maintains its deterrent edge and continues to be an effective and formidable Air Force.",9,10,012-001-090-022-003-010,20
2013-09-16,Relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase,012-001-090-022-003,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),PLAB's relocation will be a long-term and complex undertaking. MINDEF will be working closely with MND on the detailed planning and implementation of the relocation over the next two decades.,10,11,012-001-090-022-003-011,21
2013-09-16,Relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase,012-001-090-022-003,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Nee Soon),"  Mdm Speaker, let me thank the Minister for his comprehensive answer. I would like to ask the Minister  does this relocation change the order of battle (orbat) of the entire Air Force and what is the estimated cost of the entire relocation?",1,12,012-001-090-022-003-012,22
2013-09-16,Relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase,012-001-090-022-003,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"  First, I would say that Paya Lebar Airbase's relocation is a long-term plan. It does not in any way affect current operations or manning at PLAB. Dr Lim asked for orbat. I would say that generally, the answer is no. It does not affect the orbat. We will continue to modernise our air fleets, as I have said. I also announced that we are currently looking at the F-35s. We will take our time because that is a long-term need.",1,13,012-001-090-022-003-013,23
2013-09-16,Relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase,012-001-090-022-003,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"He also asked for cost. It will be costly because it is a complex undertaking that will require fairly intense and sometimes highly skilled engineering to accommodate some of the facilities. In coming to this decision, we have worked together with MND to calculate the trade-offs, and on balance, because of the space that is released from the relocated Paya Lebar Airbase, including the height templates around it, on a nett basis, it is many billion dollars worth of positive returns to the people of Singapore. That is the basis on which we have made the decision.",2,14,012-001-090-022-003-014,24
2013-09-16,Relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase,012-001-090-022-003,Mr Nicholas Fang (Nominated Member),"  Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I would like to ask the Minister if there is a potential in the future for all our airbase facilities to be consolidated in a possible location, and what are the factors that might actually contribute to us consolidating them in that way.",1,15,012-001-090-022-003-015,25
2013-09-16,Relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase,012-001-090-022-003,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"  As I have said in my reply, we took a very detailed study of this possibility just to relocate Paya Lebar Airbase. I am not at liberty to release all the classified information that we looked at, but it was a balance between our ability to preserve RSAF's capabilities and to protect Singapore. It is not our intent to squeeze our defence assets to the most efficient because there is the issue of ability of operational needs. This configuration, with an expanded Changi Airbase and expanded Tengah Airbase, fulfils those needs.",1,16,012-001-090-022-003-016,26
2013-09-16,Relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase,012-001-090-022-003,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Already, the relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase is a long-term initiative and we have given this a timeline of perhaps around 2030. This will serve us for the longer term and there are no plans and no studies to even further consolidate.",2,17,012-001-090-022-003-017,27
2013-09-16,Relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase,012-001-090-022-003,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"  Mdm Speaker, I thank the Minister for the announcement that the HAWK system would be upgraded. I am a HAWK officer. In fact, a whole squadron of men and women has been dedicated to manning the system for many years. Therefore, my question is, how much overlap would there be to ensure that a whole squadron of men and women are equipped with the new upgraded system that the Minister talked about.",1,18,012-001-090-022-003-018,28
2013-09-16,Relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase,012-001-090-022-003,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"  Mdm Speaker, first, let me thank the Member Christopher de Souza for protecting our skies through the HAWK system. We will ensure that officers like him and units which are caught in the transition will be smoothly transitioned to new systems. We have done it before, as we did with SPYDER that replaced various other systems. This is not the first time that we have changed systems. I am confident that we will put in the gears smoothly.",1,19,012-001-090-022-003-019,29
2013-09-16,Discovery of Empty Ballot Boxes,012-001-090-022-004,Mr Pritam Singh,"asked the Prime Minister in light of the discovery of used election ballot boxes that were not disposed of in a proper manner (a) who was responsible for the lapse and what action has been taken against the person; (b) whether these boxes were for the 2011 presidential election and, if so, whether there was any breach of section 37 of the Presidential Elections Act; (c) whether there were any other ballot boxes or presidential election paraphernalia that were similarly mishandled in the course of the presidential election; and (d) what role does the Elections Department play in ensuring that such episodes do not occur and what oversight responsibilities does the Elections Department have over their appointed contractors.",1,1,012-001-090-022-004-001,30
2013-09-16,Discovery of Empty Ballot Boxes,012-001-090-022-004,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing) (for the Prime Minister),"  Mdm Speaker, I understand that Mr Alex Yam had also filed a similar question for a subsequent sitting.",1,2,012-001-090-022-004-002,31
2013-09-16,Discovery of Empty Ballot Boxes,012-001-090-022-004,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing) (for the Prime Minister),"Let me first assure Members of the House that the discovery of used empty ballot boxes does not constitute a lapse in the election procedures that ensure the integrity of the election process. There is a rigorous process to ensure security of the vote and voting secrecy at each election. There is no break in the chain of custody of ballot papers from the polling station to the counting centre, and from the counting centre to the Supreme Court where the ballot papers are retained in safe custody for six months and then subsequently destroyed. For transparency, the process is open to observation by candidates and their agents who are present.",2,3,012-001-090-022-004-003,32
2013-09-16,Discovery of Empty Ballot Boxes,012-001-090-022-004,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing) (for the Prime Minister),"Ballot boxes are boxes so designated and used for the deposit of ballots cast in an election on Polling Day. These boxes are marked and are shown to be empty to candidates and their polling agents who are present before they are sealed by election officials at the polling station before the start of the polls on Polling Day. These boxes are treated from this point as controlled items for use for the casting of ballots. After the polls have closed, election officials at the polling station seal these ballot boxes containing the ballot papers which have been cast. Candidates and their polling agents who are present witness the process and may also place their own seals on the ballot boxes. The sealed ballot boxes carried by the election officials are then transported under Police escort to the counting centre. A Police officer is on board the bus used and stands guard over the ballot boxes throughout the journey.",3,4,012-001-090-022-004-004,33
2013-09-16,Discovery of Empty Ballot Boxes,012-001-090-022-004,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing) (for the Prime Minister),"At the counting centre, before the ballot boxes are opened, candidates and their counting agents who are present may inspect all the boxes again to ascertain that all the boxes are accounted for, and that no others are present; and that the seals of all the ballot boxes are intact and have not been tampered with. The seals are then broken and ballot boxes are opened, and the ballot papers therein are poured out, sorted and counted. The emptied ballot boxes are ascertained in the presence of all to be empty and cease to be a controlled item and are put aside with other discarded material to be later collected by the Elections Department (ELD)'s contractor for general disposal.",4,5,012-001-090-022-004-005,34
2013-09-16,Discovery of Empty Ballot Boxes,012-001-090-022-004,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing) (for the Prime Minister),"After the election result has been announced by the Returning Officer, the ballot papers and other official documents used in the election are placed into separate boxes and sealed, witnessed by candidates and their counting agents who are present, who may also place their own seals on these boxes. These boxes are then conveyed by Police escort and retained in safe custody for six months at the Supreme Court. After six months, they are destroyed by incineration, unless directed by order of the President.",5,6,012-001-090-022-004-006,35
2013-09-16,Discovery of Empty Ballot Boxes,012-001-090-022-004,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing) (for the Prime Minister),"The empty ballot boxes set aside at the counting centres, along with other paraphernalia like disused writing material, emergency lanterns and any other equipment and leftover general items are supposed to be collected by a contractor appointed by ELD from the counting centres the day after Polling Day. In the event that the contractor is unable to collect all or any of these items the day after Polling Day, such items are then kept in the storeroom for the contractor to collect on another date. The used and empty boxes and other debris collected are disposed of by the contractor. This arrangement has been in place for years over several elections without issue.",6,7,012-001-090-022-004-007,36
2013-09-16,Discovery of Empty Ballot Boxes,012-001-090-022-004,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing) (for the Prime Minister),"The fact that some boxes were recently found clearly suggests an oversight by working personnel on the ground involved in the collection of such discarded material after Polling Day. Although, as I had explained, this does not constitute a lapse in the election process proper, I have directed ELD to study how such an incident can be prevented in future to avoid undue alarm or confusion. However, such a tightened process to ensure disposal of such discarded material and debris should be practical and not onerous.",7,8,012-001-090-022-004-008,37
2013-09-16,Discovery of Empty Ballot Boxes,012-001-090-022-004,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing) (for the Prime Minister),"Following this incident, ELD has also since checked with all the 164 schools that were used as counting centres to see if there are any other such discarded empty used ballot boxes or other similarly non-controlled election paraphernalia or items kept in their stores. They have since found several such disused boxes in the stores of five schools used as counting centres. These will be collected by the contractor for general disposal.",8,9,012-001-090-022-004-009,38
2013-09-16,Discovery of Empty Ballot Boxes,012-001-090-022-004,The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing) (for the Prime Minister),"Member of Parliament Mr Pritam Singh asked whether there is any breach of section 37 of the Presidential Elections Act with regards to this specific case. The investigation by the Police thus far shows that there is no offence disclosed under section 37 of the Act, which relates to the tampering of ballot boxes before and while in use, but investigations continue as to the unauthorised removal of these disused boxes from a locked storeroom.",9,10,012-001-090-022-004-010,39
2013-09-16,Discovery of Empty Ballot Boxes,012-001-090-022-004,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"  I would like to thank the Minister for the comprehensive reply and the detail at which the Minister went through the elections process proper. Coming to my question, I refer to the press release by ELD on 30 August, where it was stated that ballot papers and other documents used in the elections, are placed into separate boxes and sealed for safe custody at the Supreme Court and then six months later, for disposal. Can I ask the Minister if these other documents include spare ballot boxes and their locked down form and if the other documents used in the elections are to be placed in separate boxes and sealed for disposal, are there any other election related items that are also similarly disposed by the appointed contractor?",1,11,012-001-090-022-004-011,40
2013-09-16,Discovery of Empty Ballot Boxes,012-001-090-022-004,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"  The answer to the first question is no. They are not the same boxes and there are no other things that are similarly in that category. For the disposed items, or what we call, the non-controlled items would be collected by the contractor for subsequent disposal. This may include other writing materials that are non-controlled items. At no point in time is any controlled item being mixed or left unattended.",1,12,012-001-090-022-004-012,41
2013-09-16,Discovery of Empty Ballot Boxes,012-001-090-022-004,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The entire process is controlled and carefully watched from the beginning of the polls until the boxes are emptied out. Once the boxes are emptied out, the boxes cease to be called election boxes. They will be known as discarded boxes and the boxes that are used to store the materials for safe keeping at the Supreme Court is a different set of boxes.",2,13,012-001-090-022-004-013,42
2013-09-16,Discovery of Empty Ballot Boxes,012-001-090-022-004,Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang),"  Mdm Speaker, I thank the Minister for his reply. Two supplementary questions, please. One, is this the first time such an incident has occurred and whether there were previous examples of these? The second is that section 49 of the Parliamentary Elections Act has a list of required steps for the disposal of items. Of course this does not include the non-controlled items at the moment. I am wondering if the Ministry would consider the inclusion of additional items under this schedule.",1,14,012-001-090-022-004-014,43
2013-09-16,Discovery of Empty Ballot Boxes,012-001-090-022-004,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"  Mdm Speaker, let me first clarify the difference between controlled items and non-controlled items. In this particular case, the empty disused boxes are non-controlled items. For the ELD, the priority is to ensure that all controlled items, for example, ballot papers are properly accounted for and this, we have done so over the course of the election.",1,15,012-001-090-022-004-015,44
2013-09-16,Discovery of Empty Ballot Boxes,012-001-090-022-004,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The other question is whether there had been any previous instances whereby non-controlled items were similarly found. We are unaware of this but following this incident, we have done a thorough check on all the counting centres and indeed, we found there were some non-controlled items that were not collected by the contractors, and we will tighten up this process even though they are non-controlled items.",2,16,012-001-090-022-004-016,45
2013-09-16,Discovery of Empty Ballot Boxes,012-001-090-022-004,Mr Pritam Singh,"  I thank the Minister for the reply. As the Minister suggested in the initial response that he gave, some people were unduly alarmed at the presence of the spare boxes being discovered. To avoid this sort of alarm in future, would the Minister, depending on the Police investigations and other discussions that take place with regard to the incident, consider including spare boxes as controlled items in future elections?",1,17,012-001-090-022-004-017,46
2013-09-16,Discovery of Empty Ballot Boxes,012-001-090-022-004,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"  Mdm Speaker, let me say it once again. Spare boxes are not controlled items. The life span of a controlled item in this case, the box, starts from the moment before the polling starts, whereby in the presence of the election officials, the candidates and all their agents, they are shown the empty boxes. The life of the box starts once the box is sealed with the proper seal and then from that point onwards, it is known as a controlled item with the seal under the watch of the election officials all the way until the counting centre.",1,18,012-001-090-022-004-018,47
2013-09-16,Discovery of Empty Ballot Boxes,012-001-090-022-004,Mr Chan Chun Sing,The life of the ballot box ceases when the seal is broken and the ballot papers are emptied out and the box is certified to be totally empty. That will be the end of the life of the ballot box.,2,19,012-001-090-022-004-019,48
2013-09-16,Discovery of Empty Ballot Boxes,012-001-090-022-004,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"As to whether we would include the unused boxes as controlled items, we will take this issue and study it with ELD. But I must emphasise again, unused boxes are not controlled items. The Member's question is whether ELD will include them as a controlled item, but these boxes are just like any other box.",3,20,012-001-090-022-004-020,49

The Singaporean families, especially those who already qualified for the CHAS card, would greatly benefit from the streamlined process. I have a supplementary question for the Minister. If a CHAS eligible household suffers a drop in the household income within the two-year validity period – say from $1,500 to $900 per capita household monthly income either because of loss of employment or due to changes in household members' employment – would the Minister consider upgrading the CHAS subsidy level from orange to blue?",1,5,012-001-090-022-005-005,55
2013-09-16,Qualification Criteria for Community Health Assist Scheme,012-001-090-022-005,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"  The answer is yes. Please apply and we will review on a case-by-case basis. If the income has indeed dropped, we will give you an upgrade to the blue card. The idea is that this card eventually aims to help the low-income and the middle income and if you need help, we will try our best to help.",1,6,012-001-090-022-005-006,56

2013-09-16,Projected Increase in MediShield Payouts,012-001-090-022-006,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member),"  Madam, I have three supplementary questions. First, my concern is that the increased coverage will also come with higher premiums. While I support the increased coverage, my concern is that these higher premiums will be a financial burden on some members, especially the elderly and the low income. So, my questions are  is the Government planning to subsidise MediShield Life premiums as part of its overall plan to increase the healthcare budget, because currently MediShield is completely self-funding and receives no Government subsidies? Secondly, can the Government provide more details about the Pioneer Generation Package that was announced during the National Day Rally? Would it be means tested and what is the cut-off age? Lastly, when will the full details of MediShield Life be announced?",1,4,012-001-090-022-006-004,65
2013-09-16,Projected Increase in MediShield Payouts,012-001-090-022-006,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"  Mdm Speaker, first let me explain that today, the Government already indirectly subsidises MediShield because the Government provides top-ups into Medisave, and Medisave is being used to pay for the premium for MediShield. So, indirectly there is Government subsidy for MediShield, particularly for the lower income. Going forward, with MediShield Life, as the Member has rightly pointed out, with enhanced benefits, the pay-outs will increase and that is the objective of enhancing the benefits, and therefore the premium has to go up as well.",1,5,012-001-090-022-006-005,66
2013-09-16,Projected Increase in MediShield Payouts,012-001-090-022-006,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Government is very conscious about the impact of higher premiums and therefore, we have already made the commitment that we will make sure that the lower income as well as older Singaporeans who may not have sufficient savings, will be looked after. We will make sure that the premiums, with Government subsidies, will be affordable for them. That is the first question.",2,6,012-001-090-022-006-006,67

2013-09-16,Projected Increase in MediShield Payouts,012-001-090-022-006,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Last question is about the details of MediShield Life. We will have a public consultation. We are still working on MediShield Life and what form it will take. But the key parameter is that we want to make sure that all Singaporeans will be included and they will also be included throughout their lives.

My question to Minister is  what are the details of the public consultation that Ministry is currently conducting, because it has just completed one public consultation before it has come up with this plan to include these others who were previously not included. The second is  when will MediShield Life be expected to be implemented, because there are quite a number of Singaporeans who are currently not receiving any basic health insurance at the moment?",1,10,012-001-090-022-006-010,71

In fact, the consultation is ongoing. So, we consult the public on many issues including Medisave, MediShield, as well as how we can help them with the medical costs in general. This coming public consultation is aimed specifically at MediShield Life and what the features are, and how do we make sure that it is practical and meaningful to the man in the street, to the patients who need help, and what are the features and the costs involved.

For now, until we implement MediShield Life, for those who are excluded currently, if they still need help in terms of financial support, they can approach our hospitals or public health institutions and we have schemes to help them, especially for the lower income and, for the older Singaporeans. So, help is available even before MediShield Life comes into being, but with MediShield Life, they will have greater assurance that their healthcare bills will be covered by insurance.",4,14,012-001-090-022-006-014,75

Post-National Day Rally discussions with the residents in Ulu Pandan have received warm acceptance for us taking care of the Pioneer Generation. My question is  many of them are advanced in years and, therefore, many would have pre-existing conditions. Would we try to keep premiums low, even for those who have pre-existing conditions, and also spread it out for those younger than that? Would the Minister do his best to keep premiums low? That is really the nub.",1,15,012-001-090-022-006-015,76
2013-09-16,Projected Increase in MediShield Payouts,012-001-090-022-006,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"  The short answer is yes, we will try our best to keep the premiums low and affordable. The Government will pay particular attention to those who are in the lower income group and those who are elderly who may no longer be working, and also may not have accumulated sufficient savings because they might have started work many, many years ago. And during those years, their incomes were limited. These people belong to the group we call the Pioneer Generation.

The legal requirements and administrative processes for selecting NMPs for appointment by the President are laid out in the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution which was drafted after extensive consultation and debates. This was in 1989−1990 when then Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong moved the Constitution Amendment Bill to provide for NMPs in this Parliament. The Bill was referred to a Select Committee to examine in detail the merits and demerits of various modes of selecting NMPs including the question which the Member has asked today, that is, whether the process should be made more public.",1,2,012-001-090-022-007-002,80

Revealing the names of unsuccessful candidates may give rise to speculation and public debate on their suitability. It may also cause those who are not appointed discomfort or embarrassment. This may deter potential good applicants from participating in the NMP process in the future. Other Parliaments also approach this matter in the same way.

2013-09-16,Housing Options for Divorcees with No Children,012-001-090-022-009,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"  I would like to thank the Minister of State for his very comprehensive reply on the options that are available to this group of Singaporeans. I have two supplementary questions. The first is considering the new BTO for Singles Scheme, could I clarify whether this particular group of single divorcees with no custody of their children can be considered also as first-timers or will they only be considered as second-timers? The second question is with regards to the debarment period for rental housing. For some of them who may not be prepared or be in a state to apply to buy a house – whether it is resale or BTO – whether the debarment period for rental housing for this particular group of low-income or single divorcees can be further lowered.",1,6,012-001-090-022-009-006,98
2013-09-16,Housing Options for Divorcees with No Children,012-001-090-022-009,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"  Mdm Speaker, for the first question, on whether we regard divorcees as first- or second-timer, it really depends on whether they have been tagged as having taken the first subsidy on their matrimonial home. Sometimes, they may have purchased a home but not tagged as a residential occupier or as a first-timer. As long as they are first-timers at the point of divorce, then they are eligible to purchase the 2-room BTO flats that we just allowed for singles, and they have to meet the eligibility criteria like age and income.",1,7,012-001-090-022-009-007,99
2013-09-16,Housing Options for Divorcees with No Children,012-001-090-022-009,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Secondly, on the issue of whether the debarment period for divorcees for rental flats can be reduced or waived, it really depends first on whether they have custody of the children. We are more sympathetic towards to divorcees who do have custody of the children and when they form a family nucleus. They are bound by the demand debarment, but we have seen cases that require some further assistance and we are prepared to look at those. If they do not have custody of the children, we treat them as singles and we hope that they can also try to look for housing options on their own. If they are above 35 years of age, they can always apply for rental flats under the Joint Singles Scheme.",2,8,012-001-090-022-009-008,100

2013-09-16,HDB Rental Flat Applicants,012-001-090-022-010,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"  Madam, affordability is also dependent on the family's capability in budgeting their income and expenditure. We try to help them in various ways  first, we do financial counselling for the families, especially on how they manage their expenses, and depending on the number of children they may have. The current pricing or fees for rental flats are already heavily subsidised. We try to allocate them to the truly needy. We do have criteria in place, for example, the household income criterion. But we do take into consideration the number of children in the family. As far as possible, we have a broad guideline in relation to the criteria that we put in place for families who are eligible for rental flats, but beyond that, we look at individual cases and try to help them as far as possible to be allocated rental flats when they really, truly need them.",1,7,012-001-090-022-010-007,107

I do see that some blocks still have empty units of rental flats. And so, in view of the high demand for rental flats, how can the Ministry expeditiously allocate these flats out?",1,8,012-001-090-022-010-008,108
2013-09-16,HDB Rental Flat Applicants,012-001-090-022-010,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"  Madam, as I have mentioned earlier, we have a stock of 50,000 rental flats, of which 48,200 have been allocated. We have about 1,300 rental flats that are awaiting allocation. It is an on-going number because there are rental flats that are returned to us when families move out. Right now, we are looking at allocating the 1,300 flats I mentioned. The speed at which we can allocate the flats really depends on the availability of those flats and the readiness of those flats. Sometimes, yes, as the Member mentioned, we see empty flats available, but it does not mean that they are not being allocated. They are being allocated, but sometimes, flats are affected by the Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP) quotas. But we try to allocate to those families who are on the queue as soon as we can.

Currently, only 11% or 18 of HDB neighbourhoods are affected by the EIP limits. For these neighbourhoods, flat sellers are usually still able to secure buyers from the eligible ethnic groups given the large volume of resale transactions annually.

I have had instances of residents coming to me saying that they are unable to sell their flats which have been on the market, in one case, for at least eight months, because they did not receive offers from persons of the relevant race. In cases like that, where they can demonstrate that they did not receive offers, will HDB exercise some flexibility?",1,4,012-001-090-022-011-004,115

We noticed that in many cases that are affected by EIP, at the end of the day, they are able to sell their flats. Majority of the cases that are affected by EIP are being sold either at or above valuation. The way we look at it is  we want to try to encourage these families to look at the conditions of their flats and to try their best to find buyers.",1,5,012-001-090-022-011-005,116
2013-09-16,Flexibility in Ethnic Integration Policy for HDB Flats,012-001-090-022-011,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"Yes, I understand that sometimes they are not able to receive any offers, but when we look deeper, often times, it is due to the kinds of prices that they are prepared to receive. The prices that they are prepared to offer are also dependent on the characteristics of the flats. If we looked at the figures, even in the Member's constituency in Bishan-Toa Payoh, the majority of flats that are affected by EIP have been able to be sold by sellers at or even above valuation. There are also flats that are not affected by EIP that were sold at below valuation. So, I think the EIP alone is not one of the key factors in determining whether the seller is able to sell their flats. We recognise that some face more challenges than others, but by and large, our data show that it is not impossible for them to be able to find the buyers of the necessary ethnic group.",2,6,012-001-090-022-011-006,117

It is beyond the Government at this point in time. We understand the importance of the EIP and because 90% of Singaporeans live in public housing estates, we want to ensure that the ethnic mix is useful for our society to continue to function. Within private housing estates and condominiums, these units are bound by the Management Councils' regulations. We will leave it at that. But we hope that Singaporeans will also be able to appreciate the mix that is required and that it would come naturally in the private estates.

Indeed, MOE kindergartens are a very good place to start and it is an excellent initiative. I have spoken with young parents and they welcome the added contributions to Child Development Accounts (CDAs). Unfortunately, some of the same young parents say that unscrupulous private operators in the forms of kindergartens and childcare centres use the increase in the CDA to raid and justify to themselves an increase in fees. So, sometimes, it is sort of like a dog catching its tail. More subsidies go into the CDA, and then the private childcare operators are sometimes unscrupulous to raise fees. That catches some parents off-guard.",1,6,012-001-090-022-012-006,125

If I could assist in this regard  MSF is the Ministry that looks after the pre-school sector as a whole. MOE's role is to look at curriculum and to provide input on that to make sure that the educational portions are addressed.

They must justify by giving the reasons for the increase and give six months' advance notice to give parents sufficient time to find an alternative if the parents are not able to afford that.

I would like to ask, therefore, that the MSF considers this very seriously on a whole-of-Government approach, that the MSF takes this very seriously because there has been quite a lot of feedback from young parents with pre-school-going children that whenever there is an added contribution from the Government into the CDA, somehow, magically, the fees increase downstream.

Assessable Income includes other forms of income from employment, such as allowances, bonuses and commissions, which can be significant sources of earnings in certain jobs. It also includes other income, such as rental income. It is fair and transparent that these sources of income are counted in. If instead we use basic annual salary, as Ms Lee Li Lian suggests, those who are well-off because they earn large commissions or bonuses will also benefit from the GST Voucher – Cash.",3,4,012-001-090-022-014-004,142

I have one supplementary question  whether the Ministry can consider, as I have mentioned earlier in my PQ, using basic salary instead of Assessable Income, with the provision that the Assessable Income is not more than a certain number of times of the basic salary, since allowances make up a substantial portion of low-income workers' pay. As such, they may inadvertently be left out of the scheme. For the Ministry's consideration, please.",1,6,012-001-090-022-014-006,144

The Suara Musyawarah Committee, chaired by Haji Sallim Abdul Kadir, has since completed its work and handed me its report on 7 July 2013.

In a short span of seven months, they worked tirelessly to dialogue with more than 500 members of the Malay/Muslim community from all walks of life, be they residents in rental housing, single mothers or professionals.

The Committee recommends media engagement to disseminate the message that the pursuit of excellence in all that we do is an Islamic virtue.

But clearly, in certain areas, we need to pay greater attention and I mentioned this during the recent Hari Raya speech. One area which the Committee recommended – and I think we should do this – is about how to reach out further to the vulnerable groups.

When the Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA) was amended in 2005 to create the CE post, I had explained in Parliament that this was to strengthen MUIS' executive leadership and align its governance practices to other statutory boards where there is a clear separation of board responsibilities and executive functions.

This separation of functions will enable experienced and qualified Muslim public officers to be appointed as the CE. The position of the non-executive President can then be filled by a person with stature and standing in the community, who does not have to run MUIS on a day-to-day basis at the same time. So, I am grateful that the previous President Haji Mohammad Alami Musa has agreed to remain as the non-executive President.

We will continue to identify capable persons to lead our key Muslim institutions. Indeed, there are challenges finding top-calibre officers to fill echelon positions, as is the case with all other organisations. One strategy that I am keen for MUIS to push further is the cross-posting of high potential Muslim officers between MUIS and the wider public service.

2013-09-16,Remuneration for Social Workers,012-001-090-022-017,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"Let me just explain a bit about this benchmarking exercise. Since one or two years back, we have started a regular benchmarking exercise. We asked ourselves, for the people who join the social service sector, what would their equivalent pay be if they hafd opted for a similar job in another industry or in the other Government agencies? For example, medical social workers, who are also part of our social workers community, would be used as one of the benchmarks. Then there are other Government civil servants whom we also can use as part of the benchmark. So, we do collect these data and we use an independent agency to set this benchmark for us to set realistic salary benchmarks for our social service professionals.",2,14,012-001-090-022-017-014,193

There is still a bit more to go but, in the next phase, we are actually going to look at the mid-career entrants and also the more senior social service professionals because we find that the gap between what they would command if they had chosen an equivalent job elsewhere, there is still a bigger gap than the entrants. So, we will continue to work on this and, indeed, we will communicate to everyone that it is not just the social workers that we are talking about when we talk about social service professionals, we are also talking about the therapists, counsellors and so forth.",3,15,012-001-090-022-017-015,194

I am sure we will see a great increase in the need for social workers with all the new initiatives that are going out, for example, the social service centres. I was also heartened to hear in the Minister's reply, when he mentioned about the Social Work Associates. In terms of reducing the pressure of recruiting new social workers, all of whom will require a degree, is the Ministry looking at expanding the role for these Social Work Associates so as to increase the talent pool of social workers but, at the same time, reduce the immediate pressure of recruiting social workers?",1,16,012-001-090-022-017-016,195

That is the second prong.",3,19,012-001-090-022-017-019,198
2013-09-16,Remuneration for Social Workers,012-001-090-022-017,Mr Chan Chun Sing,"The third prong of our approach has to do with the fact that we are going to up the training of the many social service assistants, staff that are now currently being deployed at the social service offices. Previously, they undergo some training but we are going to intensify the training so that they can do more of the social service work, at least as the first line to do the triage, before we refer the more complex cases to the social workers.",4,20,012-001-090-022-017-020,199

Today, typically, a social worker may spend up to 40% or 50% of their time doing administrative work, meaning that they have to write the case files and transfer some of the data. We are trying to simplify this by investing in a comprehensive social service IT Masterplan which will come online, hopefully, by 2016. This will allow the social service professionals to share data at the same time to make the case management that much easier, very much akin to what we have for the healthcare system.",6,22,012-001-090-022-017-022,201

But having said that, it is not one specific target for the entire social service sector because there are different tiers of social service sector professionals and their pay gap has differences in the magnitude. So, for different sectors, for different tiers, we will set different targets.

Minister, I applaud and support all the steps that we are taking in this sector. I would like to ask whether the Ministry has a sense of the current shortfall of workers and professionals in this sector. I ask this because I expect that, in fact, the demand for these professionals and then other workers in this area will only grow and intensify. I hope that beyond making it more attractive for our citizens to work in this sector, if need to, we should allow the FSCs and the VWOs to also look at alternative sources outside the sector.",1,25,012-001-090-022-017-025,204

Yes, indeed, we do make a projection on the needs, especially with our ageing population, the number of social workers and social work associates that we will need. So, we do have a projection. And I would say that it is particularly challenging not just for the baseline social workers but actually for what we call the specialists, those that specialise in, for example, family violence, spousal abuse. So, we need social workers not just to have the requisite numbers. We also need a certain critical mass of social workers with the requisite depth and skills to handle the more complex cases going forward.",1,26,012-001-090-022-017-026,205

Some of our Family Service Centres (FSCs), indeed, do recruit from overseas. But we understand that it is not so easy to recruit a person from overseas to work in the social service sector in our own domestic social service sector because, culturally, there are differences. Language-wise, there are also differences. Even to recruit youngsters to work in the social service sector, sometimes, our youngsters also do not have the necessary dialect skills to communicate with our elders.

When the new National Stadium is ready and we have the National Day Parade potentially moving to the new National Stadium, we can consider long-term potential uses for the floating platform. So, that is being studied, not just by Singapore Sports Council itself, but also in partnership with potentially other agencies which may have an interest in the long-term uses of the floating platform.",1,8,012-001-090-022-018-008,215

This is out of the 550 buses that the Government had committed to. On top of these 550 buses, the operators themselves will add in another 250. But here, I am talking about the 550 buses and we have, over the past one year, added about 250 of these buses. By the end of this year, more than half of the 550 buses committed by the Government will be on our roads.

The data is from 2008. The increase has been quite significant. Spending on tuition has also grown from about $410 million in 1998 to $820 million in 2008.",1,9,012-001-090-022-021-009,241

2013-09-16,Impact of Growing Private Tuition Industry,012-001-090-022-021,Ms Janice Koh,"  Is there a need, or is there some concern, to study this relationship between household income and expenditure on tuition and its impact on social mobility, given that we are facing rising income inequality and rising costs in Singapore? And what would be the impact of this study on our educational policy and our approach to making educational opportunities equal for all?",1,12,012-001-090-022-021-012,244
2013-09-16,Impact of Growing Private Tuition Industry,012-001-090-022-021,Ms Indranee Rajah,"  Mdm Speaker, there are actually two separate concepts embodied in the supplementary question asked by the Member. One is social mobility and the other is why parents go for tuition. If I may address the second question first. It would be a social mobility problem if the only way you could pass an examination in our education system is if you had tuition. Then it would be a social mobility problem because questions of ""Can you afford tuition?"" would come into play, and if you cannot, it means you are not able to make it. But that is not the case.",1,13,012-001-090-022-021-013,245
2013-09-16,Impact of Growing Private Tuition Industry,012-001-090-022-021,Ms Indranee Rajah,"As I have indicated in my earlier answer, the education system is designed to be passed even without tuition generally. Having said that, we recognise that there are those who will not do as well as the others and who need support. For that, if we did nothing and we just left the children alone, that would be wrong. Because we recognise that for those who need additional support, we must help them. And because additionally, this Government and my Ministry recognise that those from lower income backgrounds will have more difficulties in being able to get tuition and pay for that, that is the reason why a comprehensive levelling-up programme has been introduced in the schools and that is across-the-board. That would be particularly useful for those who are unable to afford private tuition but, certainly, it is not limited to that group because the levelling-up programme is basically for anyone or any child who is not doing well in a particular subject.",2,14,012-001-090-022-021-014,246
2013-09-16,Impact of Growing Private Tuition Industry,012-001-090-022-021,Ms Indranee Rajah,"That leads us to the other question which is why do so many parents still nevertheless send their children for tuition, including that group where the children are actually doing reasonably well in school. And there, really we have a situation where it is a question of what the parents think or what the parents believe. MOE's position is that actually such additional tuition for those who are doing reasonably well in school ought not to be necessary. We certainly do hope that the parents would have a more calibrated and balanced view of tuition and only send their children if there was a real need for it. Because if not, doing it within the context of the school and doing the levelling-up programmes within the context of the school would be a much better approach.",3,15,012-001-090-022-021-015,247

I believe that there is some data to show that the tuition industry is – and these are a few years' old data – at least $800 million. I think, by now, it could be a $1-billion industry.

2013-09-16,Impact of Growing Private Tuition Industry,012-001-090-022-021,Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio),  A question for the Senior Minister of State. I agree with the point raised by the hon Member Ms Denise Phua that there are quite a number of private tutors who used to be teachers with MOE in the past. I am quite concerned about this. I wonder whether MOE will consider reviewing the provision given to teachers that they can give private tuition – existing current teachers who can give private tuition for up to about six hours per week; whether that can be reviewed where teachers can no longer do so. That could probably be a start to trying to curb this attraction towards the private tuition industry.,1,23,012-001-090-022-021-023,255
2013-09-16,Impact of Growing Private Tuition Industry,012-001-090-022-021,Ms Indranee Rajah,"  Mdm Speaker, insofar as the question is about good teachers leaving the Education Service to go into the private sector, as I indicated in the earlier answer, in general, the attrition rate is low. It is not to say that there will not be some who leave for whatever reasons and go into the private sector. Certainly, we would want to retain as many as we can in the Education Service.",1,24,012-001-090-022-021-024,256
2013-09-16,Impact of Growing Private Tuition Industry,012-001-090-022-021,Ms Indranee Rajah,"Just as a quick rundown. The types of reasons that have been given for teachers leaving the Education Service are a whole range. Some have given domestic or personal reasons, some list external competition, they want to do other things, some for health reasons, some because they are not happy with the job but that is actually a very low percentage and then others which did not divulge their reasons.",2,25,012-001-090-022-021-025,257
2013-09-16,Impact of Growing Private Tuition Industry,012-001-090-022-021,Ms Indranee Rajah,"That said, I think the key point made by Ms Denise Phua and Dr Intan is, if there are good teachers who would otherwise stay and if they can be kept within the Education Service, then that I feel we should certainly do so and our Ministry would look to the question of what these teachers feel would be a good reason for them to stay with the Education Service and if there are those who have left because of whatever reasons – they feel that they would get a better job or better opportunities in private sector – then we have to see whether those are people who can be persuaded to stay or for whatever reason they feel that no matter what, they would go out into the private sector. We can certainly look into that.",3,26,012-001-090-022-021-026,258

2013-09-16, Impact of Potential Rising Interest Rates on Singapore Economy,012-001-090-022-024,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),"In this situation, financial markets are likely to adjust to the QE tapering in an orderly manner. The impact on our exports to the US will therefore be small, as US economic growth is not expected to be significantly affected by the tapering. Accordingly, the overall impact of the QE tapering on the Singapore economy is likely to be limited.",2,3,012-001-090-022-024-003,292
2013-09-16, Impact of Potential Rising Interest Rates on Singapore Economy,012-001-090-022-024,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),"Nevertheless, the Government is mindful of the risks of a more disorderly process of QE tapering. In particular, if the QE tapering is done prematurely or if financial markets overreact to the QE tapering leading to a sharp spike in interest rates, the US economy could stall. In this scenario, our exports to the US will be adversely affected. There will also be a sharp pullback in financial markets, which will affect the sentiment-sensitive cluster of our finance sector, including stock broking and fund management activities. These will, in turn, significantly affect our economic growth. However, our assessment is that the risk of such a scenario is low.",3,4,012-001-090-022-024-004,293
2013-09-16, Impact of Potential Rising Interest Rates on Singapore Economy,012-001-090-022-024,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),"Barring the materialisation of downside risks, the main challenge that the eventual QE tapering will pose for businesses in Singapore is the normalisation of the interest rate environment. Due to unprecedented loose global monetary conditions, our domestic interest rates have remained unusually low for the past few years. However, when global monetary conditions start to return to normalcy with the QE tapering and the subsequent rise in US interest rates, domestic interest rates will also rise in tandem. This will, in turn, translate into higher borrowing costs for businesses, especially our SMEs.",4,5,012-001-090-022-024-005,294
2013-09-16, Impact of Potential Rising Interest Rates on Singapore Economy,012-001-090-022-024,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),"Businesses should be prepared for the eventual rise in our interest rates, as it will not be prudent for the Government to lower borrowing costs for businesses artificially. Instead, the Government will continue to support our SMEs by helping them to raise their capabilities and productivity so that they can grow their revenue and cope with higher borrowing costs. In addition, to ensure that credit remains accessible to our SMEs, SPRING has schemes, such as the Micro Loan Programme, the Local Enterprise Finance Scheme and the Loan Insurance Scheme.",5,6,012-001-090-022-024-006,295

In March 2012, Singapore launched a National Plan of Action that maps our strategies and plans to combat TIP.",2,6,012-001-090-022-025-006,304
2013-09-16,Tackling Cross-border Human Trafficking,012-001-090-022-025,Mr S Iswaran,The TIP Taskforce works closely with overseas law enforcement agencies and embassies of countries that victims may originate from. This close cooperation ensures that reports of trafficking are quickly and thoroughly investigated. Information sharing and upstream enforcement against human traffickers also prevent other innocent victims from being exploited.,3,7,012-001-090-022-025-007,305
2013-09-16,Tackling Cross-border Human Trafficking,012-001-090-022-025,Mr S Iswaran,"Singapore participates in various regional and international efforts to combat TIP, including the ASEAN Senior Officials Meeting on Transnational Crime (SOMTC) and its Working Group on Trafficking in Persons. At the operational level, Police attend meetings of the ASEAN Heads of Specialist Units (HSUs) on Trafficking. These are useful platforms for enhancing cooperation and sharing of information among the ASEAN countries. Beyond ASEAN, we also work with partners, such as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Group of Friends (GoF) United Against Human Trafficking in New York and Geneva, to find better ways to combat TIP.",4,8,012-001-090-022-025-008,306
2013-09-16,Tackling Cross-border Human Trafficking,012-001-090-022-025,Mr S Iswaran,"The Member has also asked about INTERPOL. Police have been working with INTERPOL to share information on trafficking, as well as offer assistance to investigate into potential TIP cases. Comprising 190 member countries, INTERPOL facilitates international police cooperation even where diplomatic relations do not exist between particular countries. It offers law enforcement agencies opportunities to network and to enhance their capabilities through sharing of information, conducting training workshops, and collaborating on tactical operations. With the establishment of the INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation (IGCI) in Singapore, we will have a cutting-edge research and development facility for the identification of crimes and criminals, innovative training, operational support and partnerships, to combat transnational and syndicated crimes, such as human trafficking.",5,9,012-001-090-022-025-009,307

I have seen some of the views of NGOs. In fact, I spoke with one NGO, made up of Catholic nuns, and they gave me a paper which they did research on, and they came up with some proposals on how to help the accused trafficker. Therefore, would the Ministry be open to more cooperation with impartial NGOs to reach out to the vulnerable ones – vulnerable women and children – because I think it would be easier for them, especially if they are trafficked on vulnerable positions, to speak with a disarming NGO rather than a Government officer who perhaps wants to interview them rather than just receive sharing from these vulnerable people?",1,12,012-001-090-022-025-012,310
2013-09-16,Tackling Cross-border Human Trafficking,012-001-090-022-025,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The second supplementary question is on legal tools for extra-jurisdictional reach. Many of these are cross-border crimes. Would we be open to creating an Act or a Bill with extra-jurisdictional reach, where the aiding and the abetting of the crime happen overseas?",2,13,012-001-090-022-025-013,311
2013-09-16,Tackling Cross-border Human Trafficking,012-001-090-022-025,Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah),"The third supplementary question is this. The Misuse of Drugs Act is feared in Singapore. And I think we need, in my humble view, something similar in the form of legislature to deter and attack the scourge of human trafficking within ASEAN, especially if it comes through our corridors. Therefore, would there be open consideration for a similar Act, say, an Organised Crime Act, which would go upstream and tackle the people who are actually behind this horrible trade?",3,14,012-001-090-022-025-014,312
2013-09-16,Tackling Cross-border Human Trafficking,012-001-090-022-025,Mr S Iswaran,"  Madam, I thank the Member for his detailed suggestions. First, on cooperation with NGOs – I think the Member used the term ""impartial NGOs"". First, in general, there were four prongs in the way we are dealing with this issue, and I want to reiterate them because I think it is noteworthy. It is prevention of the crime; prosecution of the offenders; protection of the victims and partnerships with other countries, embassies and NGOs, the private sector. The Member's suggestion on cooperation with NGOs is, therefore, welcomed. We are open to the idea. We work closely with MSF. Depending on the nature of the proposal and the ideas that are put on the table, I think we can take that discussion forward.",1,15,012-001-090-022-025-015,313
2013-09-16,Tackling Cross-border Human Trafficking,012-001-090-022-025,Mr S Iswaran,"Second, I think the two points are inter-related. The Member's question was whether we would contemplate, given the nature of this crime and given it is transnational, transboundary and organised in nature, and consider an Act, like an Organised Crime Act, and whether we would contemplate extra-jurisdictional reach in that regard. We are studying the merits of the possibility of such an Act for organised crime and we will take into account some of the points the Member has made.",2,16,012-001-090-022-025-016,314

The PDPA is a baseline law that ensures a common standard of protection for individuals' personal data across the economy, especially in sectors where rules on the management of personal data are currently lacking. For sectors that are already regulated by other laws and regulations, such as the healthcare sector, the PDPA will apply concurrently. Organisations in those sectors will continue to comply with the requirements under their current laws and regulations as well as the PDPA.

For third-party providers that are not covered under the healthcare Act and MOH, that are collecting information, either IT-providers or phone service providers, there is uncertainty because some of the information is collected in the context of healthcare but is not technical or medical information. Would that information be covered under the Personal Data Protection Act or the existing regulations?",1,4,012-001-090-022-026-004,318
2013-09-16,Impact of Personal Data Protection Act on Healthcare Information ,012-001-090-022-026,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"  For third-party providers, in certain cases, depending on what exactly the use of the data is collected for, we have to look at the usage. By and large, it should be covered because you are basically working on instruction of another party to collect the data for certain purposes. Therefore, the individual who is actually giving up the information must be assured that data is collected for that particular purpose. As far as we are concerned, the baseline of the PDPA will prevail across but, if there are exceptions to be made, we have to look at the exceptions because there are exceptions within this threshold.",1,5,012-001-090-022-026-005,319

MDA, therefore, provides some leeway to these institutions to screen films for educational purposes, on condition that these films have either been previously classified by the MDA, or prior approval has been sought from the MDA before the films are acquired.

Evidence has shown that development of early cognitive ability is strongly associated with educational success, higher income and better health later in life. The early years are also important for the development of non-cognitive skills, such as application, self-regulation, resilience and empathy. These are the emotional and social capabilities that enable children to make and sustain positive relationships and succeed both in school and in later life.

Intervening earlier with troubled families not only prevents children and their parents from falling into cycles of deprivation, anti-social behaviour and poverty but also saves thousands, if not, millions in the longer term.

Our belief is that we must provide more for those with less. We do not want to apply universal subsidy because we have found this to be wasteful and not targeted. I will give some examples of how we target our help to those with the least. These include Public Assistance, but specifically, for children and for children with special needs, we have a tiered subsidy framework to help the children from disadvantaged backgrounds more. For example, in our childcare subsidy, we have targeted our help to the bottom two-thirds of our entire population base while everyone in the population enjoy a baseline subsidy. At the lowest end of the curve, a family earning about $1,000 or so, can send their child to a childcare centre at $3 per month, and, very often, many VWO hosts would even raise this amount of money to help out the families with the least.",2,35,012-001-090-022-032-035,366

There are five aspects of our integration that we would like to talk about in the design of our social service system to help those with the least. The first is the integration of programming. We want to provide holistic and multi-dimensional help, as alluded to by Dr Lily Neo. We know that many of these needs are, indeed, multi-dimensional – they do not just require financial help – very often they require help in healthcare, housing, employment, social-emotional support and family support.",4,37,012-001-090-022-032-037,368

And we agree fully with Dr Lily Neo that the role of the community is as important in the support of these families in need. This is the reason why MSF has started the Family Matters! initiative which encompasses Family Matters at work, in school, community and business. We want Family Life Education to permeate every aspect of society. We also want our VWOs to reach out upstream to the families most in need. For example, I am very happy to see that agencies like the CDAC have started programmes to help families in need and they cater time for these families in need to attend those programmes because many of them are working and the time slots when they can attend such programmes may not be the conventional ones that we are used to.",6,39,012-001-090-022-032-039,370

We are very keenly aware that we are not dealing with statistics, we are dealing with people's lives and we must always act in the best interests of the child, be it in the case of marital conflict, divorce proceedings or fights over a child's custody. But we cannot do this alone. We cannot rely on policies and institutions alone.

Singapore then was not even yet independent and still a colony. On length of service alone, 58 years is a remarkable record. But it is what Mr Lee has accomplished for Singapore over that lifetime of service and struggle that is astonishing and without peer. I would not recount these accomplishments today.

2013-09-16,Safety and Security in Areas Close to Foreign Worker Dormitories,012-001-090-022-038,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"  Foreign workers complement our local workforce and contribute to our economy. The vast majority of foreign workers is law-abiding and come to Singapore to earn an honest living and support their families back home. The Government understands Singaporeans' concerns over potential disamenities and possible impact on safety and security where there are large congregations of foreign workers, especially near residential estates. There is an inter-agency effort underway to address this issue, with the implementation of various measures to address these concerns. They include providing for workers recreational needs, stepping up the presence of uniformed officers, involving foreign workers themselves in crime prevention, and educating foreign workers on Singapore’s laws and social norms.",1,2,012-001-090-022-038-002,421

These officers conduct foot patrols in foreign worker congregation areas to assuage residents' security concerns, help detect and deter crime, enforce against anti-social behaviour, such as spitting and littering, and improve the safety and security of residents living in housing estates close to foreign worker dormitories. Since October 2012, CCTVs were also deployed at 20 foreign worker congregation hotspots to complement the patrols, as a pilot to test the effectiveness of CCTVs in managing congregations.",3,4,012-001-090-022-038-004,423

Reliable foreign workers are identified and trained on crime prevention, so that they can share this knowledge with fellow workers. This programme has been implemented in various foreign worker dormitories and was also recently implemented in Nee Soon, where the ambassadors assist to mediate disputes which arise amongst workers, to maintain peace and order in the dormitories. Some foreign workers also volunteer with the Citizens-on-Patrol (COP) groups to spread crime-prevention messages within the foreign worker community. For example, the Toh Guan Patriots is a group of 30 foreign worker volunteers who assist in relaying crime prevention messages and advice against anti-social behaviour to other foreign workers in their neighbourhood.",4,5,012-001-090-022-038-005,424

In this recent episode, the actual number of days when the PSI level was unhealthy was limited as Singapore alerted the Indonesians to the problem as soon as we experienced hazy conditions. The actions of the Indonesians and favourable winds reduced the potential economic impact of the haze. As a result, absenteeism rates did not rise significantly during the week of the haze, and businesses did not experience a sharp drop in activity.

A local study based on Singapore's suicide statistics from 2000-2004 had reported that relationship problems were associated with one-third of all suicides, and financial or employment issues were associated with a further one-third. For suicides amongst the elderly, gradual physical disability and suffering were important risk factors, especially if coupled with a lack of adequate community and family support.

In cases where the parents are divorced, the parent who is granted custody of the child may apply as a single parent for the subsidy. The Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) will assess the application based on that parent’s working status and income, and adjust the subsidy where necessary. For example, if the father is given custody of the child and applies for the subsidy, the father will be the main applicant and will be eligible for all subsidies based solely on his working status and income.",2,3,012-001-090-022-066-003,548

2013-09-16,Measures against Credit Card Debts,012-001-090-022-075,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"But low default rates should not lull us into complacency. We should reduce the risk of people borrowing beyond their means. To ensure that those who use credit cards have sufficient financial means to service their debts, MAS has imposed minimum income eligibility criteria for the issue of credit cards. Individuals who are 55 years old and below must have an annual income of at least $30,000 before they can qualify for credit cards; those above 55 years of age must have an annual income of at least $15,000. In addition, MAS has a limit of up to four months' income on the total amount of unsecured credit that can be extended to any credit cardholder. Credit card issuers are also required to conduct comprehensive credit bureau checks on an individual's credit history before issuing new credit cards.",3,4,012-001-090-022-075-004,591
2013-09-16,Measures against Credit Card Debts,012-001-090-022-075,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"To further promote the prudent use of unsecured credit, MAS announced on 11 September new measures targeted at those who are at greatest risk of debt problems. A key change is the introduction of an industry-wide aggregate cap on individuals' unsecured borrowings. With this cap, financial institutions will not be allowed to grant further credit to individuals whose aggregate unsecured borrowings across all financial institutions exceed 12 months of their income for 90 days or more. This cap is designed to discourage individuals from prolonged reliance on credit cards and unsecured credit. MAS has set the limit at 12 months' income, for a start, and will adjust the limit, if necessary, to further encourage financial prudence. Aside from this, financial institutions will not be allowed to grant further credit to individuals whose debts with a financial institution are more than 60 days past due. These recent policy changes complement MAS' existing credit card rules in preventing debt from spiralling out of hand for individuals across all age groups.",4,5,012-001-090-022-075-005,592

They have to exercise prudence when deciding whether to sign up for a credit card, understand their ability to repay the debt incurred when they use the card and ensure that they do not incur excessive debt. The MoneySENSE national financial education programme has collaborated with the media, the industry and consumer organisations to educate consumers on factors to consider before taking on debt and the consequences of late payments.

Nevertheless, the Government notes public feedback and recognises that more can be done to improve the visitor experience. A multiagency effort will embark on the following first, make Gillman Barracks more accessible and convenient for visitors, through covered walkways to transport nodes and between galleries, as well as more food, beverage and retail spaces in the vicinity; second, work with partners to anchor events and activities that add vibrancy and complement the galleries; and lastly, increase public outreach through publicising events on social and traditional media. To complement the Government's efforts, the galleries have also formed a Gillman Barrack Galleries Association to collectively drive initiatives. For example, to increase the outreach to tourists, the association has recently hosted hotel concierges to share more with them on Gillman Barracks as the destination for contemporary art in Singapore.",4,5,012-001-090-022-079-005,612

2013-09-16,Introduction of Knowledge and Inquiry (KI) as a Subject in Junior Colleges (JCs),012-001-090-022-102,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Since the introduction of KI, enrolment has declined from about 360 students in 12 JCs to 141 students in seven JCs. The key challenge is the lack of trained teachers. Unlike other subjects drawn usually from a single discipline, KI cuts across a number of disciplines. This poses a demand on teachers who would typically have read particular disciplines during tertiary education. In addition, KI teachers are drawn from the same pool of teachers teaching well-established subjects with larger candidatures like the General Paper and Humanities subjects. MOE recognises the challenge and has taken steps to address the shortage of teachers by providing training and professional development.",3,4,012-001-090-022-102-004,715

2013-09-16,CPF Housing Withdrawal Limit,012-001-090-022-106,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"  First, let me clarify the limits that are set on use of CPF savings for housing.

2013-09-16,CPF Housing Withdrawal Limit,012-001-090-022-106,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Whether a member is able to fully finance his housing loan with his CPF savings depends on several factors, including the property price and corresponding loan amount required as well as the loan tenure and interest charge. Most CPF members have been prudent and have taken the CPF usage limits for housing into account before deciding which property to purchase. In this way, they have avoided overstretching themselves and hence leave sufficient CPF savings for their retirement needs.",2,3,012-001-090-022-106-003,729
2013-09-16,CPF Housing Withdrawal Limit,012-001-090-022-106,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Today, the number of CPF members who have reached their VL and are unable to set aside half the Minimum Sum is small – at less than half a per cent of those who are using CPF to service their housing loans. For affected members, where the case merits, we have exercised flexibility and allowed them to use CPF savings beyond the VL. The number of members who have reached the WL is even smaller. The VL and WL also do not apply to members who purchase a new flat directly from HDB and finance the property via a HDB loan.",3,4,012-001-090-022-106-004,730

2013-09-16,Maternity-related Disputes and Complaints,012-001-090-022-107,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The very large majority of disputes referred to the Ministry are not straightforward cases of unfair treatment. In these cases, dismissal was also related to alleged employees' poor performance or misconduct. Notwithstanding this, our laws ensure that female employees are protected against unfair dismissal during their pregnancy or when they are on maternity leave. From 1 May 2013, the maternity protection period has been enhanced to cover the full period of pregnancy.
