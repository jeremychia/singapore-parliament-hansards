2022-03-03,Review of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for Children Aged Five and Under,014-001-095-053-001,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Senior Minister of State for his reply. What is the infection rate of children under five years old in Singapore? There is a new study that suggests that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is less effective for children. Is the Ministry looking into other vaccines like the one by Johnson & Johnson or non-mRNA vaccines like the ones by Sinovac or Novavax, for approval for use in children below five? What more should parents of children below five years old do to prevent them from getting COVID-19, since there is currently no vaccination?",1,5,014-001-095-053-001-005,5
2022-03-03,Review of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for Children Aged Five and Under,014-001-095-053-001,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"  Sir, the Member asked three questions. For the first, the specific data is a slightly different issue from the Parliamentary Question (PQ) he had filed. I suggest he file a PQ, potentially a written PQ, for that data. We will get it to him.",1,6,014-001-095-053-001-006,6
2022-03-03,Review of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for Children Aged Five and Under,014-001-095-053-001,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"For his second question about other vaccines, we are studying all clinical data that is being produced for all the therapeutic interventions for COVID-19. We will take that data, we will take the recommendations from our professionals and experts, and we will assess the various products as they become available for licensing here in Singapore.",2,7,014-001-095-053-001-007,7
2022-03-03,Review of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for Children Aged Five and Under,014-001-095-053-001,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"In terms of what parents can do, hygiene continues to be important. Making sure that we stay at home if we are feeling unwell, engage with the testing procedures, the various protocols that we have explained for community protocols – Protocols 1, 2 and 3. These are not just for ourselves. They are for our family, our loved ones and society at large. And if we can all play our part in helping, then, the youngest, most vulnerable and all vulnerable members of our society will be better protected.",3,8,014-001-095-053-001-008,8

2022-03-03,Review of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for Children Aged Five and Under,014-001-095-053-001,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"  Thank you, Mr Speaker. Just a quick question for the Senior Minister of State. This is with regard to the study that was being referred to by hon Member Mr Yip Hon Weng. Has that changed the consideration of the Expert Committee and the Ministry as to the effectiveness of vaccination amongst children, especially those from five to 12? How is the Ministry responding to that study? Is the Ministry undertaking its own independent study in Singapore as to the effectiveness of the vaccine for children above the age of 12?",1,10,014-001-095-053-001-010,10
2022-03-03,Review of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for Children Aged Five and Under,014-001-095-053-001,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"  Sir, I thank the Member for the questions. The issue is not whether a vaccine is or is not effective. There is a matter of timing of those and the circumstances. So, the matter continues to be studied by various people around the world, as well as our experts here.",1,11,014-001-095-053-001-011,11

2022-03-03,Reviews on Necessity of TraceTogether and SafeEntry Scans,014-001-095-053-002,Mr Leon Perera,"asked the Minister for Health (a) how regularly does the Ministry conduct reviews on the necessity of TraceTogether and SafeEntry; (b) what are the metrics that the Ministry considers when making this regular determination that TraceTogether and SafeEntry are still necessary; and (c) whether the Ministry (i) quantifies the impact of the compliance burden on business owners, the effect on productivity and electricity consumption in general in enforcing these requirements and (ii) takes into account this burden in the metrics.",1,1,014-001-095-053-002-001,13
2022-03-03,Reviews on Necessity of TraceTogether and SafeEntry Scans,014-001-095-053-002,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Health),"  Sir, as we have described in previous responses to Parliamentary Questions, TraceTogether and SafeEntry continue to play important roles in our pandemic response system. TraceTogether and SafeEntry enable verification checks into venues or activities where vaccination-differentiated safe management measures (VDS) are in force. This is necessary to protect unvaccinated persons who remain at higher risk of severe disease.",1,2,014-001-095-053-002-002,14
2022-03-03,Reviews on Necessity of TraceTogether and SafeEntry Scans,014-001-095-053-002,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Health),"We aim to keep rules and requirements simple, and we regularly review the need for these. We will continue to rationalise and simplify our safe management measures.",2,3,014-001-095-053-002-003,15

2022-03-03,Reviews on Necessity of TraceTogether and SafeEntry Scans,014-001-095-053-002,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"  I thank the Senior Minister of State for his answer. Just one supplementary question. Given that the compliance burden for TraceTogether and SafeEntry is not insignificant – it impacts time, productivity and so on – what would be the criterion or criteria that the Ministry would use to make the decision to phase it out? At what point will that actually happen?",1,5,014-001-095-053-002-005,17
2022-03-03,Reviews on Necessity of TraceTogether and SafeEntry Scans,014-001-095-053-002,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"  I thank the Member for his questions. Indeed, measures that affect public health and safety do have a compliance burden. This is not unique to TraceTogether and SafeEntry. Neither is it unique to the COVID-19 situation. If we look at, for example, the automobile industry, the use of seat belts is a cost burden, but we do it now after many decades of education because it has proven its worth.",1,6,014-001-095-053-002-006,18
2022-03-03,Reviews on Necessity of TraceTogether and SafeEntry Scans,014-001-095-053-002,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"So, really, the issue is whether or not the approach that we are taking has proven its worth. I hope the Member will agree that it has the ability to issue Health Risk Warnings and Notices very quickly in the face of a rapidly progressing pandemic; is an important public health measure. These have managed to keep our case fatality rate low as we have slowed the spread and allowed people to self-isolate and seek help very early on in the illness. As long as we are able to do that and to demonstrate an effectiveness of using TraceTogether, SafeEntry and VDS in our public health response, then I hope the Member will agree that the ability to save lives, prevent morbidity and mortality through this disease is a beneficial outcome and is worth paying that compliance cost and compliance burden for.",2,7,014-001-095-053-002-007,19
2022-03-03,Reviews on Necessity of TraceTogether and SafeEntry Scans,014-001-095-053-002,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"Studies in other parts of the world, there was a UK study that was published looking at this, looking at some modelling and the extent to which this automated contact tracing approach saves lives, prevents cases, and we have every reason to believe the same is true here in Singapore.",3,8,014-001-095-053-002-008,20
2022-03-03,Reviews on Necessity of TraceTogether and SafeEntry Scans,014-001-095-053-002,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"The study that was done in the UK. If we extrapolate that approach to our situation here, the estimate is that between September 2021 and January 2022, comparing similar data-sets over about those four, five months, the contact tracing approach that we have taken in Singapore may have saved about 290 deaths and slowed down the progression to avoid about 144,000 cases. I hope the Member would agree that these are useful outcomes.",4,9,014-001-095-053-002-009,21
2022-03-03,Reviews on Necessity of TraceTogether and SafeEntry Scans,014-001-095-053-002,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"When will we no longer need such an approach, when will we phase out and what may the criteria be, it is a bit too early to tell. We need to wait until we no longer need VDS, we need to wait until we are quite sure that the pandemic and COVID-19 is no longer epidemic but is endemic. We have not reached that point yet. It is very hard to say with some degree of certainty what that date will be. But I think we have explained before that as long as we need the measures in place – the public health measures, the VDS – then, today, the easiest way and the least burdensome way and the cheapest way for businesses, for us to roll out these measures, is to continue with the TraceTogether and SafeEntry systems that we have in place, rather than standing up a whole new system and a whole new infrastructure in order to get those outcomes. So, when we no longer need those measures, then we would stand down the systems.",5,10,014-001-095-053-002-010,22
2022-03-03,Voting Arrangements to Improve Voting Accessibility in Future Elections,014-001-095-053-003,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Prime Minister given that special arrangements were made during the 2020 General Election for those on Stay-Home Notice at designated facilities to vote at these facilities away from other voters (a) whether the Government has any plans to provide similar arrangements for other groups of voters at future elections; and (b) whether the Government will also consider mail-in voting for Singaporeans who are overseas.,1,1,014-001-095-053-003-001,23

2022-03-03,Voting Arrangements to Improve Voting Accessibility in Future Elections,014-001-095-053-003,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing) (for the Prime Minister),"The 2020 General Election, or GE2020, which was held amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighted two key issues in the electoral landscape. First, the electorate is ageing rapidly  21% of Singapore Citizens in the Registers of Electors were aged 65 and above in GE2020, from 14% in GE2011. Second, from time to time, travel difficulties, such as in this pandemic, would make it difficult for Singaporeans working, studying or living overseas, to vote. In spite of the challenges of the pandemic, 6,500 overseas citizens registered to vote in GE2020, from just 3,500 in GE2011. We recognise that many overseas Singaporeans remain engaged with Singapore and are keen to exercise their vote.",2,3,014-001-095-053-003-003,25
2022-03-03,Voting Arrangements to Improve Voting Accessibility in Future Elections,014-001-095-053-003,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing) (for the Prime Minister),"As the Member noted, the Elections Department, or ELD, made a special arrangement at GE2020 to allow voters serving Stay-Home Notice at designated hotels to cast their votes. ELD is looking at piloting this arrangement for voters residing at some nursing homes. With this in place, there will no longer be a need for nursing homes to bring their elderly voters staying with them to the polling stations to vote.",3,4,014-001-095-053-003-004,26
2022-03-03,Voting Arrangements to Improve Voting Accessibility in Future Elections,014-001-095-053-003,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing) (for the Prime Minister),"For overseas Singaporeans, ELD had established overseas polling stations for them to cast their vote. This is because voting by paper ballot at polling stations remains the most transparent and secure method of voting that best ensures the integrity of the voting process and secrecy of votes. However, ELD recognises that it may not be possible for various reasons, for some overseas Singaporeans to travel to these overseas polling stations to vote. ELD is thus studying if we can introduce postal voting and allow overseas Singaporeans to mail in their votes.",4,5,014-001-095-053-003-005,27
2022-03-03,Voting Arrangements to Improve Voting Accessibility in Future Elections,014-001-095-053-003,The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing) (for the Prime Minister),"Mr Speaker, Sir, any new voting arrangements will need to provide balance between greater voting accessibility and convenience for voters with ensuring the integrity of the voting process and secrecy of the vote. ELD expects to engage the public and key stakeholders, such as the political parties, nursing homes and overseas Singaporeans, on the possibility of piloting these initiatives sometime in the middle of this year.",5,6,014-001-095-053-003-006,28

2022-03-03,Seniors Reached via SG Cyber Safe Seniors Programme,014-001-095-053-004,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"  Mr Speaker, we are very mindful about how digitalisation impacts our vulnerable groups. In 2021, we launched the SG Cyber Safe Seniors Programme to raise awareness of cyber threats and encourage adoption of good cyber hygiene among seniors. More than 14,000 seniors have attended this programme between July and December 2021. We target to reach out to 50,000 seniors by 2023.",1,2,014-001-095-053-004-002,30
2022-03-03,Seniors Reached via SG Cyber Safe Seniors Programme,014-001-095-053-004,The Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo),"The programme reaches out to as many seniors as possible by working through various channels, such as pop-up events, webinars, as well as the SG Digital Community Hubs across Singapore. These hubs are conveniently located at community centres and public libraries, and seniors can walk-in to any of these hubs for one-on-one sessions with a Digital Ambassador. In addition to CSA’s SG Cyber Safe Seniors Programme, my Ministry also engages seniors on digital skills through other platforms, such as e-getai and dialect drama series, and IMDA’s SG Digital Office and NLB’s SURE programmes. For example, IMDA's SG Digital Office has reached out to more than 130,000 seniors and the curriculum and the types of interactions can certainly include cyber hygiene practices.",2,3,014-001-095-053-004-003,31

That is a method that we will continue to deploy.

But, with respect to both cybersecurity and coding, which we have also discussed in previous Parliamentary Questions (PQs), it is really important that our children are given that digital mindset early in life; otherwise, it could be another source of future inequality and lack of social mobility.

In the thick of the pandemic, military units continued to honour their departing Servicemen in milestone parades, making sure to arrange for remote viewing avenues such that Singaporean families could share in the pride and joy. Further, MINDEF and the Armed Forces’ have signalled their holistic commitment to the defence of Singapore in our greatest times of testing, mobilising our Servicemen to aid in contact tracing measures which are pivotal as we deal with COVID-19 as a nation.",1,69,014-001-095-053-010-069,167

As all Members of the House know, our birth rates are low and what this then translates into would be smaller NS cohorts 18 years hence.

Functional assessment allows us to assess the NSFs’ abilities to perform physical tasks required for the job in order to better match them to vocations with greater precision and to enable them to discharge their duties well and safely. These assessments have been developed in consultation with external physiotherapy specialists, alongside SAF physiotherapists from our Centre of Excellence for Soldier Performance.",6,82,014-001-095-053-010-082,180

For instance, take the example of the redesign of the medic role. Leveraging advances in medical technology and efforts to define the physical demands required for each specific role, Servicemen of varying physical capabilities can now be deployed as medics. This approach has enabled the SAF to maximise our Servicemen’s potential to contribute to the SAF’s operational requirements.",9,85,014-001-095-053-010-085,183

But there is also another important angle which is equally important and this concerns the skills, knowledge and expertise of our Servicemen. Our population may be small, but it is increasingly well-educated and well-skilled. Future conflicts will not be solely decided by force numbers and sizes, though these are obviously relevant, but it would also be influenced – to an increasing extent – by technology and know-how.

We have established Work-Learn schemes for several critical skills-based SAF vocations. Eligible NSFs can join these schemes to receive accredited training and education from Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), whilst performing their NS roles. The Servicemen benefit from these qualifications and the work experience gained.

Four years on, there are now 130 Servicemen enrolling in Work-Learn schemes every year, serving as cyber specialists, as well as Air Force and Army Technicians. In the years ahead, we expect to expand the Work-Learn schemes to cover more roles and vocations, based on the SAF’s operational requirements. At steady state in 2025, we expect 500 Servicemen to enrol in Work-Learn schemes every year. This year, the SAF will introduce another two Work-Learn schemes. One is the Digital Work-Learn scheme for eligible Servicemen to pursue undergraduate degrees in areas, such as Computer Engineering and Data Science.

I would like to highlight a key change arising from the NSRC’s recommendations. When we launched the Expertise Conversion Scheme, or ECS, in 2014, the landscape was one where expert roles tended to be at the officer level. Eight years on, we have expanded beyond that and we have expanded expertise deployment across all levels, including roles that are assumed by Warrant Officers, Specialists and Enlistees.

At present, the filing of such claims is done manually by NSmen and their employers. Later this year, MINDEF will introduce an automated system which draws on income-related information from CPF Board and IRAS to compute the Make-Up Pay amounts. NSmen and their employers will be provided the opportunity to review the computed amounts to see if they agree. If no objections are raised, the amount will then be paid out to them automatically. For the bulk of NSmen and their employers, this greatly simplifies the process and saves time. Those who believe that the computed amounts are not up-to-date can certainly submit additional information for recalculation, so that the right amounts are paid out.",18,94,014-001-095-053-010-094,192

As mentioned by Minister Ng Eng Hen, along with automating Make-Up Pay computation, we will be implementing a base NS pay. Starting later this year, all NSmen will receive at least $1,600 for every month of In-Camp Training that they are required to attend.

I am pleased to announce that the first phase of the OneNS platform will be rolled out later this year. This will replace the existing NS Portal and will provide a more seamless experience for our servicemen. Our National Servicemen perform several transactions with MINDEF/SAF throughout their NS journey. The idea is to centralise these transactions and essential NS services onto the OneNS platform and render it more accessible via a single mobile application or a revamped web portal. For a start, NSmen can look forward to enhanced Call-Up and Deferment eServices, to facilitate preparation for ICT.

Since November last year, MINDEF has been disbursing the NS Excellence Awards and Celebratory Gifts in the form of e-credits that can be accessed via LifeSG. In the past, recipients received their benefits in the form of physical vouchers. With this change, they are now able to receive and redeem these credits conveniently via the use of their mobile devices. The credits can be used at both online and brick-and-mortar shops that accept payment by PayNow QR. Thus far, through surveys, we found that 97% of surveyed users had reported satisfaction with this improvement. Come April this year, servicemen will also be able to use their credits with merchants that accept NETS QR.

Every soldier must play his role, too. The SafeGuardian mobile application, which I spoke about at Committee of Supply (COS) 2020, has played a significant role in enabling our servicemen to report safety hazards and near misses in a timely manner.

Today, 91% of our total population is fully vaccinated and 68% have received their booster shots. I am heartened that many have stepped up in support of our national vaccine effort. One example is National Serviceman Captain Dr Shane Abucewicz-Tan, a medical officer for the Home Vaccination Team, who supported COVID-19 operations. He conducted household visits as part of the Home Vaccination Programme, ensuring that Singaporeans who were immobile and immunocompromised could receive their vaccinations.

A study by Check Point Research found that Singapore saw a 145% increase in cyberattacks from 2020 to 2021. The healthcare sector was the most targeted sector. Throughout the pandemic, fear-mongers have spread falsehoods about variants and the ill-effects of vaccines, which have directly threatened public health and, if not, weakened trust.

We asked them how Total Defence might better rally Singaporeans in times of crisis and this was even before the Ukraine situation happened. From these conversations, we learnt that Total Defence has room to be more resonant and relatable, even as the actions within the six pillars remain relevant. Some found it too abstract, prescriptive and focused on present-day threats at the expense of emerging challenges, while some others did not want to be told what Total Defence was about.

Quite frankly, I have told my American interlocutors on numerous occasions, it was a mistake for the US to pull out of the TPP. It is still the highest level and most ambitious Free Trade Agreement with safeguards not only for trade, labour, the environment, intellectual property; and the rest of it. But all my interlocutors in America have said they cannot do it because of domestic political reasons. In a sense, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework is an alternative which they are trying to put beef on this framework. Let us see and let us encourage them. But as I have said, the key point I keep making and, in fact, the Prime Minister has made to multiple Presidents in Asia, trade is strategy. So, let us watch how progress is made on this front.

With global economic integration and the expansion of cross-border capital and trade flows over the last century, the fortunes of all countries and all peoples are now increasingly interdependent.

Under this unique bilateral arrangement, Singapore residents can make urgent trips to Malaysia to visit immediate family members who are critically ill, or to pay their last respects, without serving the full quarantine duration in Malaysia. Malaysia residents can similarly use the DCEV scheme to visit immediate family members in Singapore for similar reasons. Last September, MFA and MOH launched dedicated vaccination channels for overseas Singaporeans which made it more convenient for them to return home for inoculation.

Hon Members may be familiar with the German Parliament’s investigation into the shortcomings of the Wirecard’s auditors. By the way, the CAD has investigated Wirecard, too, which involves alleged losses of more than €1 billion and prosecution in Singapore is currently afoot. The report concluded that the auditor did not maintain sufficient professional scepticism and this led to it accepting documents and instructions without sufficient scrutiny. There must be better alignment between the auditor’s role currently and the investing public’s expectations.",12,13,014-001-095-053-012-013,549

I suggest we beef up manpower internally and be more open to engaging other experts from the outside. CAD is operating in a challenging environment on a day-to-day basis. Despite that, it is doing a very good job in bringing offenders of complex white-collar crimes to book. As legislators, we need to ensure that CAD is sufficiently resourced so that investigations into complex white-collar crime are conducted fully and with due dispatch.

The Government's position was spelt out by the hon Minister on 5 October 2020. He said that in determining whether to apply the death penalty to a particular offence, the Government takes into account three considerations in totality  seriousness of the offence; how widespread the offence is; and the need for deterrence. Applying these considerations, the main offences for which the mandatory death penalty is imposed are intentional murder, gang robbery with murder, trafficking of significant quantities of drugs, terrorist bombing and use of firearms. The Government’s approach has resulted in Singapore being one of the safest places in the world – something that is deeply valued by Singaporeans.",15,16,014-001-095-053-012-016,552

Drug couriers convicted of capital drug trafficking offences who have been issued with certificates of substantial assistance to curtail drug trafficking activities or found to be suffering from abnormality of mind would be imposed with life sentences instead of the mandatory death penalty. In addition, the death penalty would only be imposed as a mandatory sentence for intentional murder.

Of the remaining 22, eight persons were imposed with life imprisonment on the basis that they were suffering from an abnormality of mind. The Court imposed the death penalty on 14 persons.

The number of persons subjected to the mandatory death sentence has been reduced significantly. Nonetheless, there could be a watering down of the deterrent effect of the death penalty for drug trafficking. I, therefore, ask whether there has been any deterioration on the part of the Home Team’s ability to keep our drug situation under check. If there is no deterioration, may I ask whether the Government is prepared to consider extending the issuance of certificates of substantial assistance to cover cases where drug couriers whose death penalties have been affirmed on appeal?",18,19,014-001-095-053-012-019,555

The world is changing and geopolitical tensions are ratcheting up to levels that have not been seen in recent memory.

Does it reside with the CPIB, which is what the Home Affairs Minister’s reply suggested? If so, does the CPIB proactively assess risks of foreign interference against Ministers or does it act only reactively, if complaints are lodged? Are there officers in the CPIB with the necessary skills and expertise to investigate possible foreign interference?",4,34,014-001-095-053-012-034,570

An example is a partnership between PERSES, the Sepaktakraw Federation of Singapore, and the Dadah Itu Haram campaign. As Senior Minister of State Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim has said about this collaboration, it was a step showing how the rest of the sports community could join in the anti-drug effort.

A study commissioned by MHA in 2019 on the views of Singapore residents found that the majority felt that the death penalty was more effective than life imprisonment for serious crimes, including drug trafficking. Another study in 2018, this time on a sample of non-Singaporeans who were likely to visit Singapore came to similar conclusions.

We institutionalised it such that the CPIB can go straight to the Prime Minister but, where the Prime Minister himself is the possible subject of investigations, or if the Prime Minister does not want to do something, the CPIB can go to the President.

While we can understand that whistle-blowing will encourage more people to step forward to help detection, there are also other considerations that we need to consider.

I made a long speech, which I do not intend to and I cannot anyway repeat, in September 2020 when I gave detailed arguments for an ombudsman, I addressed the objections to the idea, one by one. I talked about the countries that have that. Many countries do incorporate this institution. And if you were to go to opinion leaders, and if you were to conduct public opinion polls in those countries, I am not at all sure that the majority of people would say that, ""Well, this is a bad thing, let us remove this institution and then things will get better"".

And then, thereafter, Minister went on to say that in the case, for example, for intentional murder, 81% approved of the mandatory death penalty.

And I want to say that as a lawmaker, it is one of the toughest decisions that I have to make for my country whenever the Misuse of Drugs act comes up, if not the toughest and I have searched my conscience and I am fully in favour of the retention of the death penalty.

We established a standing LTP Industry Engagement & Advisory Group to provide continuous feedback as the product is developed and redeveloped over phases.

This enables us to have a uniform platform, one that is internationally-recognised, on which we can say, if you have an IA or IP, this is the valuation methodology and this is how it will be recognised across different jurisdictions. This, in turn, will create more opportunities for IA/IP valuers in Singapore, anchor IA/IP valuation activities and thought leadership here and support Singapore as a trusted business and financial hub.

I am heartened to know that an IA and IP international valuation framework or standard will be developed in Singapore.

I thank the Minister for the announcement on the plans on simplifying the probate process. I just want to have one clarification. I think there is also the need to synergise with the Muslim law probate process as well because there is a need for Muslim intestate beneficiaries to also extract Syariah inheritance certification from the Syariah Court; and whether there will be also plans to synergise the two systems, so that there will be a seamless transfer of documents and the certificate from the Syariah Court to the Family Justice Court, which may be administering the family justice or the probate and the letter of administration process.",1,179,014-001-095-053-013-179,1189

The system of law governing inheritance may be different. But the administration is something that we can look at because both of the systems will require some degree of administration.

Be that as it may, may I ask what the Minister and MinLaw are doing to promote the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) rules, especially because arbitrations and hearings are increasingly being held via Zoom or online, so that the rules make all the difference to attract the case to SIAC?

2022-03-03,Committee of Supply – Head R (Ministry of Law),014-001-095-053-013,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"On the second query, yes, we have to ensure that we continue to put SIAC out there. We have to work hard at doing that, and part of this is also to ensure that SIAC remains in the mindshare. So, when we talk about forays into foreign jurisdictions, as we have done with Mr Murali Pillai, I think he was present on at least one of the trips overseas to speak about our rules, to talk about our system and to, basically, socialise the idea of using SIAC.

2022-03-03,Committee of Supply – Head R (Ministry of Law),014-001-095-053-013,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Second, I think it is important to ensure that we continue to have the best arbitrators in SIAC. We look at our Panel as one where we ensure that the best in the class, when it comes to arbitrators, are retained by SIAC – the best personnel, best expertise, best secretariat, to administer the cases. These are often the best advertisements, as it were, to ensure that parties, when they come to choosing the relevant rules, will come to choose SIAC rules and we can give them the best service.",3,186,014-001-095-053-013-186,1196

A good recent example is how the SG United Training scheme is administered by the Singapore Business Federation. The sectoral TACs can similarly take charge of sector-specific schemes, within parameters worked out jointly with the relevant Government body and with funding to support the costs incurred in administering the said programmes. The TACs' closeness with their industry’s companies will be useful in that it is easier for them to explain how each scheme works and increase these companies’ participation in beneficial programmes and grants.",3,124,014-001-095-053-015-124,1337

Specifically, the Code provides that veterinarians must consider other treatment options prior to considering euthanasia.
