Many groups from the community – business leaders, the grassroots, academia, media, just to name a few – have come up with ideas to pay tribute to Mr Lee this year. They felt it was important to remember Mr Lee’s contributions to Singapore and the ideals that he represented. They especially wanted to raise awareness of Mr Lee’s contributions amongst Singaporean youths, many of whom were very young or not yet born when Mr Lee stepped down from the Cabinet.",2,3,014-001-095-082-001-003,3

Some business leaders have also proposed setting up a fund for private donations that will go towards supporting educational causes.

For example, the National Heritage Board has an ongoing travelling exhibition for the Founders’ Memorial, as part of a public call for artefacts and stories from our nation-building years. Later this year, they will have a more extensive exhibition at the National Museum on key historical milestones our founding leaders rallied our people through. This year also marks the 60th year of Singapore’s greening journey since Mr Lee launched the first tree planting campaign in 1963 and NParks will have various activities to mark this milestone.

Efforts to mark the 100th anniversary of Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s birth should, as the hon Member Mr Sitoh said, serve to remind us of the values Mr Lee stood for and the ideals he and his fellow founding leaders fought for.

Such is the nature of the recent preliminary signal reported by one of the vaccine monitoring centres in the US about strokes in individuals aged 65 and above who have had the said vaccine.",1,2,014-001-095-082-002-002,9

In fact, HSA’s latest safety report showed that the incidence rate of severe adverse event after taking bivalent vaccines, at about one in 100,000, is lower than that of the original vaccines, at around seven in 100,000.",3,4,014-001-095-082-002-004,11

I have senior residents in Yio Chu Kang who have raised similar concerns about bivalent vaccines having higher risk of stroke. Hence, some are reluctant to take the bivalent vaccine. How will the Ministry work towards allaying some of these concerns and thereby, improving the take-up rate of the bivalent vaccine among our seniors?",1,7,014-001-095-082-002-007,14

Allaying such concerns will require a multi-channel, multi-stakeholder approach, as we have been doing for any issues and concerns around the vaccines and the vaccination programme from the start. The transparency of our processes, the information available from experts, academics and the professionals, the honest and complete discussion about risks and benefits – not that there are no risks, but the benefits significantly outweigh the risks – as well as that last-mile communication. I hope Members in this House can assist in that process of last-mile communication, taking the information provided by the Ministry of Health (MOH), by HSA, by the EC19V, by colleagues and replies in this House, and helping to convey to their residents as well.",1,8,014-001-095-082-002-008,15

I have one supplementary question for the Senior Minister of State. MOH had recently published figures on the number of individuals who have received payments under the Vaccination Injury Financial Assistance Programme (VIFAP). Of these individuals, may I know how many of them had suffered from an ischemic stroke after receiving the bivalent vaccine?",1,10,014-001-095-082-002-010,17

Among the subset of patients having received the vaccine who then subsequently received the VIFAP that she referred to, the data has been released, there were no cases of acute ischemic stroke. So, the short answer to her question is zero.",1,11,014-001-095-082-002-011,18

We monitor and look for safety signals across the entire population of people who receive the vaccines, who come to our clinics or centres, who receive medical care at our hospitals. And we are looking for that safety signal that this type of adverse event has increased. And it has not. That is the clear message that we want to send.",2,12,014-001-095-082-002-012,19

2023-02-07,"2023 Outlook for Inflation, Cost of Living and Singapore Dollar",014-001-095-082-003,The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"  Speaker, Singapore’s inflation outlook this year is dependent on both external and domestic factors. Externally, global inflation is likely to stay firm in the near term as global energy and food commodity prices remain elevated despite coming off their peaks in 2022. At the same time, labour markets in advanced economies remain tight, thereby keeping pressure on wages.",1,2,014-001-095-082-003-002,21

Meanwhile, housing rent and car inflation are projected to remain firm due to the strong demand for rental housing and tight COE quotas respectively.",2,3,014-001-095-082-003-003,22

For 2023 as a whole, the CPI-All Items inflation is projected to come in at 5.5% to 6.5%, compared to 6.1% in 2022. Over the same period, MAS Core Inflation – which excludes accommodation and private transport costs – is expected to average between 3.5% and 4.5%, compared to 4.1% in 2022.",3,4,014-001-095-082-003-004,23

MAS remains watchful of the near-term risks to inflation and growth. The agency will review our monetary policy in April 2023.",4,5,014-001-095-082-003-005,24

2023-02-07,"2023 Outlook for Inflation, Cost of Living and Singapore Dollar",014-001-095-082-003,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang),"  Thank you, Sir. I appreciate the proactive move by the MAS with the stronger Singapore dollar to help mitigate the imported inflation. We have also read about how the supply chain has stabilised, which hopefully, will not add new pressures to our inflation from external sources. I wish to ask the Minister of State how much inflationary pressure does he see coming from domestic sectors. In other words, how much of the inflationary pressure is domestically driven? Secondly, what more can we do to manage this domestic cost pressure, which the businesses are facing?",1,7,014-001-095-082-003-007,26
2023-02-07,"2023 Outlook for Inflation, Cost of Living and Singapore Dollar",014-001-095-082-003,Mr Alvin Tan,"  I thank the Member for his supplementary question. In fact, MAS was very pre-emptive in its response to the pick-up in inflation, having started monetary policy tightening in October 2021, even when global inflationary pressures were relatively modest. That is important. And just to give Members a sense, as at end January 2023, the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) has strengthened by 7.8% against a basket of currencies of our major trading partners, if you compare that to October 2021, when MAS first began tightening monetary policy.",1,8,014-001-095-082-003-008,27
2023-02-07,"2023 Outlook for Inflation, Cost of Living and Singapore Dollar",014-001-095-082-003,Mr Alvin Tan,"On domestic inflation, domestic inflation is related to external factors. So, if you look at the external front, you might have fresh shocks to global commodity prices such as those arising from worsening geopolitical tensions or a significant strengthening of demand following the reopening of China's economy. This, naturally, will result in higher domestic inflation, particularly for food and energy-related items.",2,9,014-001-095-082-003-009,28

2023-02-07,"2023 Outlook for Inflation, Cost of Living and Singapore Dollar",014-001-095-082-003,Mr Alvin Tan,"For labour costs, the Government is also co-funding the wage increases of lower-wage workers for five years, from 2022 to 2026, under the Progressive Wage Credit scheme (PWCS). As part of this $1.5 billion support package announced in June, the Government's co-funding share of this 2022 PWCS support was enhanced from 50% to 75% for wages up to $2,500, and from 30% to 45% for wages above $2,500 and up to $3,000.",5,12,014-001-095-082-003-012,31

I thank the Minister of State for the answers he gave earlier. I just want to ask a broad, macro question. Can I have a sense of the Government's view of the growth and inflation bias for 2023 and into 2024 as well, especially with China reopening. The Minister of State has given a very extensive answer on inflation. But may I have a rough sense, what is the growth and inflation bias in terms of the outlook for 2023 and going into 2024?",1,15,014-001-095-082-003-015,34

2023-02-07,"2023 Outlook for Inflation, Cost of Living and Singapore Dollar",014-001-095-082-003,Mr Alvin Tan,"  As I mentioned in my earlier reply, CPI-All Items inflation is projected to be higher, as well as our core inflation, but the global market outlook is uncertain; in part, because of potential geopolitical tensions that we have been seeing in the news almost every day. There is also a softening of or normalisation of supply chains but it continues to be tight. We are still quite moderate in our expectations for growth, but at the same time, it is important for us to keep a longer-term view. That is why, for example, for the monetary policy to be proactive, for fiscal policy to be also supporting both our businesses as well as Singaporeans as a whole.",1,18,014-001-095-082-003-018,37

And, indeed, one of the motivations for me to ask the question was because I went for such a visit with my family, and what I observed was, in contrast to many other countries, the discount turns out to be a very small fraction of the total ticket price. More generally, it makes me wonder whether there could be a greater effort by the Government for either, perhaps, a one-off ticket that could be available for every household who are in the Singaporean Core so that they can at least experience these world-class attractions just once, or perhaps more substantial discounts for low-income families, because, right now, as far as I can gather from the site, the more substantive discounts are just for seniors.",1,5,014-001-095-082-009-005,133

First of all, the CI has to meet the donor in person.

In that meet-up process, the CI also verifies the donors' identity. I shall not go into details of how this is done.

It is actually a starter product that actually opens up doors to tobacco consumption and smoking and we need to have a harder push but we need efforts from all fronts – from parents, from teachers, from schools, from the community to encourage this effort. We are also rolling out a digital vape-free campaign and we are also hoping to get support from the community on this.",2,12,014-001-095-082-015-012,203

We work closely with the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and Health Promotion Board (HPB) to educate students on the harmful effects of using imitation tobacco products, including e-cigarettes and e-vaporisers. In schools, students learn about Singapore's laws and regulations on vaping and the consequences on individuals, families and society. Students in MOE schools also learn to recognise impulsive and addictive behaviour and are equipped with skills to say ""no"" to e-cigarettes and e-vaporisers as well as strategies for self-control and to manage negative peer influences. The Autonomous Universities (AUs), polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) also raise awareness among students about the harms of vaping and the benefits of leading a vaporiser-free lifestyle.",1,2,014-001-095-082-016-002,206

She tried and failed twice to get a Built-To-Order (BTO) flat in a non-mature estate. Given this, as well as the time factor, she is now looking at resale options, but resale prices are high. On top of the price, the cash plus the CPF upfront component that they need to pay to get a bank mortgage loan, or even a HDB loan is substantial.

But one simple truth is dawning on more and more Singaporeans. If HDB flat prices rise and rise, that inevitably tends to affect our house prices for the young. That is because land sale values from the state to HDB seem to be influenced by historical sale transactions and that in turn affects BTO prices. The fiscal capacity of the state to provide subsidies out of the Budget is not unlimited. Hence, the HDB flat lessee may realise some capital gain, but his or her children may be struggling in the housing market.",7,12,014-001-095-082-019-012,238

Facing these two realities, I think the time has come for us to reboot, refresh and reframe mindsets and start thinking of our HDB flats as primarily a home to live in, an affordable home and much less of an asset whose value will rise and rise in the same way that the value of, for example, developed country equities.

Plus, most are unwilling to take up the Lease Buyback Scheme, as most probably they want to leave their flat to their children, who they think will face even higher property prices in the future, which probably explains the scheme's low take-up.

2023-02-07,"Affordable and Accessible Public Housing, and Public Housing Policies",014-001-095-082-019,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Firstly, and most importantly of all, I would like to ask the Government if it still sees HDB flats as an ever-appreciating asset. More specifically, does the Government designate HDB flats as a retirement asset which necessitates their appreciation of the time even though the inherent nature of the finite lease requires that they must eventually depreciate and expire zero? Is this asset appreciation assumption still the centre of gravity of our housing policy?",21,26,014-001-095-082-019-026,252

There have been statements that prices may keep on rising even after year 70, for example from former Ministry of National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan in September 2018. And there was Deputy Prime Minister Mr Lawrence Wong's statement in 2017 that resale prices will eventually come down to zero as the lease decays. I will not quote the various statements that could be quoted, due to time limitations. That is my first question.",22,27,014-001-095-082-019-027,253
2023-02-07,"Affordable and Accessible Public Housing, and Public Housing Policies",014-001-095-082-019,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Secondly, what is the Government's view on the affordability of HDB flats? What in Government policy-making is the boundary line that divides affordability from unaffordability on a metric of housing affordability? One widely used housing portability metric is the median multiple or house-price-to-income ratio. This indicator was a primary indicator of the 1991 World Bank UNCHS housing indicator system and was used as a measure of how affordability by the UN Commission for Sustainable Development. Its use has been publicised by an organisation called Demographia which studies housing affordability. Demographia views a multiple 5.1 as severely unaffordable, 4.1 to 5 is seriously unaffordable, 3.14 is moderately unaffordable and under 3 is affordable.",23,28,014-001-095-082-019-028,254

Does it view, for example, anything under an HPI level of six as affordable, or HPI level of five as affordable? To be sure, I am not saying that the Government should accept the Demographia classification, but the Government should clarify what its stance on the HPI is.",29,34,014-001-095-082-019-034,260

Member of Parliament Louis talked about this. Clearly, the rate of formation of new households as a result of marriages, or even other kinds of events like divorces, is not something that changes drastically from year to year. It is demographic data that does not see sudden or radical changes in general. The Government controls most of the land in Singapore and hence, does not face impediments in terms of being able to acquire land to build HDB flats, unlike in many countries.",30,35,014-001-095-082-019-035,261
2023-02-07,"Affordable and Accessible Public Housing, and Public Housing Policies",014-001-095-082-019,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Why then do we get into situations where the supply of HDB BTO flats cannot keep up with demand. Where there is excess demand such that BTO projects are oversubscribed at increasing ratios as my hon friend, Louis Chua, has expanded on in detail and much demand that would go to BTOs ends up going instead into the resale market leading to resale price spikes? Why does demand and supply get mismatched? It is not just due to COVID-19 delays. This happened in the pre-COVID-19 past, too, at times. It would be useful if the Government can share its perspective on this and also share what it does to research and plan ahead to match supply with demand.",31,36,014-001-095-082-019-036,262

2023-02-07,"Affordable and Accessible Public Housing, and Public Housing Policies",014-001-095-082-019,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"First of all, Sir, I would like to suggest that the Government consider building some BTO flats sold at 70-year leases with the option to top up to another 29 years. This will allow BTO flats to be sold at a lower price. Such flats may also will better suit the life plans of many buyers.",38,43,014-001-095-082-019-043,269

2023-02-07,"Affordable and Accessible Public Housing, and Public Housing Policies",014-001-095-082-019,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"This would be another addition to the HDB ecosystem that widens choice to Singaporeans who may want very different things at different stages in their lives. In this proposal, payment for the optional additional 29-year period is made only upon the exercising the option, but the option payment is locked in from the day of the initial purchase.",40,45,014-001-095-082-019-045,271

2023-02-07,"Affordable and Accessible Public Housing, and Public Housing Policies",014-001-095-082-019,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Certainly, tiered BTOs like this would be sold at a significantly cheaper price due to the shorter lease duration. That cheaper price may make possible a shorter loan duration, which many would welcome as being less risky, given the vicissitudes of life. The CPF funds saved thereby would get compounded in the buyer's CPF accounts and boost retirement adequacy.",42,47,014-001-095-082-019-047,273

In comments HDB made to CNA in November last year said that it is already building ahead of demand or actual bookings where possible. Since May 2011, it has called for and awarded construction tenders for the majority of BTO projects ahead of the outcome of the flat selection.

These would be flats where there is no requirement to sell before construction starts.,50,55,014-001-095-082-019-055,281
2023-02-07,"Affordable and Accessible Public Housing, and Public Housing Policies",014-001-095-082-019,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"One objection to this proposal is what if the flats remain unsold for a long time? The cost of maintaining those empty flats would be a loss to the state. However, if such flats remain unsold, the selling price could be reduced until we reach a market clearing level where someone will buy – which is how markets operate. The risk of flats remaining permanently unsold is small once you consider this.",51,56,014-001-095-082-019-056,282
2023-02-07,"Affordable and Accessible Public Housing, and Public Housing Policies",014-001-095-082-019,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Moreover, HDB would obviously conduct market research before deciding to build certain flat types in certain locations, which would lower that risk even more.

Then, you work out a price based on that. There are other elements in that formulation as well.

This was referenced in the Workers' Party ""HDB Reforms"" paper. We had a section of it where we talked about what is the available evidence at the time the paper was written – which was November 2022. So, what is the available academic evidence out there were the reasons why the take-up rate for the LBS has been so low. My understanding of that is that there is some qualitative research that suggest that the bequest motive, parents wanting to leave the flat to their children, is a very, very important reason. I am not aware of any statistical survey that has been done – to be fair to Mr Pillai's question – but I believe that there is some qualitative evidence on the table.",1,91,014-001-095-082-019-091,317

Okay. So, I think in my speech, and to address Mr Pillai more holistically, other than wanting to leave your flat to your children, there is also the fact that not everyone wants to rent out their flat or is able to rent out their flat. In other words, not everyone is able to monetise their flats. So, if we build an ecosystem of policies where monetising your flat – because the price is high and appreciating – monetising your flat is going to be one of the key planks of retirement adequacy. Those people who want to keep the flat for their children, those people who do not want to tap on LBS, do not want to rent out their flat, will not be able to benefit from that plank of retirement adequacy.

Affordability and accessibility should be created by Government policies like grants, the provision of HDB loans, where possible, waivers of certain requirements and flexibility in imposing eligibility criteria, for example.

Mr Leong's proposal to charge for land upon sale simply does not make sense to me. He proposes that when the flat owner sells, the owner would be charged for the land costs, presumably at full cost calculated at the time of buying the flat. If HDB is not fully pricing for land when selling the flats, then surely, Mr Leong's proposal will result in a much higher charge to the owner when he sells the flat. How is the owner supposed to cough up the land costs when he sells the flat? Surely, he must pass on the costs to the next buyer.",8,245,014-001-095-082-019-245,471

He did not give any information about how he would price the location premium and whether this would make the flat even more expensive. No information. But it also begs the question, why does PSP want to charge a flat owner for land cost when HDB currently prices its BTO flats based on affordability and they apply significant grants on top of this?

If the buyer's children inherit the flat, if they were to decide many years later to sell the flat, they must pay the land cost plus interest charged over many years and perhaps even decades later. His children will be inheriting a huge debt as they cannot sell the flat without having to pay the land cost plus accrued interest.

Given that they have reached their three-year MOP, the couple contemplate selling their home to purchase a 4-room flat in the resale market to accommodate their growing family. After means testing, such a couple could be eligible for stage of life housing grant, which will help to further subsidise the cost of the 4-room resale.",19,298,014-001-095-082-019-298,524

However, many of my residents have shared their concerns – for example, a mother and her children who suddenly lost their home after a divorce and those living in 1-room rental flats, which is not suitable for children who are growing up.

As part of the programme to help low-income families, or those who wish to rent a flat through the PPHS scheme, can the Government consider an initiative to distribute housing cash vouchers? Such vouchers can complement the support provided by the Government to address the rental flat supply problem and can provide a quicker solution to a most pressing need. Indeed, this policy, if approved, should have a testing method and eligibility criteria such as an income limit, a maximum limit on the amount to be drawn out and consider whether it is appropriate for the Government to provide a repository of homeowners with additional rooms. In my view, such housing vouchers can provide more support for low-income Singaporeans and alleviate situations where there are no units available for them to rent. It also allows families to rent in locations closer to schools, workplaces or family support systems that they require.",27,306,014-001-095-082-019-306,532

Mortgage rates have doubled on average in developed countries in 2022.

In Malaysia, a policy paper has suggested that housing prices remain unaffordable for many residents.

And, that it would eventually have to be paid back to the past reserves. Whether it is now or whether it is later, it is still part. The land cost is still now part of the pricing of the HDB flat.

The BTO model was created to prevent the supply overhang in the 1990s from being repeated. And it has served us pretty well until recent times. The current waiting times are an anomaly. Prior to COVID-19, it was three to four years. Yes, a three- to four-year wait was less than ideal for some, but the model largely was passable for most.

But one fact is dramatically different. The BTO system today does not promise flats for buyers in two and a half years.

2023-02-07,"Affordable And Accessible Public Housing, and Public Housing Policies",014-001-095-082-021,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Sir, the quantum of subsidies the HDB allocates for the home ownership scheme is another important but less ventilated aspect of HDB policy when it comes to affordability. These are taxpayers' subsidies and they represent the ""loss"" that the HDB incurs on the HDB's home ownership programme. This loss is fully funded and made good by the taxpayer.

This fact alone, one that has significant fiscal implications – but also a fact the Government, to my knowledge has thus far, never canvass as a reason to raise taxes would make it important for the Government to provide a breakdown of the dollar value of taxpayer subsidies for the home ownership programme.

Based on the Minister's reply, it would appear that an applicant who succeeds in securing a BTO flat in a mature estate where flats can be significantly more expensive, benefits from more taxpayer subsidies than one who secures a flat in a non-mature estate. With respect to these taxpayer subsidies, a distinction between mature and non-mature BTO flats is important because any deployment and subsequent recovery of subsidies for the home ownership programme ought to be, in principle, equitable and progressive.",67,284,014-001-095-082-021-284,1079

In fact, Mr Leong and the PSP’s position seems also to have shifted, from pricing flats based on median incomes in the 2020 manifesto; to December 2022 where they proposed eliminating land cost totally from the cost of developing public housing; to today, a deferred payment scheme where owners pay the full cost of land with accrued interest only when they want to sell the flat, as we learnt yesterday.

He said  “An enlightened public leader will carefully weigh the pros and cons of each policy option, never downplay the trade-offs, never sacrifice the long-term benefits for short-term gratification.” He also cautioned all of us in this House that if we were to give in to the “appealing rhetoric that understates the trade-offs and real costs"", “eventually, it is still the people and the man in the street that suffer the most”.",20,21,014-001-095-082-023-021,1251

I just have two quick clarifications for the Minister. I am wondering if the Chief Valuer – and I appreciate that this is an independent office – is provided guidance by the Government that land designated for public housing should embed stronger public considerations; just like how land for other kinds of public priorities may differ from commercial uses? Would the Government then accept this valuation as acceptable for channelling into reserves and that this would not then constitute a raid on reserves that would require Presidential approval.",1,30,014-001-095-082-023-030,1260

And if the answer is indeed yes, and I will wait for the response, but what then would be the constraints behind the Government providing such guidance to the Chief Valuer? Because it surely already provides some form of guidance for different classes of land. And just for clarification, in my speech, I had mentioned that $1 pricing for land for road but that was actually for the Land Betterment Charge and not in the context of what I am suggesting public housing land be priced that.",2,31,014-001-095-082-023-031,1261

But he or she will apply the valuation principles that are accepted and value land on the basis of its use. Public housing land is zoned for public housing and I think the Chief Valuer would be in command of the necessary information to understand what public housing is about. We can share information with him or her, and it is available publicly.",1,32,014-001-095-082-023-032,1262

But it is always open for Workers' Party to make representations to the relevant departments to advance reasons why the Workers' Party's method of valuation is professionally acceptable.

Firstly, just to respond to Minister's reference to the working paper that we had and then subsequently a clarification for Minister. I think at that point in time, as Minister quoted, we did base our assumptions on an average household size of 3.3. And today, based on the latest data, it is 3.1.

So, in the context of supply of public housing, that would be from the BTO projects as one source and also from the USB as another source. So, that is the clarification.",3,37,014-001-095-082-023-037,1267

I just wanted to check – in the response to my Parliamentary Question in January, the Minister did say that over the last couple of years that there are already 2,000 to 3,000 Shorter Waiting Time flats within the BTO launches. So, just to double-check, is this consistent in that it will still be 2,000 to 3,000 in the next two years to 2025, or is Minister saying that it will be 4,000 to 6,000 – 2,000 to 3,000 plus 2,000 to 3,000?",4,38,014-001-095-082-023-038,1268

On his first point, I hope the Member understands where we are coming from and that we meant well when I said what I said earlier. We acknowledged that there is a high demand today. It is clear from the high BTO application rates across the board, but especially in mature estates and choice locations, that there is high demand. There is broad-based demand but there is also market psychology at work and COVID-19 had a lot to do with that. We and my colleagues and the construction industry are working very hard to make the land available, to take over land to develop public housing, to do the land preparation, to do the work expeditiously but safely and productively.",1,39,014-001-095-082-023-039,1269

To say both to PSP and the Workers' Party that, ""Oh, before COVID-19, you all should have anticipated, you should have done this and done that"", I think reeks of applying perfect hindsight.

So, when you see 5-room flats in Central Weave @ AMK, they are 5-room flats on different floors, and therefore, the price before grant is different. The comparable resale prices which is put right next to the BTO prices are again in a range because you have probably a variety of resale transactions around the area. You must also adjust for comparability. Some professional work needs to be done to adjust for tenure, adjust for condition, amenities, and so on, and these are professional matters.

The increase in the per unit land development cost can be attributed to the increase in the proportion of units delivered in mature estates, which tend to have a higher per unit land cost compared to non-mature estates, and the increase in proportion of larger flat types in non-mature estates delivered in FY2021/2022, which translated to a higher per unit land cost in non-mature estates.
