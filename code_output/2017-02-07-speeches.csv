2017-02-07,Fair Process for Termination Due to Poor Performance and Recourse for Employees,013-001-094-033-001,Mr Lim Swee Say," Mdm Speaker, employers who terminate employment contracts on the ground of poor performance have to be able to substantiate their claim of poor performance. The Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices makes it clear that employers who wish to terminate the services of employees on the ground of poor performance are to apply relevant and objective performance criteria. The criteria should be made known to all employees. Employers should also keep records of their employee's performance, and a decision to terminate the service of an employee should be based on documented poor performance. They key word is ""documented"". Where it involves a unionised employee, the union should also be consulted.",1,5,013-001-094-033-001-005,5
2017-02-07,Fair Process for Termination Due to Poor Performance and Recourse for Employees,013-001-094-033-001,Mr Lim Swee Say,"If the employee files an appeal of unfair dismissal to MOM, we will first mediate. Should mediation fail, we will conduct an inquiry and require the employer to show cause and produce evidence to justify the termination. This remedy is provided under the Employment Act, as well as the Industrial Relations Act for union members.",2,6,013-001-094-033-001-006,6

2017-02-07,Fair Process for Termination Due to Poor Performance and Recourse for Employees,013-001-094-033-001,Mr Lim Swee Say,"In the case of Surbana Jurong's recent exercise to terminate the services of 54 employees, the company has acknowledged that the process could have been better managed. The management and unions have since reached an agreement on an ex-gratia payment, which in our view is a fair outcome for the affected employees.",5,9,013-001-094-033-001-009,9

2017-02-07,Fair Process for Termination Due to Poor Performance and Recourse for Employees,013-001-094-033-001,Mr Lim Swee Say," Mdm Speaker, I agree fully with the Member. As far as the MOM is concerned, we expect all companies to behave in a responsible manner, especially the major employers, whether it is a GLC, MNC or large local enterprise or, for that matter, public services. MOM does expect all companies, but especially major employers, to conduct their HR practices in a responsible and progressive manner.",1,12,013-001-094-033-001-012,12
2017-02-07,Fair Process for Termination Due to Poor Performance and Recourse for Employees,013-001-094-033-001,Mr Lim Swee Say,"In this particular case, we are certainly concerned that a major employer could commit such an HR practice lapse. Looking forward, TAFEP is stepping up efforts to engage the employers out there, including the major ones. Members may be pleased to know that last year, I talked about our plan to set up a programme known as the ""Human Capital Partnership Programme"", which is to reach out to employers, especially the major ones, to work together to value our precious human resources in a more responsive, more sensitive, more constructive manner. That programme will be launched quite soon, within the next few weeks.",2,13,013-001-094-033-001-013,13

2017-02-07,Fair Process for Termination Due to Poor Performance and Recourse for Employees,013-001-094-033-001,Mr Lim Swee Say," Mdm Speaker, firstly, there is no need for the employees to have access to the documented proof. As long as an employee feels that he has been dismissed unfairly, he can just come to MOM. In other words, he does not need the cooperation of the employer. Just come to MOM and we will require the employer to produce the documented proof, failing which we will rule it as an unfair dismissal.",1,16,013-001-094-033-001-016,16

2017-02-07,Fair Process for Termination Due to Poor Performance and Recourse for Employees,013-001-094-033-001,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Secondly, termination exercises happen within the purview of the companies. MOM will come in only when either the union brings it to our attention or the affected employees come to MOM. This has been the approach because it is not possible for MOM to investigate whenever there is a termination exercise, big or small.",3,18,013-001-094-033-001-018,18

2017-02-07,Fair Process for Termination Due to Poor Performance and Recourse for Employees,013-001-094-033-001,Mr Lim Swee Say," Mdm Speaker, I share the concern of the Member. I spent many years with the Labour Movement and now with MOM. To the best of my recollection, this is the first time that an employer has conducted such a major termination exercise and to declare publicly and to label the workers as poor performers. This is something that, as the Manpower Minister, I do not find it acceptable. If the performance of the employees is not up to the mark, there could be contributing factors on the part of the employers as well. In other words, performance management should be a joint responsibility of employees and employers.",1,22,013-001-094-033-001-022,22
2017-02-07,Fair Process for Termination Due to Poor Performance and Recourse for Employees,013-001-094-033-001,Mr Lim Swee Say,"In most organisations, if it reaches such a stage whereby the employees and employers can no longer continue the working relationship, they will find a way to go separate ways, but you do not label the person publicly. The management realises this as well and that is why they publicly acknowledge that the way they conducted the exercise could be much better managed.",2,23,013-001-094-033-001-023,23
2017-02-07,Fair Process for Termination Due to Poor Performance and Recourse for Employees,013-001-094-033-001,Mr Lim Swee Say,"I hope to make clear to all employers out there, that when it comes to performance management, do it responsibly and, at the same time, do it sensitively. I hope that we will not come across another case where a company do a major termination and label the employees as poor performers publicly. At the end of the day, yes, it may be poor performance in one organisation, but it does not mean a person cannot do well in other places. As I had mentioned, the work environment, the HR practices and so on are also contributing factors.",3,24,013-001-094-033-001-024,24

2017-02-07,Pricing Mechanism for Build-to-Order Flats Sold Before and After Sale of Balance Flats Exercise,013-001-094-033-002,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong)," Mdm Speaker, new HDB flats offered under the Build-To-Order (BTO) and Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercises are priced using the same methodology, which takes into account the prices of comparable resale flats in the vicinity, as well as the specific attributes of the flats, such as storey height and design.",1,2,013-001-094-033-002-002,27
2017-02-07,Pricing Mechanism for Build-to-Order Flats Sold Before and After Sale of Balance Flats Exercise,013-001-094-033-002,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"However, the prices of SBF units may differ from that in the BTO exercise for several reasons. First, the SBF price may be slightly higher as the units are closer to completion. Second, the SBF prices may also be updated if there is a change in prevailing market conditions. For example, in cases where the prices of comparable resale flats in the vicinity have softened since the time of the BTO launch, the prices of balance flats may be lower than their original BTO prices.",2,3,013-001-094-033-002-003,28
2017-02-07,Pricing Mechanism for Build-to-Order Flats Sold Before and After Sale of Balance Flats Exercise,013-001-094-033-002,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"Regardless of whether the flats are sold under BTO or SBF exercises, HDB gives a generous market discount to ensure that new flats are affordable to buyers. On top of the subsidised prices, eligible first-timer families can also receive up to $80,000 in housing grants to help them purchase their flats.",3,4,013-001-094-033-002-004,29

2017-02-07,Pricing Mechanism for Build-to-Order Flats Sold Before and After Sale of Balance Flats Exercise,013-001-094-033-002,Mr Lawrence Wong," Madam, first of all we should compare like for like. As I had mentioned, pricing can differ due to various reasons − a higher floor unit will be more expensive than a lower floor unit, and there are different characteristics of location as well. So, let us take all of that aside. Because if you take all of that aside, and you say an SBF unit and a BTO unit in the same flat, same floor, most of the time, they will be similar. But there may be instances, as I have explained earlier, where the SBF unit is sold at the later stage and if indeed market has softened − it does not happen very often because our market is generally quite stable − but if indeed market conditions have softened, then HDB may sell that SBF unit at a later stage, due to market conditions, if the general market has softened, it may be sold at a slightly lower price, than the original BTO price. That is the reason that I had stated earlier.",1,6,013-001-094-033-002-006,31
2017-02-07,Pricing Mechanism for Build-to-Order Flats Sold Before and After Sale of Balance Flats Exercise,013-001-094-033-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I think that is fair to all home buyers because the transaction is done at the point of sale. If the market has come down, then we charge it at a slightly lower price. This is not a new practice. We have been doing it all this while. From BTO batch by BTO batch, sometimes the prices differ because of market conditions. Balance flats, as the market adjusts, we also update the pricing. This has been the practice of HDB's pricing all this while.",2,7,013-001-094-033-002-007,32

2017-02-07,Rate and Reasons for Rejection by Applicants to Select Flats in BTO or Sale of Balance Flats Exercise,013-001-094-033-003,The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong),"HDB shortlists flat applicants up to 300% of the flat supply. Depending on the flat supply and application rate, the average time taken to complete the selection of a BTO exercise and a SBF exercise is around six months and 10 months respectively. It takes longer for the SBF because the units are typically more spread out, more diverse, so more time taken to complete the SBF exercise. Flats which are not booked will be consolidated for offer in future SBF exercises.",3,4,013-001-094-033-003-004,37

This allows them to make alternative housing plans, such as applying in the next BTO or SBF sales launches, or buying a resale flat on the open market. HDB has found this to be a better arrangement than having unsuccessful applicants stay in the queue, as the applicants may then end up having to wait for an even longer period of time, without any certainty that the flats will be available.",4,5,013-001-094-033-003-005,38

Such a configuration also takes into account the eventual demand for places as our population ages. But having said that, the Senior Group Home operators are also learning from the actual experience.

I have actual feedback from residents who are living in these Senior Group Homes or assisted living models that three tenants in one rental flat versus two tenants in a typical rental unit is really very crowded, especially, as the Minister has said, if wheelchairs are involved, and in the sharing of common facilities like the toilet in the rental unit. So, I would really appreciate if the Minister could take a look and examine this model again to see if this can just be on par with the occupancy number in a typical HDB rental flat; and when can it be done?",1,13,013-001-094-033-005-013,63

Firstly, with regard to occupancy numbers, I have actually visited the Senior Group Homes and have also spoken to the residents there. I understand the concerns with regard to flat size. Indeed, the sizes do vary. The flats do vary in size and layout, and also when there are wheelchairs and walking aids involved as well, we will have to take that into consideration.",1,17,013-001-094-033-005-017,67

I think these various programmes are very important because of the need to cultivate an entrepreneurial sense and inclination so that we can develop local SMEs as a strong third leg to the economy.

It seems that for this particular programme, the Yes! grant and also the other programme which is the 50 SMEs Initiative, which I asked a separate written question about, the model seems to be one of a ""pull"" model where the schools and the students can elect to participate and make use of the fund and resources. But would the Ministry consider more of a ""push"" model, so that all schools and all students will at minimum be required to engage in at least some activity that exposes them to the entrepreneurial world. It need not be a very high-level activity like an attachment where you should opt in, but it could be a very basic exposure like a tour of some local companies, talks or taking part in some basic activities.",2,9,013-001-094-033-011-009,135

It is not so much a matter of establishing escrow accounts because the scenario painted by the Member is one where you have a main contractor and the employees, and then you have sub-contractors, and they have their employees. Each company will have other creditors as well. So, it is very difficult to say that I put this aside only for the employees, and it is difficult for the Government to do that. If the company itself sets aside monies in a certain escrow account and specifically stipulates that this is for employees, then that is something that the company can do.

2017-02-07,Impact of Growing Practice to Hire Freelancers on Wages and Retirement Planning,013-001-094-033-015,Mr Lim Swee Say," Mdm Speaker, we have not done a comprehensive analysis. However, if you look at, for example, home ownership, between the freelancers versus the full-time employees, there is no significant difference in the rate of ownership. For the freelancers, we may ask them through informal surveys, ""How do you prepare for your housing and retirement?"" They will say, ""Look, since I do not contribute to OA and SA, I have saved for it myself."" If you ask the taxi driver, ""Do you save enough to pay for your housing?"" He will say, ""Yes, I have."" ""Are you saving enough for your retirement?"" He will say, ""Yes, I am."" This is based on the present situation.",1,13,013-001-094-033-015-013,185

2017-02-07,Impact of Growing Practice to Hire Freelancers on Wages and Retirement Planning,013-001-094-033-015,Mr Lim Swee Say,"And this is the reason why we thought it is timely now to start a new series of surveys to really go in-depth to understand the issues. We are not jumping to any conclusion at this moment because, firstly, we would like to know whether more and more of them are primary freelancers or secondary freelancers. Based on our initial findings from the first survey, it would appear that the number of primary freelancers did not increase significantly. Any increase might have come mainly from the secondary freelancers. In other words, with the growth of the sharing economy, workers who have their primary employment are now taking advantage of sharing platforms to earn additional income, which may not be a bad thing. But as I have said, I do not prejudge the outcome of our analysis at this moment.",4,16,013-001-094-033-015-016,188

To overcome this challenge, we expanded the scope of PCPs under the Adapt and Grow initiative last year to allow for conversion to different jobs within the same sector, as well as to different jobs within the same company for sectors with high risks of redundancy. We also the extended the coverage of PCPs to most sectors − with 50 PCPs at the end of 2016, compared to 22 at the start of the year. So, last year alone, we increased the number of PCPs from 22 to 50, covering almost every sector of the economy now.",2,3,013-001-094-033-016-003,192

About one-third of those unemployed and managed to find jobs were unemployed for more than six months, meaning they are long-term employed. In terms of breakdown by PMETs and the rank-and-file, again, there is a good balance of about 50 50.",1,10,013-001-094-033-016-010,199

But, certainly, I would agree with the Member that for professional conversion, it is more likely that the more mature PMETs may find greater difficulties in going through this professional conversion.",2,11,013-001-094-033-016-011,200
2017-02-07,Effectiveness of Matching and Retraining under Professional Conversion Programme,013-001-094-033-016,Mr Lim Swee Say,"For example, one observation we made so far is that the majority of the PCPs actually start at the entry level. In other words, you move from one profession to another profession, but the majority of them end up starting from the entry level of the new profession. So, this may actually discourage the mature PMETs, because for them to start all over again at the bottom of the new career may be too painful. This is an area that MOM has looked into, whether we should strengthen and enhance the PCPs. You may hear something at the COS this year.",3,12,013-001-094-033-016-012,201

Broadly speaking, I would say that the success rate is about 60%. This is for all programmes; we do not keep track of the success rate by individual programme. We look at the number of PMETs who come to us, and I stand to be corrected, we were able to match 60% of them successfully to jobs. But it does not mean that the other 40% are jobless, because many of them will go through their own efforts, such as applying for jobs through the National Jobs Bank.",4,13,013-001-094-033-016-013,202

In some cases, we have more supply than demand, meaning there were more jobseekers but fewer job openings from employers and, in some cases, the other way around. So, what the MOM, together with our tripartite partners, is trying to do is to minimise this mismatch. Again, at the coming COS, we intend to make further enhancements to the Adapt and Grow initiatives to minimise this mismatch between supply and demand.",1,15,013-001-094-033-016-015,204

So, clause 5 now makes it an offence for any person to release or abandon animals into watercourses outside of our nature reserves, if the person knows or ought to know that these watercourses flow into the reserves.

Presently, very technical specifications, such as the dimensions of planting areas that surround buildings, are set out in the Parks and Trees Act. These requirements cannot be modified or waived, even by the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation. Sometimes, this hinders the adoption of innovative greenery proposals like vertical planting. Clause 11 will give NParks more flexibility. It transfers the prescription of dimensions of planting areas from the Parks and Trees Act to subsidiary legislation.

2017-02-07,Parks and Trees (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-033-022,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"Let us begin with the scope of protection. The Bill defines ""marine park"" as ""any area of the sea or seabed that is set aside for conservation of marine organisms and is designated in Part III of the Schedule"". So far so good, as the marine park seems to take on the characteristics of ""national park"" and ""nature reserve"", being set aside for conservation, and designated with its own Part in the Schedule.",6,40,013-001-094-033-022-040,316
2017-02-07,Parks and Trees (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-033-022,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"However, the ""marine park"" is then parked, forgive the pun, under the definition of ""public park"". Now, there are two national parks, Fort Canning Park and the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Singapore Botanic Gardens, and four nature reserves, the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Labrador Nature Reserve, and Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve. These areas are set aside for conservation of our natural heritage, scientific research, outreach and dissemination of knowledge, and educational purposes. These are exactly aligned with the purposes of the marine park, to serve as a platform for conservation, research, outreach and education on our marine biodiversity. So, why is our only and very unique marine park not placed with our national parks and nature reserves, but lumped with over 300 public parks?",7,41,013-001-094-033-022-041,317

I understand that in any nature conservation effort, outreach and education are important to get public support. The intertidal walks, the trails, the planned boardwalk and the floating pontoon at Big Sister's Island complement the conservation effort. However, they do expose the fragile marine eco-system to human footfalls and the natural temptation to touch and collect. Furthermore, as a public park, the marine park is exposed to visitors in private boats who could swim and snorkel freely among the reefs. Designating the marine park as a nature reserve, and not just any public park, will signal to visitors to give due respect to the marine biodiversity.",10,44,013-001-094-033-022-044,320
2017-02-07,Parks and Trees (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-033-022,Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member),"There is one more reason why the marine park needs the protection of a nature reserve, even more so than a terrestrial nature reserve. The boundaries of a terrestrial nature reserve such as Sungei Buloh could be carefully guarded against human intrusions using well-designed fences, walls, roads, hedges, waterways or secondary forests. However, the marine park is by nature a very open space given its location in the open seas. As our marine park gathers fame, our marine biodiversity could become a target of unscrupulous poachers and collectors. One major threat to coral reefs and reef fishes is poaching for the aquarium hobby market. We need to empower the custodian, NParks, to guard the marine park against this threat.",11,45,013-001-094-033-022-045,321

The marine park covers 40 hectares around Sisters' Island and the reefs off the western coasts of Pulau Tekukor and St John's Island. The Blue Plan had a far more extensive list of areas with high marine biodiversity, which included many islands and reefs adjacent to the marine park, such as Pulau Hantu, Pulau Semakau, Pulau Biola, the Cyrene Reefs and Kusu Island. Expanding the marine park to cover these areas with submerged reefs would greatly enhance and deepen the protection of our marine biodiversity.",12,46,013-001-094-033-022-046,322

The marine park, as it is designated now, is not a contiguous zone of protection, but split into three parts off Sisters' Islands, St John's and Pulau Tekukor. Unrestricted shipping poses a threat to the separated pockets of marine biodiversity. Just last year, in August, a collision between a Very Large Crude Carrier and a container ship close to the Sisters' Island brought on fears of an oil spill that would have been disastrous for the marine park. Buffer zones providing for secondary protection, not unlike the proposed amendment to create a new offence of releasing animals into a reserve through waterways outside the reserve, would mitigate the risks.",14,48,013-001-094-033-022-048,324

Some might argue that a matter such as this does not warrant such consultation and that it might overburden NParks to build this into NParks' regular procedures.

Many of these are large-scale developments like condominiums and strata landed housing. This amendment regulating the release or abandonment of animals into reserves through waterways is a good one, but it does not address one major issue, which is the potential of invasive species entering the reserves, not by design or choice, but by random chance, such as nonindigenous declarative plants favoured by condominium developers re-producing in the reserves, or exotic pets owned by residents, escaping accidentally into the reserves without the conscious choice of the residents to release them. These incidents may disrupt the reserves' delicate eco-system and biodiversity.

And previous arrangements have been such that they are very fearful as they come close to the renewal of their leases, whether they can continue or they will have to close their businesses. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State if he can allay the fears of the landscaping industry. It is very land intensive and very capital intensive.

Would trees that regularly shed leaves that might be a hazard on a slippery floor during rainy days, be considered ""dangerous?""

2017-02-07,Parks and Trees (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-033-022,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh)," Mdm Speaker, creating and maintaining green spaces in a densely built city state like Singapore has always been a challenge. I would like to applaud the NParks for the great job it has done in ensuring the accessibility and protection of green spaces.

2017-02-07,Parks and Trees (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-033-022,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Prolific urban planning has led to a boom of construction projects around Singapore. Some of these projects would involve the removal and transplanting of trees. I understand that NParks takes a keen interest in heritage trees, as well as tree removal and transplantation. Extensive consultations would take place between the project management team of the construction projects and NParks with regards to these matters.",3,130,013-001-094-033-022-130,406
2017-02-07,Parks and Trees (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-033-022,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"However, I have received feedback from residents in my constituency that the trees in the vicinity of construction works are sometimes not cared for properly by the respective construction teams, or even damaged. Examples include improper trimming and pruning, as well as defacement of trees. Perhaps NParks can step in to monitor the work of contractors and their appointed arborist, and be accorded the authority to take action when necessary.",4,131,013-001-094-033-022-131,407

And it is good that they would like to maintain a garden at their own expense, considering that it means additional green spaces as well as fresher air in the neighbourhood. However, some property owners lack consideration for their neighbours, and as a result, common disputes among neighbours living in the private property estates often involve inappropriate placement of trees.",5,132,013-001-094-033-022-132,408

However, in cases where there is a clear violation of regulations stipulated by the Ministry of National Development, would it not be more appropriate for someone, such as NParks, to intervene? I would imagine that the regulations are in place for good reasons, mostly safety-related, and it would make more sense to deal with it as soon as possible, rather than using authoritative power as a last resort.",6,133,013-001-094-033-022-133,409

Some plants like cacti are top favourites in landscaping works because they are hardy and aesthetically pleasing. However, some species can grow very big and may cause safety hazards and obstruction. If a resident notices potential issues arising from a non-tree type of plant, can NParks be called upon for assistance?",7,134,013-001-094-033-022-134,410

Some of these grass-cutters or tree-cutters come and do the work on a lovely Sunday morning and disrupt the peace with noise from their machines, when most residents would have liked to enjoy a peaceful morning jog or stroll, or even sleep in. The leaf blowers are the worst culprits. Their noise level goes up as high as 100 decibels (dBA), and then sometimes last half an hour or more. This exceeds the stipulated safety restrictions by MOM, which dictates that for the safety of workers, exposure to 100 decibels (dBA) should not exceed 15 minutes.",8,135,013-001-094-033-022-135,411

One, existing, largely optional outreach efforts to our children will naturally attract those who are already pre-disposed to nature, or to children whose school leaders see the benefit of interacting with nature.

In addition to green buffers, we also have established buffer parks, like the soon to be established Thomson Nature Park that Mr Henry Kwek talked about and other buffer parks around nature reserves. These buffers, as well as buffer parks and nature parks, help to shield the core of the nature reserve from urban life. They help protect the nature reserve from the desiccating effects of buildings and concrete and traffic. But they also give NParks the opportunity to go into these buffers to remove alien plant species, conduct animal species surveys and to remove invasive species that have been deliberately or accidentally released from these developments into the nature reserves.

One is on scope and one on scale. And the first one is that I appreciate that a lot of protection will practically be there but there is also the signalling and symbolic function of legislating the marine park as nature reserve. So, would the Government be open to allowing the management of the marine park to evolve just as Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, and to be eventually be enshrined legislatively, in law, as a nature reserve in the future?",1,257,013-001-094-033-022-257,533

Today, there is a time bar on the prosecution of insurance-related offences.

But it was when LTA announced in August last year that it was launching autonomous mobility-on-demand trials that really caught the imagination of many Singaporeans. I recall that this was followed by an announcement by nuTonomy, one of companies that LTA was in collaboration with under the Singapore Autonomous Vehicle Initiative, that it was launching the world's first-ever public trial of a ""robo-taxi"" service. This followed, a month later, with another announcement of nuTonomy's partnership with Grab, one of South-East Asia's leading ride-hailing app, to expand its public trial.",6,313,013-001-094-033-022-313,589

Amending the Road Traffic Act will enable emerging transport services to be safer and more reliable.

Driverless car technologies may solve the problem of manpower shortage in the future, and private car booking services may provide more choices to consumers.

Part of this Bill seeks to add enforcement powers to regulate private hire car services. Since Uber and Grab entered the Singapore market in 2013, we have witnessed a shift in commuter behaviour, as well as a great number of people becoming freelance drivers driving private hire cars. Many tech-savvy commuters have used these mobile apps and, coupled with sweeteners, such as promotional discounts and the absence of midnight surcharge, this development has been good news for commuters.",1,418,013-001-094-033-022-418,694
2017-02-07,Parks and Trees (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-033-022,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"However, there are other aspects of the transport ecosystem we have to consider. Many taxi drivers I have spoken to have indicated that their monthly income has taken a hit due to competition from Uber and Grab. Some of them are not so tech-savvy and are not able to switch to driving Uber or Grab, which requires the use of smart phone features. As commuters increasingly shift their preference to these private hire car services, the traditional taxi drivers have picked up fewer passengers. Many have thrown in the towel and, worse, some are unable to find other jobs as replacement. In fact, several countries and cities have applied certain restrictions or banned Uber and other similar services due to the severe market disruptions they have caused. Car rental companies have also lamented that Uber's affiliate, Lion City Rental, is charging lower than traditional market rate. Backed by large funds, Uber is focusing on growing its market presence with no consideration as to whether its operations are profitable or not.",2,419,013-001-094-033-022-419,695

2017-02-07,Parks and Trees (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-033-022,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"Madam, allow me to share some of Uber's financials. Uber's losses in the first six months of 2016 was roughly US$1.4 billion and it is projected that its full year loss would hit a record US$3 billion. In 2016 alone, Uber raised close to US$5 billion in equity and debt to fund its expansion. Despite our preferred stand of adopting a balanced, light-touch regulatory stance that Minister Ng has pointed out, our local players, with less financial clout and operating in a much smaller market, have definitely been affected.",4,421,013-001-094-033-022-421,697

2017-02-07,Parks and Trees (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-033-022,Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang),"Another anomaly is that taxi companies have to meet the Taxi Availability standards introduced in 2013 in order to grow their fleet size, which is capped at 2% per annum, but Uber and other private hire car services have increased their fleet size at an aggressive rate without any restriction during this period. The number of rental cars has increased from about 19,000 in end-2014 to more than 51,000 by the end of last year, far surpassing our taxi population of 27,500. Even if we remove the 2% cap on taxi population growth, I am afraid it has become a moot point as in a Straits Times article on 15 January this year, it was reported that there are signs that the market has hit saturation point with more than 2,000 unhired private hire vehicles and taxis. As such, I would like to explore if it is possible to allow taxi companies to convert part of their taxi fleet into private hire rental vehicles. This will allow for better utilisation of their fleet.",7,424,013-001-094-033-022-424,700

I am not against competition, but I am sure everyone agrees that competition should be fair. We have seen how competition can help drive innovation and prevent complacency by the incumbents. Ultimately, we hope that sustained competition can help to improve service standards.

This is only appropriate as Singapore continues to experience economic growth and rising levels of affluence, penalties should also rise concurrently. Only then will penalties bring about the right ""pain level"", have the appropriate punitive effect, and continue to be an effective deterrent.

As such, this inclusion is timely and necessary for Singapore to remain at the forefront of innovation for driverless vehicles. However, I would like to raise the point that the maximum penalty of $5,000 for first-time offenders who obstruct driverless vehicles during trials is the same as the current penalty for first-time offenders of reckless driving.

For example, taxi drivers are required by their Code of Conduct to be properly-attired ‒ shirt, dark-coloured pants, covered shoes, and so on.

We take issues related to the safety of commuters very seriously. This is why we will be requiring private hire car drivers to obtain a vocational licence. And when we do so, this vocational licence framework will impose on private hire car drivers the same demerit point system that is currently applied across the taxi drivers today. Private hire car drivers will also have to abide, under this framework, to similar Conduct Rules as taxi drivers − cleanliness, dressing and all those. As we are not planning to license private hire car booking service operators for now, there will be no licencing fees.

A general suspension order has the same effect as a licence suspension. Like a licence suspension or revocation, the general suspension order is also a power of last resort to be applied only if they are serious and repeated breaches on our rules.

And as for a minimum age criterion, our view is that requiring PHC drivers to have a minimum driving experience of two years should be adequate to reasonably ensure passenger safety. And, the number of years of driving experience may, in fact, be more important than age.

2017-02-07,Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-033-024,Mr Ng Chee Meng,"I would like to clarify that GrabHitch and Schoolber are carpooling services, not to be confused with private hire car services. Our regulations allow a driver to use private vehicles to give rides to others travelling to the same destination or in the same direction as himself, and for the driver to collect a small fee on a cost recovery basis, not for profit. This is different from private hire car services, where the intent is for the drivers to provide rides as a source of income. Hence, we do not intend to regulate carpooling services. Commuters who are thinking of using such services should assess for themselves their own comfort with the services, in particular, service, including the Chihuahua case. Over regulation of this budding initiative will most likely curtail the growth between private arrangements. If they are not comfortable with such safety issues or have reservations, they may want to use licenced taxis or private hire car services or licenced school bus services, if they are really not comfortable with this pooling service.",41,42,013-001-094-033-024-042,789

The motor must also be cut off when the user is not pedalling. So, if there is no pedalling power, he really cannot get the vehicle to go faster. In our view, this is more akin to being a bicycle with power assistance. Thus, we have assessed that we do not need to mandate road safety training for PAB users. We will continue, of course, to work with the Traffic Police to educate PAB users on safe behaviour and practices, regardless of whether it is more like a motorcycle or more like a bicycle.

2017-02-07,Impact of Private Car Hire Growth on Taxi Drivers' Incomes,013-001-094-033-028,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"  In 2016, average monthly net earnings per taxi driver came down compared to the previous year, by about 6.2%. Notwithstanding this, in total since 2013, when the private hire car industry started to grow, average monthly net earnings per taxi driver are still up by about 4% in real terms, aided in part by falling energy prices. In addition, gross fare revenue per taxi has remained relatively stable since 2013.

This competition can be positive for taxi drivers. I note that taxi companies have recently introduced measures to the benefit of their drivers. Some companies have reduced taxi rentals, while others have introduced innovative rental schemes, including giving rental rebates based on the drivers’ performance. Taxi companies can also adjust their fares and surcharges if they assess that this would make their services more competitive and taking into consideration the impact on their drivers’ earnings. Indeed, I hope the taxi industry will rise to the competition through such changes and by enhancing the level and value of service provided.",4,5,013-001-094-033-028-005,831

This allows the management to focus on optimising long term returns, while being accountable to the Government through their Boards for their overall performance.
