2013-02-05,Distribution of COEs,012-001-090-003-001,The Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo),,1,3,012-001-090-003-001-003,3

2013-02-05,Distribution of COEs,012-001-090-003-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,"  Madam, Members have asked my Ministry to consider alternative ways to distribute COEs, to favour selected groups with access to cheaper COEs. We have studied these suggestions, whether they merit support and also if they stand a good chance of being implemented effectively.",1,5,012-001-090-003-001-005,5
2013-02-05,Distribution of COEs,012-001-090-003-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,"First, to Ms Mary Liew's question, car ownership has increased significantly. Today, about 45% of all households own a car. That is nearly one in two households. In 2000, around one in three households owned a car. We estimate that between 8% and 9% of households in Singapore have more than one car. In other words, fewer than one out of 10 households own more than one car.",2,6,012-001-090-003-001-006,6
2013-02-05,Distribution of COEs,012-001-090-003-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,"While we understand the intent of Dr Intan's suggestion to favour first-time car buyers, the main difficulty is that it is hard to say why a second-time buyer is always less deserving than a first-time buyer. Consider the perspective of a growing household where the grandparents have moved in to stay, or the family has had more children, and are planning to buy a bigger or second car. To this family, a COE system which favours first-time buyers would not be fair. They would argue that their needs are greater than first-time buyers who are singles, or who have no children, or have no elderly members in the household. Consider also the needs of a business at an exciting growth phase, having built up a customer base which needs a second vehicle to service. To such business owners, their purchase of an additional vehicle is no less deserving than for a start-up buying its first vehicle.",3,7,012-001-090-003-001-007,7
2013-02-05,Distribution of COEs,012-001-090-003-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,"As a response to such a policy, the example of the family cited above may register the vehicle in the name of another family member who has not yet owned a car or a relative living in a different household. A business can easily set up a new subsidiary to own another vehicle as a first-time buyer. It is not hard to see how a COE allocation system which favours certain groups is likely to induce behaviour to get around the policy and defeat the purpose of the policy.",4,8,012-001-090-003-001-008,8
2013-02-05,Distribution of COEs,012-001-090-003-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In land scarce Singapore, unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of letting everyone own a car. We also cannot put car ownership in the same category as housing, health or education which are basic necessities. Our current Vehicle Quota System (VQS) is not a perfect system but still the most appropriate way to allocate a limited and non-basic resource.",5,9,012-001-090-003-001-009,9
2013-02-05,Distribution of COEs,012-001-090-003-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Let me assure Members that the Government is mindful of the wishes of Singaporeans to enjoy a high degree of mobility. The solution lies not in unrestrained growth of private car ownership but in improving our public transport and taxi systems. Therefore, we will focus our efforts and invest more resources on building up our mass public transport system -- more rail lines, more bus routes and more reliable services. We will also continue to encourage premium bus services and improve our taxi system to help bridge the gap between private and mass public transport.",6,10,012-001-090-003-001-010,10

2013-02-05,Car Ownership Trends,012-001-090-003-002,Mrs Josephine Teo,"  Madam, Ms Irene Ng asked about the growth trend and the household ownership profile of the car population in Singapore. Over the last five years, the car population increased by an average of 4% per annum from 514,694 cars at the start of 2008 to 617,556 cars at the end of 2012. The growth rate in the last two years has come down to 1.9% per annum, in line with the lower allowable vehicle growth rate. As of 2012, about 45% or nearly one in two households own a car, up from about 40% in 2008. We estimate that between 8 and 9% of households in Singapore have more than one car. In other words, fewer than one out of 10 households own more than one car.",1,4,012-001-090-003-002-004,16
2013-02-05,Car Ownership Trends,012-001-090-003-002,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Our Vehicle Quota System aims for sustainable growth in our vehicle population. Today, our road infrastructure already takes up close to 12% of our land space. Going forward, given our land constraints, we must endeavour to moderate further road growth. Hence, we decided to reduce the allowable vehicle growth rate from 3% per annum, which was the rate since we introduced the Vehicle Quota System in 1990, to 1.5% per annum in 2009, and we have further reduced it to 1% per annum in 2012 and to 0.5% per annum in February 2013.",2,5,012-001-090-003-002-005,17
2013-02-05,Car Ownership Trends,012-001-090-003-002,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Ms Ng also asked whether a study on the environmental impact of the growth of our car population has been conducted. This was done for the National Climate Change Strategy 2012, which is a multi-agency plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Singapore, including those from the transport sector. One of the measures introduced to reduce emissions from the car and taxi population is the Carbon Emissions-Based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS), which was implemented in January 2013.",3,6,012-001-090-003-002-006,18

2013-02-05,Affordability of New HDB Flats,012-001-090-003-003,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"  Madam, we build new flats to meet the housing needs of citizen families, especially those applying for HDB flats for the first time. Only citizen families are eligible to apply. They are heavily subsidised so that these families can afford them. This is to meet the strategic intent of helping Singaporean families own their homes.",1,4,012-001-090-003-003-004,23
2013-02-05,Affordability of New HDB Flats,012-001-090-003-003,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"The core principle for pricing these new flats follows from the strategic intent  their prices must be affordable for these families. In operationalising this principle, we set the price by taking into account the typical household income of these families, the market price of similar resale flats in the vicinity and the attributes of the flats including their size and location. We apply a substantial price discount to ensure that the flats will be affordable. In addition, to give eligible first-time home buyers a leg up, we provide them with significant housing grants of up to $60,000.",2,5,012-001-090-003-003-005,24
2013-02-05,Affordability of New HDB Flats,012-001-090-003-003,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"In this way, first-timers who buy new flats in non-mature estates will find them affordable. The quantum of the price discount and the size of the housing grants are within our control. By varying them, we ensure that we achieve the strategic intent of helping Singaporean families own their homes.",3,6,012-001-090-003-003-006,25

2013-02-05,Impact of Public Transport Fare Increases on Transport Workers' Salaries,012-001-090-003-005,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"  Madam, various Members have raised questions on the profitability of our public transport operators, public transport fare revision, and our public transport model.",1,9,012-001-090-003-005-009,42
2013-02-05,Impact of Public Transport Fare Increases on Transport Workers' Salaries,012-001-090-003-005,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Our public transport operators (PTOs) are profit-oriented entities and they are, on an overall basis, profitable. Unlike many of the nationalised systems, like for example, the London Underground or New York Metro, our PTOs are incentivised to keep costs down, to improve productivity, and also develop new revenue sources such as rental and advertising, so that they remain financially viable. If we restrict the ability of the PTOs to make profits, there will be less incentive for them to do all this. Ultimately, the concern is that this will lead to higher fares or larger Government subsidies, both of which are not to the benefit of Singaporeans.",2,10,012-001-090-003-005-010,43
2013-02-05,Impact of Public Transport Fare Increases on Transport Workers' Salaries,012-001-090-003-005,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Mdm Speaker, with your permission, I would like to request the Clerk of Parliament to give a handout to Members because we have put together a couple of tables to show the data of comparative studies on both bus and rail operations in Singapore to be among the most cost-efficient compared to other major cities, and that commuters in Singapore pay fares that are among the lowest Slide 1. These include cities which provide huge operating subsidies to run their public transport system. So, we have done a comparison with Hong Kong, London, New York as well as with Tokyo.",3,11,012-001-090-003-005-011,44
2013-02-05,Impact of Public Transport Fare Increases on Transport Workers' Salaries,012-001-090-003-005,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"In response to questions by Dr Lily Neo and Mr Baey Yam Keng, whatever we do to our public transport model, it must try to provide for cost efficiency and financial discipline, and having the PTOs that are commercial entities with a profit-orientation to run the day-to-day operations helps us achieve this. As for the public good considerations for the public transport system, this is the responsibility of the Government, in how we plan and invest public monies to build up a comprehensive and high quality public transport infrastructure, as well as to keep fares affordable.",4,12,012-001-090-003-005-012,45
2013-02-05,Impact of Public Transport Fare Increases on Transport Workers' Salaries,012-001-090-003-005,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Mr Gerald Giam asked whether the Government considers the Return on Equity (ROE) of the PTOs to be reasonable. Let me first say that the ROE is not the most appropriate financial metric to assess the level of profitability for PTOs. The ROE is actually a measure at the corporate level. It covers all of the company's businesses, including businesses which may not be related at all to their rail and bus operations, and their overseas businesses. More fundamentally, the ROE is also a function of a company's financial arrangements and capital structure. Hence, it does not always correlate closely to profitability at the operating level of a PTO's public bus and rail businesses, and these are the areas of which we are concerned. It would not be an appropriate measure to compare bus and rail profitability across different PTOs. For asset-heavy companies such as PTOs, a more common measure of profitability is the ROTA, or Return on Total Assets, which assesses the level of profits the company generates for every dollar of assets invested. This metric was also recommended by the 2005 Fare Review Mechanism Committee.",5,13,012-001-090-003-005-013,46
2013-02-05,Impact of Public Transport Fare Increases on Transport Workers' Salaries,012-001-090-003-005,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"SMRT and SBST's current ROTA for their public transport businesses are about 7.6% and 4.9% respectively, which are generally in a range we see for some other PTOs. And here I may wish to add that actually the profits from related non-fare revenue like advertising, rental and so on are included in the ROTA figures.",6,14,012-001-090-003-005-014,47
2013-02-05,Impact of Public Transport Fare Increases on Transport Workers' Salaries,012-001-090-003-005,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"I want to add also that even for the ROTA, there are limitations in its utility. First, the lumpy nature of investments needed for public transport, particularly for rail, means that we should avoid being overly-seized with the ROTA on a year-to-year basis. Secondly, the ROTA as currently determined for the PTOs does not include those assets which they are already using to generate revenue, but have yet to buy over from the Government.",7,15,012-001-090-003-005-015,48
2013-02-05,Impact of Public Transport Fare Increases on Transport Workers' Salaries,012-001-090-003-005,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"For instance, under the current financing arrangements, SMRT will need to invest in more trains for the North-South East-West Line (NSEWL), the Circle Line (CCL) and the Bukit Panjang LRT. SMRT also has to pay for the re-signalling project for the NSEWL. These are all major investments to which SMRT has either committed or are in the midst of implementing. In addition, under the CCL licence, SMRT would have to buy over from the Government the first set of operating assets in 2019.",8,16,012-001-090-003-005-016,49
2013-02-05,Impact of Public Transport Fare Increases on Transport Workers' Salaries,012-001-090-003-005,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"That said, we are mindful that the PTOs should not be earning excessive profits at the expense of commuters. Our public transport system is based on a balance of responsibilities between commuters, PTOs and the Government, in order to achieve quality service, affordable fares and a viable and sustainable system.",9,17,012-001-090-003-005-017,50
2013-02-05,Impact of Public Transport Fare Increases on Transport Workers' Salaries,012-001-090-003-005,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The key to achieving this balance is to have a robust regulatory framework. Our regulatory framework requires the PTOs to comply with prescribed service standards and maintenance requirements, failing which penalties will be imposed. This helps to safeguard commuter interest through requiring the PTOs to invest sufficiently to meet these standards. For example, when LTA completes its regulatory review in a few months' time to further tighten rail service standards, the PTOs will need to invest more to deliver the higher levels of service and reliability required of them.",10,18,012-001-090-003-005-018,51
2013-02-05,Impact of Public Transport Fare Increases on Transport Workers' Salaries,012-001-090-003-005,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"However, beyond just imposing the more stringent regulatory standards and heftier fines, LTA is taking a deeper look at the engineering and maintenance systems and processes that rail operators have put in place. This is an added safeguard following the Committee of Inquiry's report. Let me assure Mr Baey that we are mindful of the concern that he has raised, that the rail operator might get distracted from its primary mission, or for that matter, simply focus on short-term profitability while scrimping on maintenance.",11,19,012-001-090-003-005-019,52

2013-02-05,Impact of Public Transport Fare Increases on Transport Workers' Salaries,012-001-090-003-005,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,Public transport fares have been adjusted in small amounts seven times over the last 10 years from 2003 to 2012. That is the period that I am looking at - seven times over the past 10 years by the Public Transport Council (PTC). There was also an occasion in 2009 where the PTC reduced fares because of adverse economic conditions despite the fare formula yielding a fare increase.,13,21,012-001-090-003-005-021,54
2013-02-05,Impact of Public Transport Fare Increases on Transport Workers' Salaries,012-001-090-003-005,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"From 2006 to 2011, fares increased cumulatively by 0.3%. Diesel prices for that same period went up by about 55% and national wages by over 25% for this same period from 2006 to 2011. This has caused a significant shortfall between fare increases and operating cost increases, and put downward pressure on wages for public transport employees. While the PTOs have increased bus driver salaries recently, against the backdrop of worsening bus industry financials, I expect that going forward, it will be a challenge for the PTOs to do more without fare increases or some form of Government subsidy.",14,22,012-001-090-003-005-022,55
2013-02-05,Impact of Public Transport Fare Increases on Transport Workers' Salaries,012-001-090-003-005,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"On whether bus and train driver salaries should be included as an explicit component in the fare formula, this is an issue for the Fare Review Mechanism Committee, chaired by Mr Richard Magnus, to consider. I know that the FRMC is very focussed on making sure that whatever fare formula is proposed, there is assurance that we safeguard commuter interest in affordable public transport fares.

2013-02-05,Impact of Public Transport Fare Increases on Transport Workers' Salaries,012-001-090-003-005,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The bottom line is this  the Government is fully committed to keeping public transport fares affordable.

This certainly will be a priority for us moving forward.",2,26,012-001-090-003-005-026,59
2013-02-05,Impact of Public Transport Fare Increases on Transport Workers' Salaries,012-001-090-003-005,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"  Madam, I understand the Ministry ensures the service quality of PTOs based on the performance standard as well as penalties meted out when they do not meet those standards. I would like to ask the Minister how does MOT ensure that the money that is being used to pay for penalties is not drawn from commuter fare revenue but from the profits of non-transport operations and hence shareholders' dividends?",1,27,012-001-090-003-005-027,60
2013-02-05,Impact of Public Transport Fare Increases on Transport Workers' Salaries,012-001-090-003-005,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"My second question is that given that the public transport operations receive Government grant injection and hence are not as lucrative as commercial operations such as retail malls, would a situation arise that the PTO becomes more motivated and interested to make more profits from non-transport operations and does not mind paying for the penalties for service lapses because it just makes economic sense for them as a listed company. So, how does MOT ensure that this situation does not happen?",2,28,012-001-090-003-005-028,61
2013-02-05,Impact of Public Transport Fare Increases on Transport Workers' Salaries,012-001-090-003-005,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"  Madam, let me thank the Member for his two supplementary questions. On fines, first, the fines are put into the Public Transport Fund and that is used to issue vouchers that we provide to the more needy residents. Secondly, when the Public Transport Council looks at fare increases, they take into account what the fare formula recommends as well as what the financial performance of the operators are, for example, looking at the ROTA and the trend of the ROTA. There is no component in the fare formula that looks at the fines that they have paid to the regulator. So, that is not taken into consideration in any fare increase.",1,29,012-001-090-003-005-029,62
2013-02-05,Impact of Public Transport Fare Increases on Transport Workers' Salaries,012-001-090-003-005,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The situation that the Member mentioned where PTOs pay more attention than they ought to their commercial operations, it is something that we must safeguard ourselves against. Hence not only must we set very high performance standards and hold them to account for this, fine them when necessary, but LTA is also now more closely involved in their processes – operations as well as in maintenance to make sure that throughout the organisation from the top down, they pay sufficient attention to these areas which are of greatest concern to us.",2,30,012-001-090-003-005-030,63

2013-02-05,Impact of Public Transport Fare Increases on Transport Workers' Salaries,012-001-090-003-005,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"  Mdm Speaker, let me thank the Member for her usual penetrating questions. First on profitability  in the past, they looked at ROTA and used that as a gauge. Therefore indeed there were years when, for example, they would give a fare increase to the buses but not to the rail. This was before we had distance fares. The actual mechanics going forward -- this is something that we can ask FRMC, the Fare Review Mechanism Committee chaired by Mr Richard Magnus, to take a closer look at. Indeed they are doing so on concessions for the different groups including students, polytechnics as well as others.",1,32,012-001-090-003-005-032,65
2013-02-05,Impact of Public Transport Fare Increases on Transport Workers' Salaries,012-001-090-003-005,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"On the Member's third question which is how much SMRT has to pay for the assets, let me read carefully what I said here. I said that SMRT will need to invest in more trains for the North-South East-West Lines, the Circle Line and the Bukit Panjang LRT. They will also have to pay for the re-signalling project for the North-South East-West Lines. That amount is about $750 million. So that is the first component that the Member asked about.",2,33,012-001-090-003-005-033,66
2013-02-05,Impact of Public Transport Fare Increases on Transport Workers' Salaries,012-001-090-003-005,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"The second component is that they will have to buy over from the Government the first set of operating assets of the Circle Line in 2019.That is the second component. They buy over at Net Book Value because there is a certain depreciation of those assets from when it was purchased initially, and operated over the years, there is a certain depreciation. Our estimate is that come 2019, they will have to pay about $1 billion to buy over those assets.",3,34,012-001-090-003-005-034,67

May I ask the Minister whether he agrees with me that public transport is an essential service that may affect the lives of many Singaporeans and the state of our country's economy? Therefore is it not better to move away from the profit-oriented business model that is answerable to the shareholders' interest which may further add on to the cost of our public transport services?",1,36,012-001-090-003-005-036,69

On whether we consider public transport an essential service, certainly we do. The question is whether we should move away from the profit-oriented model. I think the difficulty really is whether we can move to something that is as efficient and as cost conscious as what it is today. I think that is indeed the challenge.",1,39,012-001-090-003-005-039,72
2013-02-05,Impact of Public Transport Fare Increases on Transport Workers' Salaries,012-001-090-003-005,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"When we look at what other cities have done. Those that are operating nationalised models, we find actually that – at least in the examples I have given you – the fares are higher and on top of that, there are subsidies that are provided by the government. It is quite a heavy burden on the state and ultimately on the taxpayers. The question we have to ask ourselves is that if I can find something that is alternate to what we have today, that can run just as efficiently or even better, I would really like to consider that. What we have seen in a number of cities actually is that they have moved away from a nationalised model to a privatised model. In some cities, like in Australia, when they run bus services, part of which is provided by a nationalised entity, and part of which they have privatised, they have told us that actually there is a benefit, a more efficient way and hence lower cost when the private companies take over the running of such services.",2,40,012-001-090-003-005-040,73
2013-02-05,Impact of Public Transport Fare Increases on Transport Workers' Salaries,012-001-090-003-005,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"On targeted subventions, the Member has raised a good point. Indeed today, there are concessions that we provide to the elderly so they have a full-day concession for travel on the transport system. There are some concessions given to students and so on. The question is whether we should do more, how much more, and how that ought to be funded by other transport users, or it ought to be something that is borne by the Government. And that something is obviously something that can be discussed and debated further.",3,41,012-001-090-003-005-041,74
2013-02-05,Impact of Public Transport Fare Increases on Transport Workers' Salaries,012-001-090-003-005,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The third is a very good question because really we want to make sure that the operators pay enough attention not just only to the immediate maintenance problems but also making sure that they do a sufficient amount for the long-term sustainability of the transport system. So, when we look at what they do and we ask for their plans, we also look at whether they are planning for upgrades, mid-life upgrades, end-of-life upgrades to the trains and so on. Infrastructure, for example, now the third rail, the claws, that is something that we are also paying much more attention to than in the past. In the past, it used to be that we hold them accountable to the OPS performance standards. Now we not only do that and have tightened that, but we also go down more to look at their processes and their maintenance plans.",4,42,012-001-090-003-005-042,75

Minister, when we look at the figures, they are very assuring because Singapore runs the cheapest average fare for bus and rail journey over 10 km, compared to four other metropolises, and considerably lower than Hong Kong and Tokyo.

Firstly, I gave the FRMC quite a clean slate. Not only do they deliver a new formula but they are also going to take into consideration quite a number of different other areas. Ultimately, when there is a fare adjustment, it is actually the PTC – the Public Transport Council – that decides on the amount. Whether to follow the fare formula rigidly or whether to deviate from the fare formula. If we look at our recent examples from 2006, certainly the PTC has deviated from the fare formula because the accumulative adjustment was 0.3% over those five years. I believe the fare formula would have recommended a lot more.",1,57,012-001-090-003-005-057,90

And I think it is therefore the responsibility of the regulator to make sure that if this is so, we re-orientate the company. I make sure that I have regular meetings with the Chairman and the senior management. I make known my expectations of how I expect public transport service to be provided and the quality and reliability that I expect to see. From time to time, we will have to sit down and talk to them about operational matters and also to make sure that, if necessary, we properly align for the long term.",3,59,012-001-090-003-005-059,92

As I said when I first came in 2011, these were all on my radar screen but I was more sympathetic to additional concessions for the elderly. That was my first priority, and in the 2011 fare adjustment, we did manage to do something to that and extend their concessions to the entire day. If and when a fare adjustment takes place or to be decided − because there really is not even a new formula on the table yet and we will have to go through the process of talking about it when the formula is eventually reviewed – certainly Members can be sure that this and a few other areas, including for the disabled, are very much on my radar horizon as well.",4,60,012-001-090-003-005-060,93

2013-02-05,Preventing Runaway COE Prices,012-001-090-003-006,Mrs Josephine Teo,"  Madam, given the limited supply of COEs and our bidding system for COEs, prices would be determined largely by demand.

Businesses bid for COEs for commercial vehicles in a separate Category C, and do not have to compete with private car buyers in Categories A and B. In addition, the Additional Registration Fee (ARF) for most goods vehicles is set at 5% of the vehicle's Open Market Value (OMV), instead of the 100% OMV applicable to cars.",2,6,012-001-090-003-006-006,99

While the suggestions are well-intentioned, it would be important for us to look at them closely, to consider if they can really be effective in promoting lower prices or greater stability in the COE market, without distorting the market inappropriately. I would also add that left to its own, the market has seen in the past, instances of COE prices going down, sometimes sharply. This happened in around 2009, likely due to the weak economy. So, in conclusion, buyers do make a conscious decision not to rush in during periods when the market is particularly exuberant.

I think what Dr Lim is referring to is that there was a time where the prices of COEs between Category A and Category B were quite different. So, it was quite different in the past, and I hope that I can explain that a little bit further. But, over time, that gap has closed. So whether it is Category A or Category B, that gap has closed. One of the reasons why this has happened, as has been pointed out by many observers, is that increasingly you will find premium makes also in Category A. For example, in Category A you might find a Mercedes A class. And so there is a perception that there is some activity going on that is causing the premium makes to also push out cars. This is something actually very worth studying. One contributing factor is that worldwide, for environmental reasons, even premium makes are pushing out cars of smaller engine capacity. And this might have contributed to a closing of the gap between the Category A COE prices and the Category B COE prices.",1,11,012-001-090-003-006-011,104

Precisely for the reasons that he articulated, the number of COEs that are recycled back after they are de-registered has been adjusted. It used to be that for de-registered COEs, 25% of them went to Category E. And precisely for the reasons that was cited by Mr Ang, we have reduced that percentage and now 15% goes into Category E, while the rest goes back to the categories from which the cars were originally registered.

2013-02-05,Preventing Runaway COE Prices,012-001-090-003-006,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In quick summary, Madam, it has to do with two things. The first is that it is hard for us to say definitively why a person who is buying a car for a second time is always less deserving than one buying it for the first time. I cited the examples of families which have grown in size because they have had more children or elderly members have moved in. There could also be businesses which are growing very well and they need that additional vehicle to service their expanding customer base.",2,20,012-001-090-003-006-020,113
2013-02-05,Preventing Runaway COE Prices,012-001-090-003-006,Mrs Josephine Teo,"One difficulty is with how we can say definitively certain care buyers need a car more than other groups of car buyers. The second difficulty relates to the fact that this is a policy that will be quite easy to circumvent. Today, if a family was forced to register a car, in the name of first-time car owner, it would be quite easy for him to ask a relative to stand in and be registered as the first-time car owner. Similarly, a business could set up a subsidiary to own just a car. So there is a practical difficulty with implementing policy of this nature. So, that is something we have to bear in mind, whether it can be effectively implemented, otherwise, we would be doing something that gives the impression of helping first-time car buyers when, in fact, it does not really.

We have an average GDP per capita of over US$60,000 which is excellent but a median income per adult of only about US$30,000, which is very low.

I hope that this House and the members of the public will agree with us that, actually, going forward, our help needs to be much more targeted. We need to give more help to those people at the bottom and perhaps, not so much to those people at the top end. So it will not be a case whereby everything is universal, but we really should focus more help to those people at the bottom.

Whether we should have a defined criterion of one year prior or two years prior, as I mentioned earlier, we would prefer not to have measures that are retrospectively applied. I am sure that if we had heeded the call of the Member and applied the effective date to one year prior to the announcement in January, those who have just missed the deadline would also say that it is unfair to them.

Whenever we improve or change our policies and incentives, unfortunately, some people may feel that they have not been able to take advantage of the new enhancements, but this is how things work. It is not possible for us to back-date all future announcements and make the commitment to apply benefits to all cases retrospectively.

It seeks to enable Singaporeans to continue to live in a harmonious society, with strong supportive families, good jobs and a good quality of life. By any account, the Paper's assumption of GDP growth of 3% to 5% up to 2020, falling to 2% to 3% in the next decade, is less than half of the 5.6% average annual growth in the 2000s' and the 7% growth in the two decades prior. Partly, the reduced GDP numbers recognise that with a higher base today, and as we mature further, our economy cannot grow at the elevated levels we had enjoyed previously. Equally important, it also highlights that the premise of the White Paper is not a ""growth at all costs"" strategy. That growth, and the increase in foreign workforce accompanying that growth, must be socially sustainable.",7,10,012-001-090-003-013-010,182

They assume similar productivity growth assumptions of 2% to 3% per annum this decade and 1% to 2% per annum next decade. But – and this seems to be the key plank of their programme -- they propose to grow the resident workforce by at least 1% per annum by encouraging older workers, foreign spouses and economically inactive women to join the workforce. With this, they project that the population in 2030 will be 5.9 million, or one million less than the 6.9 million figure in the Paper.",8,11,012-001-090-003-013-011,183

And will continue to strengthen these schemes. The employment of older workers aged 65 to 69 years, for instance, at 36.9% as at 2012, is one of the highest in the world and behind only South Korea and Japan. In fact, our assumptions for the resident workforce's percentage point contribution to total workforce growth, which is at 0.7% for the rest of this decade, have already taken into account that more older workers, women, etc, will continue to work or return to work.

Based on our estimates, our resident workforce's contribution to total labour force growth could reach 0.7% per annum up to 2020, whilst the Workers' Party proposes to grow this by at least 1% per annum, and yet only have 0.5% total workforce growth from now till 2030.",14,17,012-001-090-003-013-017,189

They have collectively expressed horror over the White Paper's projected slowdown in workforce growth to about 1% to 2% in this decade and then to 1% in the next decade. Many companies, especially SMEs, are reportedly scrapping expansion plans or thinking of moving out their plants. They are understandably worried that further foreign manpower restrictions will cripple their businesses. Whilst raising productivity through innovation, technology and process improvement can help reduce their dependence on labour, there is also a limit as to how far this can go. Already, the productivity targets of 2% to 3% per annum till 2020, and then 1% to 2% after 2020 to 2030 are stretched targets.",16,19,012-001-090-003-013-019,191

Under this scenario, many companies are likely to fold or move out of Singapore whilst others will not be attracted to set up shop here, resulting in fewer jobs for Singaporeans. Hence, to curb immigration or foreign workforce growth with such a proposal in order to help safeguard Singaporeans could, in an ironic twist, hurt the very people this reversal is intended to help.",18,21,012-001-090-003-013-021,193

Many new citizens continue to make good contributions to Singapore. Hence, all citizens should be treated equally and with respect, as they have made the conscious decision to take up the pink identity card and forge a common future with us here. It is unhelpful and unfair to distinguish between local-born Singaporeans - or, as the hon.

It will increase the cost of the package from $1.6 billion to $2 billion a year. The enhanced package includes measures which signal paradigm shifts, such as paternity leave and Medishield for newly-diagnosed congenital and neonatal conditions. Hence, far from being half-hearted in promoting Marriage and Parenthood, as the Hon Members Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Faishal Manap have claimed, I would say that the Government has put much effort and heart to promote Marriage and Parenthood.",27,30,012-001-090-003-013-030,202

Member Ms Sylvia Lim brought up the example of South Korea as a country that has successfully reversed their falling TFR from 1.08 in 2005 to 1.23 in 2010. She highlighted some measures adopted by the Korean government which could have contributed to their success, such as institutional support for family life and promoting gender equality within the family. I thank her for highlighting this example but I would like to note that the NPTD, in crafting the Marriage and Parenthood Package, has, in fact, looked quite exhaustively at the policies of many countries, including South Korea, and will continue to monitor them. Whilst it is commendable that South Korea has managed to raise its TFR to 1.23 in 2010 and, in fact, 1.24 in 2011, this is still far below the replacement rate, and not much higher than that of Singapore's 1.2 in 2011. In fact, I understand that the preliminary estimate of the TFR for 2012 in Korea is 1.23. This compares to our estimate of between 1.28 and 1.3 for 2012, due to the dragon year effect. Moreover, while Singapore is a city-state, South Korea is a large country, and one would expect that the TFR within a major city like Seoul could well be lower.",28,31,012-001-090-003-013-031,203

Will we Singaporeans be strangers in our own land? Will this irrevocably change the character of our society and dilute our national identity, as the WP has also argued? Will we eventually become like the Middle East oil states where locals constitute only 10% of the entire population and the rest are contract workers, with all the attendant social problems this might bring? This is a legitimate concern, but somewhat misplaced, because, as noted by Deputy Prime Minister Teo, the 6.5 million to 6.9 million population figures are estimates with the 6.9 million as the worse case scenario necessary for planning purposes.",30,33,012-001-090-003-013-033,205

As Deputy Prime Minister Teo noted, if we can ensure the well-being of Singaporeans with a smaller population, whether 6.5 million or lower, there is no reason to go higher.

The first decision is, given the grim ageing demographic, should we have a policy of zero population growth? We are not even talking about negative, I think that is out. But let us say zero population growth. What would happen if we have zero population growth? The truth is come 2020, the number of working citizens will decline because the number of citizens retiring will be more than those entering the workforce. It will have direct contraction effects on the economy. It would also mean a heavier economic load to the smaller base of working citizens who have to support a much bigger base of retired citizens. Inevitably, taxes will need to be raise not just because of the smaller base of tax-paying citizens but also the expected higher social spending for a larger base of retired citizens.",5,43,012-001-090-003-013-043,215

Given our circumstances as a small island state with no natural resources, if we are faced with a prolonged stagnant economy, would we still have the competitive ability to earn the foreign exchange to pay for what we import? Our food, energy, raw materials, basic needs are almost all imported and paid for by the foreign exchange that we earn because of our competitive economy. Consumers of the world do not owe us a living and we have to earn our keeps. So, it is also about economic security.",6,44,012-001-090-003-013-044,216

At that population growth, our projected total workforce growth would be between 1% and 2% from now till 2020 and 1% from 2020 onwards; a rate of growth that worries the businesses a great deal.

We need to help our citizens better maximise our so-called ""home ground advantage"" and benefit from the job opportunities available and get higher salaries. What would work against the strengthening of Singaporean core is where foreigners are seen to be taking up jobs that Singaporeans can do.

In a downturn or an economic slowdown, we can always tighten the work permits and Employment Passes to trim down the foreign workforce. It has happened during the downturn in 2001 and 2009 where foreign labour was significantly reduced then. I am sure the Government will again use this tool in similar circumstances so that citizen unemployment will be kept to the minimal. There is no point keeping the foreigners here if there are no jobs and also no jobs for Singaporeans. So, that would be a good buffer for us.",17,55,012-001-090-003-013-055,227

Bearing in mind, come 2020, we will have at least 16,000 Singaporeans per year graduating from local universities and many others from the polytechnics and ITEs. We need to keep creating good employment, good jobs, for these graduates every year. No mean feat.

I think that is important. Even at the upper end of the population limit, our population density is still lower than many of the cities in the world. However, like Members before me, I am more concerned about the high proportion of foreigners relative to citizens residing in this island come 2030.

And we still have time to prevent this from happening. Besides, stronger incentives to improve citizen fertility rate and increase productivity to reduce dependence on foreign workers, we should test-bed new business ideas, models and technology where foreigners can work for us and yet remain in their home country, for example, by way of off-shoring. Given our domestic constraints and our small domestic markets, we need even more local bred companies who are deeply rooted in Singapore but yet derive more of their revenue from overseas through their regionalisation efforts.

The housing imbalances of the last three to four years have caused lots of angst to would-be home buyers. High COVs, long waiting time for BTOs and the fear of being caught behind the curve as the property prices rises are real problems and what many Singaporeans live through. Lack of affordable eateries has led to higher stall rentals and as a result higher food prices.",29,67,012-001-090-003-013-067,239

It requires the resolve, cutting the red tape and, of course, the resources and the necessary funding.",30,68,012-001-090-003-013-068,240
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-013,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Panjang),"The Government needs to act decisively and swiftly; particularly in the area of transport. We need to speed up the bus capacity enhancement programme. Buses are still very crowded during the peak hours and chaotic scenes at bus stops are daily occurrences. Feeder services are inadequate and prolong the overall commuting time. While there are new MRT lines being constructed and planned, it will take many more years before they are ready. In the interim years, we need a major step-up in the provision of buses. The first round implementation of BSEP, while it is good, hardly moves the needle too much and we need a stronger dose to see real meaningful improvements. If need be, the Government must be prepared to upsize the $1.1 billion BSEP if it is inadequate. If the current two public transport operators are incapable of increasing the bus fleets fast enough, we should look to other private operators to do the job.",31,69,012-001-090-003-013-069,241
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-013,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Panjang),"In 2010, I remember seeing how the Resort World Singapore was able to step up their free shuttle bus services from the heartlands to the IR all in a matter of few months; with their services running as late as 2.30 am. In fact, they were looking to expand their free shuttle bus services to more HDB towns until I raise this concern in Parliament and then the service was halted. Why is it that the IR operator could have built up such an extensive bus service network so fast while our two experienced public transport operators are unable to cope and deliver? I am glad I pushed for the stoppage then as it not only makes it less convenient for heartlanders to gamble at the casino but it also frees up bus drivers that would otherwise be driving for the IR operator. If the existing two PTOs do not have the bandwidth to expand bus service capacity under BSEP, we should look to other private operators to do the job.",32,70,012-001-090-003-013-070,242
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-013,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Panjang),"We also need to urgently solve the road transport bottlenecks. One of the frustrations when dealing with agencies like LTA and HDB is that they seem to have their plates full and they have limited bandwidth left to attend and resolve the local bottleneck issues. Even if a solution has been identified, I get the sense that they are either having problems getting the necessary funding or the funding will take a long while to come. These have to change if we are serious about building a high quality living environment for a growing population.",33,71,012-001-090-003-013-071,243

In all fairness, they are all overwhelmed by the numerous requests, piling up from different quarters all over the island. At the same time, they also have their mega projects to oversee. So, clearly, the frontline agencies like LTA and HDB need to be given more resources and more funding if they are to quickly solve our current bottlenecks and ease the strains. In particular, greater approving authority be delegated to lower levels so as to speed up the implementation of improvement projects and more resources and funding are set aside to specifically solve local infrastructure problems.",34,72,012-001-090-003-013-072,244

I am glad the Government has resumed building hawker centres but the timeline to build 10 hawker centres in 10 years are far from aggressive and not aspiring enough. Hawker centres serve many purposes and, among others, help keep cost of living low. Given the expected population build up, I would urge the Government to really build more and build faster. Instead of 10 hawker centres in 10 years, we should be looking at building 20 hawker centres in five years.

The biggest of these, of course, is the planning parameter of raising our population to 6.9 million, with 55% of these being Singaporeans. If this scenario comes to pass, and I say again, if this scenario comes to pass, we are talking about adding about 100,000 residents every year, until 2030. Hundred thousand more residents mean that much more demand for housing, transport, medical services, and other strains on our infrastructure. Given the experiences of Singaporeans following recent increases in our population, of overcrowding in our public transport and other public amenities, I was not surprised that many voiced concern, and some even voiced disbelief, over a larger population.",2,96,012-001-090-003-013-096,268
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-013,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"But I believe the Government is doing the right thing by making these planning parameters public as early as possible, so that Singaporeans can give their feedback, and be co-authors of what they want future Singapore to be, for them and for their children. I believe it would be worthwhile for the Government to take greater steps to explain the difference between planning parameters and specific targets or goals, so that Singaporeans can understand that plans are for discussion, and nothing is a foregone conclusion because we know nobody knows what is going to happen in the future.",3,97,012-001-090-003-013-097,269
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-013,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Mdm Speaker, I would like to touch on three areas that my residents are concerned about. First, even as we plan to grow our population, and to ensure that majority of Singaporeans would hold white collar jobs as predicted in the future, we must assure ourselves that Singaporeans will have the opportunities to be the core workforce in every industry, and in every company. While we appreciate foreign investment, and the technical and managerial expertise this brings, we must strive to ensure that in addition to white collar work, Singaporeans must be allowed to, over time, systematically take over core technical and management functions previously held by foreigners. The Government could put into place requirements to not only transfer technical knowledge, but also administrative and managerial functions, personal networks and other soft skills, so that even foreign companies in Singapore can be run by highly qualified and competent Singaporeans. With Singaporeans holding more senior positions, we would be able to see a narrowing of income gaps between high-income foreigners and locals, which is one stress point that makes foreigners less welcome here that we often hear about.",4,98,012-001-090-003-013-098,270
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-013,Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Secondly, in order for this to happen, we must ask ourselves whether our education and training system is producing the right type of talent for the future. There is no doubt that our local institutions are ranked very highly for their academic quality, but we must be equally assured that we are equipping our future workforce with not only the right knowledge and skills, but also the right attitudes and worldviews to take on these higher level roles. Are we confident that our education system is forward looking enough to anticipate what knowledge and skills will be needed in 2030? It is really a challenging proposition. Let me just give an example. Someone who is 10 years old today, and in primary school, will probably be a new worker in 2030 at the age 27.",5,99,012-001-090-003-013-099,271

So, we will have to look into the future to account for the needs of the economy and reverse engineer education programmes for our young and for our current workforce. And if we are to expect our 40- year-olds to be relevant in the future, we will also have to train and have re-education programmes, so that he is not redundant in the future Singapore. It would be worthwhile to take a hard look at our education and training systems to see if they allow enough flexibility to take into account individual preferences, and yet are sufficiently geared towards the needs of the economy.",6,100,012-001-090-003-013-100,272

Many are concerned about their low skills, and yet may not have the wherewithal to upgrade – for many of these reasons. So, even as we plan and prepare for the future, we must take care of the present, and assuage the fears of many ordinary Singaporeans who are concerned about their livelihoods today.",7,101,012-001-090-003-013-101,273

I believe it has become amply clear that an incremental or linear approach to policies can no longer work. So, we cannot simply say that an increase in our population, let us say, for example, by 30% requires an increase in accompanying infrastructure, for example, MRT lines, by 30%. It is clear now that in this Paper our policy makers are beginning to challenge themselves to make quantum improvements in their policy responses, and put Singaporeans at the core of every policy decision. Having good policies alone is not sufficient. It is important to be able to explain these policies and their assumptions, and the attendant constraints to the public, and to leave sufficient room for good suggestions to be incorporated. No longer does wisdom lie solely among our policy makers, but it also lies amongst Singaporeans, who are well-educated, who have travelled widely, and who have excellent suggestions, and these can also help to shape our policies in the future. And not least, we must make every effort to hear from the common man, who would feel the brunt of our policies, and ask them whether their lives are improved or made worse by our policies.",8,102,012-001-090-003-013-102,274

Optimism because many can see the potential dynamic and vibrant Singapore with spanking facilities for Singaporeans, where residents can fulfil their hopes and aspirations, and achieve a better standard of living but, at the same time, they have concerns because some of my residents are asking whether is there enough space and also room for them in the future Singapore. These are residents from all walks of lives who are from low-skilled and low-income families to the high-income earning professionals. They are concerned and these are real concerns. Let us work together because these legitimate concerns need to be addressed and the Government would be well advised to pay attention to these in its policy formulation.

Although everyone has attributed this to the tightening in the foreign worker policy, and that the younger generation of Singaporeans do not wish to work in the services sector, I feel that the difficulties of hiring staff for the food & beverage industry had begun even before this. When the Government was intent on promoting the tourism industry, and allowed two integrated resorts to be set up in Singapore, the two large investors both expressed being able to individually provide 10,000 employment opportunities for local Singaporeans, making a total of more than 20,000 jobs. As this happened during the financial tsunami, this news brought great relief to all. It was a rosy picture as it attracted foreign investment, created employment opportunities, and brought in tourist revenue. Looking back, there is only a limited supply amongst the local population which can be absorbed into the services sector.

However, we should realise that not all Singaporeans are able to excel in the MNC playing field. Thus, although local enterprises cannot match up to MNCs in productivity or economic contribution, they still form the core of the Singapore business community. Even if their pace of growth is slower than that of the MNCs, they are still Singaporean enterprises which help to create employment opportunities for Singaporeans and provide services for the MNCs.",11,132,012-001-090-003-013-132,304

By 2030, two out of every three Singaporeans would be professionals, managers, executives and technical workers. As I view this idyllic blueprint, I also begin to worry. If our local enterprises cannot provide enough PMET jobs, do the white-collar jobs that require two out of three Singaporeans need to fall back on foreign investors to provide?

However, while one ministry had been increasing the number of immigrants into Singapore, the other ministries in charge of transport, housing and other areas had not kept pace, and created the problems of over-congestion in the infrastructure. Clearly, the just-released White Paper on Population has shown that within a short period of eight years since 2005, the population has increased by 1.1 million, and lowered the percentage of Singapore citizens to the current 62 per cent. This percentage is likely to continue to plummet. This accelerated growth of immigrants and the problems of cultural assimilation has created social conflicts.

While Singapore is still an immigrant society, we must still maintain a Singaporean core in the population. Those Singaporeans who live here for more than two generations should not only be the largest ratio, but has to make up a significant core that has influence over the immigrant population. There are many grouses on the increasing numbers of foreigners. However, when social cohesion is facing such conflicts, should we not move beyond the complaint mode and move quickly into action, forming families, getting married and having children, so that to ensure that the Singaporean core of the population does not get eroded because of the ageing population?",18,139,012-001-090-003-013-139,311

This root has also exacerbated the predicament of manpower shortage in the business community, and the Government has no choice but to bring in foreign workers. Following the Marriage and Parenthood incentives rolled out by the Government, I urge all young Singaporeans to respond by having more children. If the Singapore birth rate can increase, it would put less pressure on the problems created by the ageing population, and social problems would also decrease.

First  The workforce growth of between 1-2% cannot be further reduced, otherwise enterprises cannot survive. Second  Singapore is at the heart of Asia, a region of rapid growth. The White Paper projects that Singapore's GDP growth will likely be between 2-3% per year from 2020-2030, and this is also a target that businesses should aim to achieve, however challenging it may be. If we are unable to meet these targets, Singapore will lose its attractiveness to investors, local enterprises will lose their competitiveness, and the Singapore economy would be badly affected. Three  in order to solve the manpower shortage, businesses are already trying their best to utilise the latent manpower pool, recruiting older workers and getting housewives to re-enter the workforce, but the reality is due to limitations of age and physical strength, they would not be able to take on certain jobs.",20,141,012-001-090-003-013-141,313

Singapore is a small country and citizens are still facing real issues on affordability and accessibility. Crowded trains and buses, high property prices, competition at the workplace, cost of living are some issues confronting Singaporeans today.

Whilst I want to be optimistic, the current social trends and norms make me doubtful. The global fertility rate makes it unclear the latest package of benefits will bear fruits to achieve an acceptable level of birth rates.

Lower birth rate is not a phenomenon that affects Singapore alone as many other Western and Asian countries are confronted with similar problems.

2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-013,Mr Chen Show Mao,"For the Workers' Party, a dynamic Singaporean population is a very populous and meaning of our existence as a nation and economy and existence that should be sustainable. We believe that any labour force growth should take place via a targeted 1% per annum growth in the resident labour force. Over the longer term, we should target to increase the existing labour force participation rate currently at 66.6%, instead of immediately turning towards importing new workers. Over the short term, our resident labour force grows when young citizens or permanent residents enter the labour force. We can target different groups about our existing population that are currently economically inactive and focus on removing the barriers that may be keeping them from entering or even re-entering the labour force. These include resident foreign spouses, stay-at-home parents and also the elderly.",16,187,012-001-090-003-013-187,359
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-013,Mr Chen Show Mao,"At present, resident foreign spouses who are on Long-Term Visit Passes or Dependant's Passes are not eligible to take up employment. If they want to do so, they need to apply for work passes and be subject to the qualification criteria and are tied to a specific job. Those on the new Long-Term Visit Pass-Plus (LTVP+) Scheme do not need to apply for work passes, just a letter of consent for a specific job. These requirements may make it difficult for these pass holders to enter the workforce and indeed an average of 19.5% of work pass applications by these foreign spouses on LTVP+ were unsuccessful. It could be even more difficult for them to meet the requirements if they are hoping to work part-time or on a flexible schedule because they have other responsibilities at home.",17,188,012-001-090-003-013-188,360
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-013,Mr Chen Show Mao,"As for stay-at-home parents, encouraging them to re-enter the workforce can be in the form of, as many has pointed out, introducing better, more affordable and convenient childcare support. Perhaps in conjunction with incentives to employers to have such facilities in the workplace and, as some had mentioned, also in terms of making flexible working arrangements more available. If we look at some of the OECD economies with high TFR, some of them have higher TFR and female labour force participation rates than us. Clearly, more can be done and the public sector should lead the way. While current Government programmes include initiatives aimed at providing incentives to get economically inactive Singaporeans into the workforce, more can be done. Perhaps, structural changes are needed in our workforce and family-friendly support structures in order to allow a greater proportion beyond the 35% of employers who were offering at least one form of work-life arrangements in 2010.",18,189,012-001-090-003-013-189,361
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-013,Mr Chen Show Mao,"The last group is the elderly. The Government has been trying to get more elderly people to remain in the workforce for a longer period. Indeed the employment rate for older workers aged 55 to 64 has increased in recent years. But as we pointed out before in Parliament, these numbers may not tell the story of unemployment. Studies have shown that older Singaporeans are also healthier. We believe that our elderly should be able to work for as long as they want to and are able to, and there is scope for older workers to help grow the resident workforce. The male labour force participation rate for those aged 60 to 64 was 74.6% and 52.6% for those aged 65 to 69. For women, the figures in 2012 were 41.7% and 26.3%. We have age discrimination in hiring and in the workplace which is a common concern of many Singaporeans.",19,190,012-001-090-003-013-190,362
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-013,Mr Chen Show Mao,"The Singapore Workforce Report mentioned employers' discrimination, preference for young workers as a major reason why discouraged workers have given up their search for jobs. We should actively investigate if additional administrative or even legislative measures could be taken to remove this impediment through our older workers re-entering or stay in the labour force. In addition, incentives for businesses not only to hire older workers but to redesign jobs, processes and also workplace specifically for older workers should play a larger role in our measures to improve productivity. More targeted measures can be done to help older workers remain as productive as their younger counterparts. When older workers are able to be more productive, employers will be more inclined to retain or hire them. We have been shown charts for growing old age dependency ratio which is the ratio of persons aged 20 to 64 years to persons aged 65 and over. When we look at that, we should also bear in mind that with improvements in health and life expectancy, many of our elders, as many had pointed out, are healthy and able to work longer and indeed they want to, not to mention that many have economic resources of their own, they are not all economically dependent.",20,191,012-001-090-003-013-191,363
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-013,Mr Chen Show Mao,"Madam, an ageing population is a triumph of development. We should stop seeing elderly Singaporeans as a drain on our economy and a hindrance to our growth to keep Singapore dynamic. Older Singaporeans have much to offer us and not all of it can be measured in economic terms. In fact, our elderly Singaporeans are essential to maintaining a Singapore core. Older Singaporeans are custodians of culture and, as some had suggested, can be employed in schools to teach subjects such as social studies in National Education or be encouraged to volunteer to do so. This is also a way of encouraging cross-generational sharing and learning, particularly in a society where family trends are shifting and there may be less opportunities for inter-generational sharing within the family.",21,192,012-001-090-003-013-192,364

Young people would leave for more exciting and growing global cities. We need to ask ourselves the reasons why Singaporeans are leaving. Are they leaving because they feel Singapore does not offer them the right economic opportunities that they would need to support their ageing parents and other elders if they stayed. While many of them leaving because they feel that Singapore is becoming overly crowded, costly, competitive and that they would like to live somewhere and bring their children up in a place with more space and greater well-being.",22,193,012-001-090-003-013-193,365

First point of clarification, the 6.9 million number is not a target. We have spelt out the boundaries in terms of potential population growth. We are looking at 6.5 to 6.9. The objective -- and we totally agree with the Workers' Party -- is about the people. It is about the quality of life that can be provided at that stage, not just material but non-material. What are the stepping stones to get there? The economy, the state of economy, the level of population growth is needed and so on.",1,202,012-001-090-003-013-202,374

Mr Chen went on at length with a lot of things about our elderly which actually I have spoken about. And I totally concur. I think we can age well. I think we should look at encouraging women to come back to the workforce, the economically inactives, older workers who contribute in many meaningful ways. I have said that very often.

We have the ADVANTAGE! scheme where we incentivise companies, re-design work arrangements. We have the SEC (Special Employment Credit) which has worked very well. I am not sure if you have read about those initiatives but I am very interested to know the specific programmes you have in mind, obviously because you have been talking about the elderly for a long time.

I know that the outlines of policies will be beneficial in the long run but I am not convinced on the feasibility of the possible population of 6.9 million by 2030. What kind of city-state will it be with our land area of about 700 sq km to be shared by 6.9 million people?

2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-013,Dr Lily Neo (Tanjong Pagar),I feel that we need to make adjustments on our policy-making that caters to the sophistication of today's populace. Better skills on interpersonal nuances that help connect better with the end users are an important tool.

Today, I would like to stress on the road maps we must put in place to cushion the challenges ahead regarding care of the elderly.

2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-013,Dr Lily Neo (Tanjong Pagar),The following are the three areas of my concerns and I would like to suggest solutions for them.,9,224,012-001-090-003-013-224,396
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-013,Dr Lily Neo (Tanjong Pagar),"First, the care of the frail elderly. I feel that it will not be sustainable in the long run to have one-to-one care of a frail elderly, especially one who is homebound with a foreign worker as is the norm of today. The family carers of tomorrow for the frail elderly will be getting fewer in view of the smaller-families trend. Moreover we will need all our young and able individuals to be as economically active as possible in view of our already dwindling working population ratio. But our small land space will be a limiting factor in getting the increasing numbers of foreign workers to care for the growing numbers of frail elderly; the imported foreign carers will thus be a challenge.",10,225,012-001-090-003-013-225,397
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-013,Dr Lily Neo (Tanjong Pagar),"We need to better plan on ways to solve this. I feel that better community living environment is the way to go in order to reduce the reliance on foreign labour. The earlier we start this, the better success we shall have. I have the privilege to be working with many elderly in Chinatown for more than 10 years. I found that active and healthy living in the community with friends, supported by VWOs and grassroots community; keep our elderly happy and healthy. Even when they were struck with severe illnesses, early intervention with care and assistance enabled many to recover quickly to be able to live independently. Thus, facilities to enable healthy community living should be made available. The purpose of such facilities is to enable independent living lifestyles for as long as possible for our elderly. This is also to enable future tapping of resources of the community elderly to care for their buddy frail elderly. This is one good way of self-help and using previously untapped extra resource.",11,226,012-001-090-003-013-226,398
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-013,Dr Lily Neo (Tanjong Pagar),The rendering of assistance on other frail ones will become easier and with more compassion in a community of elderly that have known each other for a longer time. There is also merit to get support from voluntary group organisations and grassroots organisations for such facilities. For a start all studio apartments should have such facilities.,12,227,012-001-090-003-013-227,399

2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-013,Dr Lily Neo (Tanjong Pagar),"Two, the care for the elderly poor. With the growing number of elderly population, and especially with smaller families and fewer children to give the elderly the financial support, the number of the elderly poor will increase in the future. The retirement age has to be further increased so that people can keep their jobs for as long as possible to support themselves. But as in any society, there will always be those that are disadvantaged. These numbers will increase in the future for reasons I mentioned earlier. The Government's coffers may be decreasing with slower economic growth of the future. May I beseech our Government to have safety net policies entrenched to ensure that the needy elderly are taken care of? I would like to suggest the setting up of an elderly needy endowment fund, similar to the Medifund, when our economy is still growing. The Medifund gives the assurance that ""no Singaporean will be deprived of medical care due to the lack of means"" and with the establishment of needy funds, we can add another assurance; ""No Singaporean will be deprived of their daily living due to the lack of means"". I am convinced that Singaporeans will support it and by this provision, it will show that ours is a Government that cares. People can understand and relate to the need for continued growth in Singapore's economy so that we can continue to take better care of the less fortunate citizens.",14,229,012-001-090-003-013-229,401

I am glad we have our 3M-system in place, which is the envy of many countries. The new Community Health Assist Scheme is also another medical subvention scheme especially for the elderly. The recently introduced yearly Medisave top up for our elderly is laudable indeed.

The need for nursing homes, community hospitals and acute hospitals will increase exponentially. Thus, it is necessary to have a good postulation on demand with the possible 6.9 million people and an ageing population. Early planning and proactive measures must be in place.

2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-013,Dr Lily Neo (Tanjong Pagar),"I feel that ideally the care of the elderly will be in assisting them to live as independently and for as long as possible in their own homes with appropriate support as in homecare. It is possible, as in England, to have affordable healthcare workers that can be trained in their specific scope of medical care in a matter of months for homecare. They are trained to do simple homecare such as wound dressing, changing of catheters, nasogastric tubes and so on. This will relieve the total dependence for doctors and nurses for homecare.",18,233,012-001-090-003-013-233,405

This will facilitate independent living for frail elderly and also to facilitate homecare for those who are sick.",19,234,012-001-090-003-013-234,406
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-013,Dr Lily Neo (Tanjong Pagar),"In closing, Madam Speaker, I hope that our Government will continue to give higher consideration for our elderly in future Government subventions. One good example is that instead of blanket subvention for our public transport fares, our Government's subsidy should be given directly for the elderly, such as free public transport for retirees. This will encourage mobility of the elderly to keep them active and healthy. Perhaps then, there will be less clamouring for CBD-housing as the elderly in the CBD can now travel freely to their children's homes island-wide.",20,235,012-001-090-003-013-235,407

Ms Foo spoke on the importance of joint parenting. Our Study showed that 99% of married respondents agreed that fathers and mothers are equally important as caregivers for children. If this is already the case, why the need to emphasise shared responsibility? It is because the majority of the women in Singapore still see raising children as their main responsibility and therefore feel the stresses of balancing work and raising children, especially the education of their children, more so than the fathers. They would be encouraged to have more children if fathers could take on a greater role in raising children.

We have received a fair amount of feedback on the education system and would like to reassure parents that we have heard their feedback, and MOE has started to rebalance our education system. For example, schools have reduced emphasis on examinations in Primary 1 and 2. They are placing a greater emphasis on non-academic programmes like Physical Education, Art and Music. We have introduced diverse educational pathways in our system to cater to those with different areas of strength, and different learning needs. MOE is making changes at a steady pace that is appropriate for the children. We hope that the changes will reduce the competitiveness in the system and refocus our attention in giving our children a holistic education and one that is values-based.

Employers will need to look into how to package these jobs and how to implement flexi-work along with it.

This is crucial for us so as to maintain the costs of living, standards of living and overall well-being for our own Singaporeans. On the other end of the spectrum, there are concerns about foreign PMEs taking away local jobs. Looking at the projected statistics, there will a significant increase in PMET jobs by 2030. 1.25 million Singaporeans will be in PMET jobs compared to 850,000 today. I am glad that the White Paper highlights the need for a Singaporean Core. It is therefore important for us to consider the necessary safeguards that we require to help to put that into action and ensure our local PMEs have job security and fair wages. PMEs and union members I have spoken to are genuinely worried about their jobs and potential PME openings going to foreign PMEs. Till now, we do not have information about the quota set for foreign PMEs or if there is indeed a foreign PME dependency ratio. In previous sittings, I have also called for labour market testing to ensure that Singaporean PMEs will be considered for job vacancies first. I understand that for any employer bent on recruiting foreigners, labour market testing could be just be a window-dressing or a process that they have to go through. As a suggestion, I would like to float the idea of whether there are certain sectors with extremely large number of foreign PMEs, where a foreign PME dependency ratio or labour market testing can be meted out. Perhaps even to come up with a COE system for hiring of foreign PMEs – and I do not mean Certificate of Entitlements. COE means ""Conditions Of Eligibility"" for employers to meet before hiring foreign PMEs, with conditions such as fulfilment of certain critical skills gap, labour market testing and having a Singaporean Core in that particular company.",18,37,012-001-090-003-015-037,508

This is really of no fault of their own as they can be just as committed to the company as any other foreign employee. However, due to global changes and challenges, skills gap and career development by their employers, they can be easily displaced during company restructuring. Sometimes, to their shock, the employers refill the same exact position with a foreign employee. From a career development perspective, there ought to be ready avenues and access to professional upgrades or conversions for them from agencies such as the Workforce Development Agency (WDA). While I am glad to note that Caliberlink has been set up by WDA as a dedicated placement agency for PMEs with career services and support, I am concerned whether we can cope with large numbers of local PMEs being displaced when economic downturn or depression happens.",19,38,012-001-090-003-015-038,509

Each of our polyclinics sees an average of about 1,000 patients per day, a few even see up to 1,200 to 1,400 patients a day. Waiting times at polyclinics, hospital accident and emergency departments and specialist outpatient clinics have lengthened. The hospitals are bursting at their seams. With a greying population and our baby boomers hitting 65 years and above in the next 10 years, I am sure that they will have to cope with more medical and healthcare issues for our population. While there will be an increase of 4,100 hospital beds by 2020 and an increase of support care facilities in our communities, people are generally concerned whether we would be able to cope with the future healthcare needs. By 2020, the population may be at 6 million compared to 5.31 million now. A simple calculation will show that the corresponding increase in hospital beds is less than even 1% of the increase in total population. Is this a realistic figure? While we expect existing hospitals to be able to accept the stretch as well, is this not an unlikely prospect with current healthcare facilities filled to the brim?

I note from the footnote in page 40 of the White Paper that there will be increases in foreign healthcare manpower for the healthcare sector up to 28,000 in 2030. When I speak to our local healthcare employees and union members, they value the support and help from our foreign healthcare employees. In fact, the HSEU has many foreign healthcare employees as our union members. To meet the healthcare needs of our people, we may well need sufficiently trained healthcare professionals at all levels from various departments − from allied, ancillary, nursing and doctors.

I am not saying that we go for low or no growth, as the Workers' Party had proposed. A low or slow growth -- in fact even starting from 2013 is what I am reading from the proposal that they just put up -- would mean that most of our SMEs will stop growing and Singapore will stagnate and decline.

By my calculations, that means that Singaporeans will have to retire later; we will have people who will work very hard throughout their lives and with no chance of enjoying their retirement after all the effort they have put in to build up their families, their country. I think this basically is also not a solution that is workable. We have to be realistic about this. Therefore, I am proposing that we do not abandon the Dubai model -- in fact, adopt it -- and depend our growth on some resident workforce, resident population but also a transient population that can support future growth.",7,126,012-001-090-003-015-126,597

We all know that instant trees cannot grow strong roots and can be uprooted in difficult times. I, therefore, once again urge the Government to slow down and plan on reaching their population target over a longer time horizon. Twenty-thirty is too soon. I do not think so that we can live with 6.9 million population here in Singapore by 2030. We may be able to handle it in 2050, but no one really knows. But the rate of growth is no different from what we have seen in the past, so I think we should slow down.

There is just the same old measures, like life-long upgrading, Workfare, job-matching and placement programmes.",22,173,012-001-090-003-015-173,644

I would touch briefly on these plans to support a possible population of 6.9 million by 2030.

I am mindful that this is not a complete experience because, unlike many commuters, when I do go on such visits, I do not face the constraint of getting to a particular destination by a defined time. Nonetheless, I think my conclusions are something that most Singaporeans will share and agree with.",2,182,012-001-090-003-015-182,653
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-015,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"First, during the morning peak hours, outside of the school holiday periods, it is very congested. I can understand why commuters are frustrated because for them this is a daily experience. Second, many commuters have to take a feeder to reach an MRT station, or from the station to their final destination. This can add quite significantly to their total journey time. Third, the variable waiting times and crowdedness on buses mean that the journey is less predictable and so it can fluctuate from day to day and this adds to the stress that they face. And fourth, the occasional train disruption can wreck their plans for the day. Therefore, in speaking about our long and short term plans, I hope to address and improve on these areas.",3,183,012-001-090-003-015-183,654

We would have completed five more lines across the island -- the Downtown Line, Thomson Line, Eastern Region Line, Cross Island Line and Jurong Region Line -- to join the four that we already have. Perhaps we may have even more new lines under construction by then. We had a very interesting exchange on workers. I therefore ask that whoever is in charge will give us special dispensation on foreign workers for MRT construction, in particular, so that we can bring all these plans to fruition.",4,184,012-001-090-003-015-184,655
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-015,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"So what, you may ask, about all these new lines that we are adding? Well, what it means is that we will have a much expanded public transport network, we would have added new capacity, and I believe that the travel experience will improve significantly as commuters are distributed over a larger network. By 2030, eight in 10 households will be within a 10-minute walk from an MRT station. Ninety percent of our buildings in the CBD area will be within a five-minute walk. The rail network will bring us to almost all key parts of Singapore and many can be less dependent on the vagaries of the bus feeders to reach their destinations.",5,185,012-001-090-003-015-185,656
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-015,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"However, the 2030 vision of a very convenient and high-quality public transport system is not so easy for many Singaporeans to visualise. What we have experienced in public transport in the last few years has affected how we view the future. We should have invested more in building new lines and buying new trains in the early years of the last decade. As the Prime Minister had explained, this was because of the very challenging economic circumstances, and we also had the difficult experience of the North East Line opening in 2003 and operating for a number of years with ridership well below what was planned for. Because we were too prudent and conservative in public transport infrastructure investment during the early years of the last decade, we now find ourselves doing a lot of catching up.",6,186,012-001-090-003-015-186,657

Between now and 2017, the Downtown Line will open in phases and this will add significant new capacity to the east-west corridor. People living around the Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Panjang areas will have a new and faster route to the city centre by 2015. This will help to relieve congestion at Jurong East and along the East-West Line. Likewise, people in Tampines will have a choice of two MRT lines to get to the city centre while others along Bedok Reservoir and along Ubi will no longer need to rely on the East-West Line.",9,189,012-001-090-003-015-189,660

I do not expect that there will be such a sharp increase in ridership. Hence, what this implies is that for most commuters taking the train into the city, the journey will be less crowded by then.",11,191,012-001-090-003-015-191,662

I have already announced that during the off-peak hours, no commuter will have to wait more than five minutes for a train, except very early in the morning and very late at night. We are targeting to apply this requirement to the North-South and East-West Lines this year, and we will extend it to the other MRT lines by around 2015.",12,192,012-001-090-003-015-192,663

Since its launch last September, we have added about 90 new buses, improved about 50 bus services, and implemented five new routes. Feedback has been positive. Recruitment of drivers permitting -- again, local or foreign -- I aim to accelerate the BSEP. This year, we will add about 190 new buses, which means that half of the 550 buses promised under the five-year programme will be on our roads by the end of the year. This will allow us to roll out more new routes, and improvements to more bus services across the island. Commuters can, therefore, experience tangible improvements in shorter waiting times, less crowding, and better connectivity.",13,193,012-001-090-003-015-193,664
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-015,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"I have also asked LTA to see how we can tap on the resources of private bus operators in specific areas to accelerate this programme. LTA will be tendering some of the new BSEP routes, and I invite private operators to respond. We will contract out more City Direct-type bus services which run during the morning peak hours along the expressways into the city, and we will also work with operators to see if it is possible to extend such contracting arrangements to other new, shorter services, for instance, localised routes in estates that feed to MRT stations. If successful, this will allow us to scale up the BSEP beyond the 550 buses that the two public bus operators are committed to implement, and give us the resources to implement more new routes and other service improvements.",14,194,012-001-090-003-015-194,665
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-015,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"But even with the BSEP, commuters tell me that waiting times for buses at their bus stops are irregular. Sometimes, they wait a long time for their bus, and then two or three buses come together, especially during peak hours – a not too uncommon experience judging by the smiles I see.",15,195,012-001-090-003-015-195,666
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-015,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"Therefore, even as we operate more buses, we will need to work with bus operators to improve the reliability of their buses en-route, so that commuters experience more regular waiting times. There are a number of examples, like in London and Seoul, of how they have implemented a framework and worked with the operators to achieve this. They shared with me how they have managed, with difficulty, to improve bus reliability over a number of years through an incentive and penalty system based on commuters' expected waiting times at the bus stop. Their bus operators have to adopt a new mindset, invest substantially in fleet management capabilities to monitor their buses, and make appropriate interventions so buses arrive at more regular intervals along the entire route. This is something that I am keen to try out and LTA will begin to trial this scheme on some services in the second half of this year.",16,196,012-001-090-003-015-196,667
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-015,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"But to derive the full benefits from the measures that I have just mentioned, we must also give more priority to buses on our roads. Today, we have about 180 kilometres of bus lanes and about 200 Mandatory Give-Way to Buses scheme. Over the next two years, we will spend close to $50 million to improve bus reliability, such as adding another 30 kilometres of bus lanes, increasing the Mandatory Give-Way scheme to another 150 bus stops, and quadruple the number of bus hubs from 10 to 40 so that more buses can pick up passengers at the same time. We will also step up bus lane enforcement as infringements will result in delays for buses and commuters.",17,197,012-001-090-003-015-197,668
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-015,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"We will also improve train reliability. A train that has to be withdrawn from service leads to ripple effects like overcrowding and delays throughout the rail network and inconveniences commuters greatly. The Joint Team that was formed between LTA-SMRT has achieved some success over the past six months. Train withdrawals on the North-South and East-West Lines have decreased sharply. Today, we experience about one train withdrawal for every 1,000 trips on these two lines and we aim to improve this by another about 20% by the end of the year. We will improve further in subsequent years, and aim to halve the withdrawal rate to one train withdrawal every 2,000 trips as we upgrade the trains and place more attention on preventive maintenance.",18,198,012-001-090-003-015-198,669
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-015,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"Besides supply-side measures, we also want to encourage commuters to spread out their travel to outside the peak hours, and we have introduced several incentive schemes to do so. Commuters who are able and willing to travel off-peak on the SMRT network today can already save up to 50 cents off their rail fare if they exit at designated stations in CBD before 7.45 am. The scheme has seen some initial success, and we have seen about 3% to 4% of commuters move their travel period out of the peak hours. We will continue to see how this can be made even more effective, and will consider further improvements possibly later this year. Besides this SMRT scheme which gives an immediate discount, we also have a scheme for off-peak commuters to accumulate points for more sizeable rewards, of up to $200, when they travel off-peak. This is the ""Incentives for Singapore's Commuters"" scheme, or INSINC for short, and it has been quite popular, especially among the younger and more tech-savvy commuters. We have seen their membership grow from about 35,000 last October to 60,000 participants today. Our analysis shows that for this group who is more interested in such arrangement, about 10% of them has shifted from peak to off-peak travel.",19,199,012-001-090-003-015-199,670
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-015,The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew),"We expect the effect of these schemes to continue to grow, as commuters take time to make arrangements to adjust their travel behaviour, and we will certainly continue to review them for greater effectiveness. In the mean time, we are also working with major employers and institutions, especially in the CBD, to inject more flexibility in their working hours, and to help them understand the travel needs of their employees. This will enable them to implement the necessary workplace practices to facilitate their employees to travel off-peak.",20,200,012-001-090-003-015-200,671

A possible 6.9 million population by 2030 is the parameter that we are using to plan for our land transport infrastructure. We have sized the doubling of the rail network so that there is sufficient buffer for the projected or possible 30% population increase as well as change in travel behaviours.

Over the next five years, we will significantly increase capacity with additional trains, we will open a new MRT segment every year, and we will work hard to improve reliability for train and bus services.

2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-015,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"There have been reactions from many segments of the population. I think it augurs well because it shows that Singaporeans are interested. With our current population of 5.3 million, we already experienced the challenges in our infrastructure. Minister Lui touched on crowded trains, waiting time for healthcare services, rising costs of housing in our already crowded city, and many are anxious and asking how? How is it going to be possible, as it is already so tough? How is it possible to have more people? It is already straining our resources. What is the impact going to be? What is the quality of life going to be? What are the social implications of integrating more foreigners into our midst?",3,206,012-001-090-003-015-206,677
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-015,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"So while many have recognised that Singapore has progressed, their concerns are whether Singaporeans really able to participate in this progress. There is concern on the growing income inequality and how individuals − individual Singaporeans − are affected. There are sentiments that while Singapore has advanced as a country, there are also negative aspects of this progress – congestion, overcrowding, higher costs and definitely a faster pace of life and the tension tradeoffs arising from this.",4,207,012-001-090-003-015-207,678
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-015,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"So I got caught up personally in all these discussions and I felt the same things myself. But I do implore both the House as well as Singaporeans to take a step back for a while and to understand the key thrust of this White Paper. While the White Paper discusses the demographic challenges and the policy considerations, there is a greater underlying issue. The key issue is that of sustaining Singapore. There is no Core Singapore if there is no Singapore. By 2015, what the implications of our TFR means, say, at 1.2, assuming no change and an ageing population that is living longer, is that we will shrink. We will shrink as a population.",5,208,012-001-090-003-015-208,679

So currently one of nearly every six persons aged 20 and above is 65 years of age. Come 2030 or 2025, based on the projections, one in every three-and-a-half, and come 2030, one in every three. Why am I calling out these numbers? Because it sunk in on me as well, as to why we are doing this. What is the intent of the Population White Paper? It is about planning.

2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-015,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Therefore, it is imperative that we address this. But I also share with all Members of the House who have expressed this earlier, like Mr Liang Eng Hwa and a few others, that we need to pay attention to the concerns of citizens, of what citizens are experiencing today, if we are ever going to get the confidence or the attention of Singaporeans to worry about the future.",7,210,012-001-090-003-015-210,681
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-015,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Now let me talk about the Marriage and Parenthood package. I think there has been some discussion about this is a half-hearted attempt. And I beg to differ because I know about the outreach that has been done, the consultations with Singaporeans − people who want to have children, people who desire to get married − to understand what the issues and the factors were and to try and address that through the Marriage and Parenthood package. Because younger Singaporeans are better educated, they have more options, and they are investing time in their careers. Many have opportunities to pursue their personal goals. As a result, they are marrying later and often only when they feel they have sufficiently established themselves. Their expectations have also shifted. For example, whereas previous generations did not expect to own a home before starting a family, young Singaporeans today increasingly place priority on home ownership before having children.",8,211,012-001-090-003-015-211,682
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-015,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"In our outreach efforts, to understand what these factors were, many expressed the concerns around costs and affordability of having and raising children, achieving work-life balance and career goals. So while on getting married and having children – I think we all recognise it is a personal choice – hearing our Singaporeans and hearing their aspirations, the policies if done well can help tilt this balance in favour of having children for those who want to have children. So I am glad to see the enhancements of the Marriage and Parenthood package and I think that we should not belittle that because it is to support young couples who want to have children, who want to get married early and have children.",9,212,012-001-090-003-015-212,683
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-015,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"The introduction of the priority housing to make it easier for couples expecting or with young children to get their flats earlier and to be able to rent flats while waiting for their BTO flats is welcomed. Thirty per cent of all new flats are now reserved for young families who will now have priority in balloting for new HDB flats. Fifty per cent of flats for first-timers in HDB sales or balance flat exercises will also be reserved for them. So with the parenthood priority scheme, effective January 2013, which is now, couples with at least one child below the age of 16 will be boosted, because basically they are going to have priority to the front of the queue or at least they will get priority to the queue on the BTO flats. And that is significant. If we listen to what our young couples are saying, that is significant.",10,213,012-001-090-003-015-213,684
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-015,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),The enhanced Baby Bonus and the Medisave and the extension of the MediShield to cover congenital and neonatal conditions will help with costs and reduce uncertainties related to conceiving and raising children because we never can tell what is going to happen. Many parents have expressed the concerns when they have children. What does that mean when you have children that need a little bit more care especially when they are very young? So these help to address some of those anxieties as well. It does not take it all away but it helps to address some of them.,11,214,012-001-090-003-015-214,685
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-015,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Increasing the support for those requiring assistive reproductive technology will also help alleviate the costs and this is part of the package as well for those couples facing difficulty conceiving. Given fathers a week of paid paternity leave is a welcomed move to promote shared parenting. And a lot of times, it is not just about the father sharing the load. I am a parent myself and I benefited because my husband is very involved in the upbringing of our children, not in the child caring per se but really the upbringing of the children. And that makes for stronger children, stronger families, and I think that is a very welcomed move. So, albeit, I would say, it would have been nice if it was a little bit longer, but, of course, we always want more.",12,215,012-001-090-003-015-215,686
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-015,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"Another factor that is a key consideration for parents is the availability of quality preschool and childcare for their children. Being a parent myself as well, when my kids were very young − I have three − I remembered every time when my kids were ill, I was at work and if I did not know that they had good care, I would be very concerned and I would be extremely distracted. So, having good quality care, knowing that your kids are in an environment where they can thrive, they can learn, they can also be well taken care of – I think those are factors that will go a long way. And so I am looking forward to hearing what will be shared by the Ministers when they share about the initiatives around and what is being done in that space as well.",13,216,012-001-090-003-015-216,687
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-015,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"To help couples with children, employers need to adopt progressive human resource (HR) practices in hiring, having flexible work arrangements and including part-time work. I think there has been a lot of discussion around that. Recognising that men and women have changing priorities at different stages of their lives, organisations will need to adapt the HR policies to meet these priorities. This will give them sufficient time to adjust to life as young parents, provide relief to those who do not have other childcare options and ease the transitioning into childcare. Employers, I know, will have concerns on the implications on their businesses and the costs if they take on these measures. And it will be an investment on the part of employers to do so and, in some ways, these may seem destructive.",14,217,012-001-090-003-015-217,688

What we need to continue is to promote the value of family life and to renew our society's enthusiasm and support for families.

Somehow, when I listened to the debate over the last two years, I got a sense that people think that growth and economic growth is a bad word. Maybe they did not say it but I got that sense. So I am going to say, first of all, maybe we should read the White Paper a little bit better. It does not centre on economic growth, it does not centre on GDP, it centres on Singapore. But economic growth is required if we are really interested in the well-being of Singaporeans.",17,220,012-001-090-003-015-220,691

First of all, I want to say that the Deputy Prime Minister Teo did say – in fact, I was a little bit concerned because growth is going to slow down − it is a fundamental shift. So I am not sure whether everybody read the White Paper well because it says growth is going to slow down. It is not going to be growth at all costs, and it is slowing down. But I think everyone recognises what is 2% to 3%, and I think the Deputy Prime Minister mentioned it is a fundamental shift, while we are growing, we will pay attention to making sure that we take consideration of that. On economic growth, I think we all must recognise and people do recognise it is important.",18,221,012-001-090-003-015-221,692
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-015,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast),"But let us also not take it for granted that growth will just happen. Because just like in business, there are already two levers in any business. One is profit or top line. Let us not talk about profit, let us talk about top line, and one is bottom line. If we all just focus on cost, there will come a time – that is for the short term, it will solve problems – when it is not going to be enough. Then you are going to need to grow and if you do not invest early to growing, we are not going to be able to catch up. So I think we need to balance the two. Cost management is absolutely important and has to done but prudence is important. But we cannot stop growing, so we need to calibrate them so the balance is important. Let us recognise that. Because without growth, we will not have jobs. We talk about making sure Singapore has quality jobs. Where are those jobs going to come without growth?.",19,222,012-001-090-003-015-222,693

I am not sure whether the Members of the Workers' Party saw today's headlines  ""Several Foreign Firms Prepare to Leave Singapore"".

So it is important if they leave, where are the jobs? And I am not talking about just foreign firms leaving – it just so happens the headline is ""Foreign Firms"", but our local firms, my SMEs and, in my constituency, I have many industrial associations and these are viable businesses. But some of them are either streaming down, they are not scaling, or some of them are shutting parts of their operations because they cannot fill those jobs! So what happens? SMEs hire about 70% of Singaporeans or offer 70% of our jobs. MNCs, foreign companies, but guess what? Of the large companies, guess what? About 60% of Singaporeans work in these companies. Small companies, again, how many of our locals? About 60%, around there. So think about it. That is what it means.",21,224,012-001-090-003-015-224,695

That is my entire career, 20 years. I was successful as a sales person and got promoted to becoming a manager. But if I had applied the skills that I had used as a salesperson to be a manager, then I would have failed miserably.

It is not that our education system does not prepare our people for it. What we need to do is look at not just continual learning but what kind of career development that we have to do for people, especially if we have a big group of PMETs, we have to prepare them. What we need to do is think about the HR practices, the HR competency in this country. How do we build up that competency, how do we ensure that we work with companies that operate here, local and foreign, in building up HR practices that will allow Singaporeans to continue to grow and develop in organisations, or in professions, or in particular segments and sectors of the population as they progress.

That is also impacting our businesses and I was very glad that Minister Lui talked about some of the measures about transport and how it will help Singaporeans but I want to talk about it in relation how it affects businesses, small businesses. We heard about some of that in the PQs earlier. This is about the COEs that companies are facing for their goods vehicles that they need for their businesses. As the hon. Member Mr Christopher de Souza said these are the people who depend on our roads to make a living. Many of our businesses here need vehicles to be able to provide their goods and services and move them around. Many are telling me that they are finding it very difficult when they want to renew the COEs, the cost of that is high",2,3,012-001-090-003-017-003,702
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-017,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"Let me give you the example. Just a year ago, COEs for the goods vehicles open category, it was $30,000 and now it is $60,000. So, it is a double impact to them. If we look at the open category as well, the COEs have gone up. We all know the prices there. A lot of these businesses need these vehicles to be able to transport. I hope we can look at a different system that is outside of the COE, for people who need these vehicles, how we can look at managing a more reasonable cost of operating this. There are some of them who are deciding not to continue their businesses because of that. For some, their service levels are affected.",3,4,012-001-090-003-017-004,703

2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-017,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"   Yes. While the infrastructure and spaces are being used, we have to pay attention to the side effects of all these developments – the noise, the privacy impacts and just that little bit of attention to detail. With greater density and proximity comes greater stress and irritation. And it does affect social cohesion. The way we face buildings, how we place buildings, the proximity of buildings will make a difference. I do ask that we look at that and continue to look at the affordability of our housing. Many of the Members have touched on that so I will not touch on that again.",1,7,012-001-090-003-017-007,706

This White Paper as much as I was asking myself, ""why now?"", I recognise that it is an important point that we have to start planning. I will implore that we continue to involve Singaporeans in the details of this plan. The very fact that all different segments have expressed their concerns, I think they have ideas and we should hear them out and we should involve them as much in the plans. It is important and we have to continue to do that. I want to remind the House that it was against the landscape of impossibilities, constraints that Singapore and our people made it possible to be here today. So, let us not forget that. With that and with our people together, collaboratively, I think we can build the future we want for Singapore.",2,8,012-001-090-003-017-008,707

As it is, most of the residents who stay in my area are feeling the constraints of a crowded city. The trains are crowded. There is a shortage of housing and for some of the older citizens they were also saying that even getting places in hospitals are difficult. It was certainly with a heavy heart that I read the headlines.",1,9,012-001-090-003-017-009,708
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-017,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Now, when I actually read the White Paper itself and followed by the subsequent clarifications by Ministers, I had a little bit more reassurance. It is pretty clear that the number of 6.9 million is really a number for planning purposes which actually means that the bigger the number the more infrastructure we will have, the more houses we will have, the more transport we will have. In that sense, the bigger the number you plan for, the more room you will have and the more ease you will have. If we do not hit that number, for example, that means there will be more space on trains, more space on buses and so on. In that sense, with regard to my initial knee-jerk reaction -- that we are going to have too many people and our island cannot deal with it -- I am a little bit reassured. Of course, the real proof of the pudding will be if these effects are actually felt by Singaporeans over the next couple of years. So, hopefully this is something that will play out.",2,10,012-001-090-003-017-010,709
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-017,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Now there are two particular things I want to deal with in my speech. The first is how we can make sure that even as we expand infrastructure capacity and a large number of foreigners come into Singapore, we can continue to preserve opportunities and employment for Singaporeans. The second question I will deal with is immigration and whether we need it, because that seems to be the fundamental difference between what the White Paper proposes and what the Workers' Party is putting forward. And I think both of these are very important issues.",3,11,012-001-090-003-017-011,710
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-017,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Let me deal with the first point in terms of opportunities. By and large, as Singaporeans age, there will be the risk of a diminishing workforce. But even in that, there will be industries that have opportunities, there will be industries that can grow around helping the old. One area, in particular, for example, is medicine. There will definitely be a need for doctors. I am also hoping that as we expand the opportunities, we also try to preserve more of these opportunities for Singaporeans, specifically. I know many young doctors, for example, one who studied with me in the university who could not get a place in medicine at NUS. His parents were able afford an education abroad, he was one of the top in Cambridge but he could not get a place in NUS. There were many others who may not have had a chance to study medicine in Singapore, even though they may have had very good grades. What I am hoping is that as we expand the economy, we still do look out for opportunities that Singaporeans will want and expand places there because I know that there are some jobs Singaporeans may not want, but medicine is not one of them",4,12,012-001-090-003-017-012,711
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-017,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Let me go a bit broader on opportunities. The second point is this. I also think there is scope for us to make sure that opportunities come to Singaporeans first. This is actually not inconsistent with the Paper but it may actually help us achieve the tighter targets because it will give us measures by which we can reduce the number of foreigners in such a way that it tilts the playing field in favour of Singaporeans. The second suggestion is actually something that comes out of what the EU does, which is, if you want to offer a job to a foreigner, you first have to advertise for it within the whole of the EU. And only if you do not get any applicants, can you then make a case to get a foreigner in. This could be an additional level, an additional barrier we put to companies that wish to employ foreigners. I think this would be particularly important for young professionals, engineers, accountants -- and perhaps in this area I should declare my interest, I am a professional working in a foreign law firm.",5,13,012-001-090-003-017-013,712
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-017,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"By ensuring that the opportunities that come out of growth are channelled to Singaporeans first, I think we will make sure that Singaporeans will be able to benefit from this growth. This will be particularly important to young families, to people who are coming out into the workforce, undergraduates. I do not think criteria for employment passes should be based on salary alone because that would still create competition at all levels. Our PMETs are also feeling the strain. They are saying we may earn $4,000 or $8,000, but we are not rich. We should also make sure that we protect the PMETs as well, the young working professionals.",6,14,012-001-090-003-017-014,713
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-017,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The third thing that I think will be helpful is to provide greater employment security. Now, Singapore's employment laws are very, very flexible. ""Very flexible"", meaning it is very easy for people to fire employees. Now the good news is that because there are a lot of jobs available, it is easy for Singaporeans to find new jobs. One specific measure that would help, if we give greater employment protection to employees, there are at least three suggestions that I can make on this front. The first is to actually include a statutory protection period for employees who work for a long period of time. For example, our current Employment Act only protects employees who earn less than $2,000 in general, or $4,500 if they are workmen. So, this means that a lot of the Singaporean workforce does not get the very detailed protection by the Employment Act.",7,15,012-001-090-003-017-015,714
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-017,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The second, the main protection of the Employment Act is that it actually provides minimum periods of notice that have to be provided before you terminate an employee. If you work for less than 26 weeks, you have to provide one day's notice. If an employee has worked for 26 weeks to two years, you have to provide one week's notice and this scales up all the way to employees who have worked for five years, where you have to provide four weeks of notice. What that means is that even for long-serving employees, there is no real advantage to staying a long time because the most you get is one month of notice. On the other hand, if you look at the UK, for example, they have increasing notice period based on the duration of employment. It basically starts at one week of notice if you have two years or less of employment, and it increases by a week for every year of service up to 12 years. So, you are an employee who has worked for 12 years, that means you get at least three months notice before you can be terminated. The main benefit of this is that employees will have some certainty. They do not have to worry about ""If I lose my job, what is going to happen? How will I survive for the next month? How will I make my payments?"" This would at least give them a runway of three months or so if they have worked for a long time, and also incentivises employees to stay with the employer longer.",8,16,012-001-090-003-017-016,715
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-017,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Another aspect is creating statutory protection for unfair dismissal. Now, at the moment, this is not a major form of redress for employees who earn more than the Employment Act salaries because the maximum they can recover in compensation for losing their job is say a month of notice period. Most employees do not take action if they have lost their job unfairly but you hear a lot of stories about people saying, ""I lost my job because I did national service"". Now they do not go for hearing because it does not make economic sense to. But if you have statutory protection for unfair dismissal, then there is a low-cost means by which employees can seek redress for these kinds of unfair dismissals. I guess the point of this is to make sure that Singaporeans do not get unfairly discriminated against. Now, these are the sort of measures that our changes to manpower policy will help to tilt the playing field in favour of Singaporeans and give them greater protection, even as our economy expands and even as we are getting more foreigners. The key point is, getting in more foreigners can create more opportunities but we want to make sure these opportunities stay with Singaporeans as far as possible.",9,17,012-001-090-003-017-017,716
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-017,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Now let me deal with the second point on whether or not immigration is necessary because I think this is the crux of the difference between both sides of the House. The choice we face is very stark. We have heard from both Mr Teo Siong Seng and Mr Inderjit Singh about the pain that SMEs are going through. SMEs are not just old-fashioned companies who need time to change and can change miraculously. SMEs also include new businesses. I have a friend from primary school who was working in the UK for a very long time. He came back to Singapore heeding the Government's call for entrepreneurs. But he said he had a very, very hard time setting up a business here. In particular, he wanted to start a business providing travel services to Central Asia, Russia and Kazakhstan. He had an intern who could speak Kazak, German and Russian – a foreigner obviously. And he said there is no way he could get someone with those set of skills in Singapore. It was almost impossible for him to get a work permit of any sort, even under the current scheme. In the end, my friend appealed through two MPs – not me; two other MPs – and the appeal completely failed, and he said ""Your PAP Government is completely messing up. You encourage entrepreneurs to come here but at the same time you do not let us get the workers we need."" And his was a new business. In the end, he managed to get a pass after paying $4,000 or more in salary, which he is not happy about because that is a huge strain on his cost.",10,18,012-001-090-003-017-018,717

2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-017,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Let us go a bit further because immigration is important not only for existing SMEs, and so on, but also for a lot of the expansion plans the Government is currently undertaking. For example, if we are building new HDB flats and building new MRTs, we need construction workers. Are you going to get a sufficient workforce of construction workers without foreign workers to build all these capacity in the next few years?",15,23,012-001-090-003-017-023,722
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-017,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"One of the things about immigration is this. You have to make decisions on whether or not you allow foreigners to come in on a day-to-day basis. You do not have the benefit of hindsight to say at the end of the year, ""I did not hit my 1% growth in workforce, therefore, I will let immigrants in"". You need to make the decision right now. You do not know whether you will get the 1% or not at the time you make the decision. You have to make the decision on projections.",16,24,012-001-090-003-017-024,723
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-017,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The reality is that you do not have hindsight when you make the decision. If you shut off the tap now, assuming you will get to the 1% growth, you will paralyse the new building, you will prevent new businesses that require the special skills to start and you will kill all the SMEs. This is why I think a tightening is probably the best way forward. I agree with the broad principle we should move the jobs to Singaporeans. I also think we should assist SMEs, and I think SPRING has a lot of schemes, and I hope those schemes can be introduced to SMEs more. I am sure Mr Inderjit Singh would have more details on how that can help and what else needs to be done. But I think the Government should assist with the transition process, but it is not something you can do overnight. It is a long process.",17,25,012-001-090-003-017-025,724
2013-02-05,A Sustainable Population for A Dynamic Singapore,012-001-090-003-017,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"In conclusion, this Population Paper is one that I support. It is the one that I support because, ultimately, the first thing that we will see is a broader expansion of infrastructure which I think is something everyone wants. The second we would see is a tightening of foreign labour and foreign people coming in. I think we can do more things on the manpower side to make sure these opportunities favour Singaporeans. And the third, I think, is the immediate idea of shutting out the tap to new foreign labour is something that will pretty much destroy our economy if we do it right now. In that sense, at least gradually tightening it gives businesses a runway and a chance to adapt.",18,26,012-001-090-003-017-026,725

Last year, 12 projects were, however, delayed. There were three main causes for the delay. First, mid-way through some projects, the residents asked to modify the scope of work and for additional items to be included. Second, while the projects benefit most residents, they may affect some residents, for example in blocking their view. Additional time was then required to consult the affected residents in order to resolve such competing interests among residents. Finally, in some projects, the service providers encountered some unforeseen site constraints and took more time to complete the underground services diversion works.",1,2,012-001-090-003-019-002,734

However, the school faced financial challenges in its operations in Singapore. Its revenues turned out to be lower than projected while its costs exceeded projections due to factors such as the appreciation of the SGD against the USD and the construction boom in 2007.
