2015-07-14,Measures to Help Residents whose Flats Do Not Enjoy Direct Lift Access,012-002-093-021-001,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"  Thank you. While we try to offer the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) to as many HDB blocks as possible, there are some blocks where the LUP is not feasible due to technical constraints or prohibitively high cost. Through the adoption of new technologies and innovative solutions, HDB has reduced the number of such blocks to about 200. We continue to explore ways so that even more households can benefit.",1,6,012-002-093-021-001-006,6
2015-07-14,Measures to Help Residents whose Flats Do Not Enjoy Direct Lift Access,012-002-093-021-001,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"For example, HDB is piloting two new solutions - the Pneumatic Vacuum Elevator (PVE) and the Vertical Platform Lift (VPL). The PVE has been turned on for public trial last month, while the VPL is currently being evaluated. HDB is testing the new lift solutions to ensure that they are safe and technically reliable before rolling them out. Surveys will also be conducted to gather feedback from users of the PVE and VPL, and the results will help us determine if they are suitable for wider implementation.",2,7,012-002-093-021-001-007,7
2015-07-14,Measures to Help Residents whose Flats Do Not Enjoy Direct Lift Access,012-002-093-021-001,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"Residents who wish to move to a unit with direct lift access can sell their existing flat and either buy a resale flat or a new subsidised flat if they meet eligibility conditions. Meanwhile, Singaporean residents who are in urgent need of direct lift access due to medical conditions or disability may approach HDB for housing and financing assistance. HDB assesses each request on a case-by-case basis to see how best we can render help.",3,8,012-002-093-021-001-008,8
2015-07-14,Measures to Help Residents whose Flats Do Not Enjoy Direct Lift Access,012-002-093-021-001,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"  I thank the Senior Minister of State for his reply to my Parliamentary Question (PQ). In my experience so far, as the Senior Minister of State had mentioned, HDB does look at each case on a case-by-case basis. The experience of some of these residents is that they want to move out but they cannot; and even through appeals, they cannot get through because most of them are immobile and aged. Therefore, if they want to buy a better flat, it is very difficult to get a loan. Sometimes, they have already taken two concessionary loans. And if they want to downgrade, they seem to have a lot of difficulties in doing so. Many of them have not been successful in such appeals, although the Senior Minister of State mentioned that HDB does look at these on an individual basis. Will the HDB consider giving even more special consideration for such families, especially those who are aged and hardly mobile.",1,9,012-002-093-021-001-009,9
2015-07-14,Measures to Help Residents whose Flats Do Not Enjoy Direct Lift Access,012-002-093-021-001,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"Second question is this  specifically to the number of LUP flats, there are about 200 left, as I understand it. HDB has done about 98% of flats through the LUP; there are just 2% of flats left. Many residents I meet ask, ""There is just 2% left. Why does HDB not consider removing that cap? There are many flats out there that are technically feasible for LUP, but just that they cannot meet the cost cap."" Given that there are just so few left, why does HDB not consider removing the cost cap?",2,10,012-002-093-021-001-010,10
2015-07-14,Measures to Help Residents whose Flats Do Not Enjoy Direct Lift Access,012-002-093-021-001,Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang),"One more question – I am glad to hear that the pilot trials are underway. The question would be would the pilots resolve the cost cap issues, and what is the likelihood?",3,11,012-002-093-021-001-011,11
2015-07-14,Measures to Help Residents whose Flats Do Not Enjoy Direct Lift Access,012-002-093-021-001,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"  Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. Our assistance rendered to households facing medical conditions and mobility issues is very targeted and specific. So, I would encourage the Member to refer those cases to us to look and see how best we can help them. If they are willing to be open to flats with lift access in other locations, I am sure we can find alternatives for them.",1,12,012-002-093-021-001-012,12
2015-07-14,Measures to Help Residents whose Flats Do Not Enjoy Direct Lift Access,012-002-093-021-001,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"The 200 blocks or so that are left in the LUP that cannot be done up, as I have said, it is either because of cost reasons or because of technical constraints. For cost reasons, the range is very wide. It can be as high as $200,000 per benefiting unit. In cases like these, if you build a conventional new lift, it serves only two or maybe four units. So, the cost is very high. We have to consider whether that is the best use of our resources. For $200,000, you can build a brand new 3-room flat. And also, if the residents were to have a share, the burden on the residents will also be very high.",2,13,012-002-093-021-001-013,13
2015-07-14,Measures to Help Residents whose Flats Do Not Enjoy Direct Lift Access,012-002-093-021-001,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"As for our pilot trials, the vacuum and platform lifts are low-cost alternatives. The vacuum lift is one that works on differential air pressure. But such lifts will have limitations in terms of how tall a building they can serve. Typically, it is a two- to three-storey building. For flats that have such problems – low-rise flats, very few benefiting units – technically, if the space and so on can accommodate, this might be the solution. We are doing the trial now. We have to see how the public will respond to the trial. The downside, though, is that it is smaller and much slower, about one-fifth or one-quarter of the speed of a normal lift. People who use it would be wheelchair users who really need the access and do not have other alternatives.",3,14,012-002-093-021-001-014,14

2015-07-14,Measures to Help Residents whose Flats Do Not Enjoy Direct Lift Access,012-002-093-021-001,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"  The two trials that we talk about, one has been installed in a commercial building. I think it is about three-storey high. The other one – the platform lift – has been installed in a car park complex, which is also a three-storey high building. The first one is already open to trial; we just started. A fair amount of trial period would be at least six months to gauge the response. The longer we have it, the more we can also ascertain its reliability because it all depends on the traffic and how people use it, and whether they can live up to the manufacturers' promise. The other platform lift is still under trial, to be commissioned soon.",1,17,012-002-093-021-001-017,17
2015-07-14,Measures to Help Residents whose Flats Do Not Enjoy Direct Lift Access,012-002-093-021-001,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"So, I think a reasonable period of six months to a year would be good, before we roll out to more estates for implementation.",2,18,012-002-093-021-001-018,18
2015-07-14,Measures to Help Residents whose Flats Do Not Enjoy Direct Lift Access,012-002-093-021-001,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"  Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State about the trials. We are trying to solve the issue of very few benefiting units, which cannot afford the cost, but why do we have these trials in commercial buildings or car parks where they are public areas and probably experience heavier usage? So, my question is whether the assessment would be equitable in an HDB housing setting?",1,19,012-002-093-021-001-019,19
2015-07-14,Measures to Help Residents whose Flats Do Not Enjoy Direct Lift Access,012-002-093-021-001,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"The second question is, I hear that the cost would be something that will be more favourable. May I know with these two new systems, what is the minimum number of benefiting units that can justify the cost?",2,20,012-002-093-021-001-020,20
2015-07-14,Measures to Help Residents whose Flats Do Not Enjoy Direct Lift Access,012-002-093-021-001,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"The last question is, among the 200 blocks in Singapore which do not LUP, do they include blocks where most parts of the units have lifts but due to segmentation, some units are not benefiting from those? I have a few in my area. Will these units be eligible and considered for this new LUP if these trials are successful?",3,21,012-002-093-021-001-021,21
2015-07-14,Measures to Help Residents whose Flats Do Not Enjoy Direct Lift Access,012-002-093-021-001,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"  With regard to the last question, the 200-over blocks include those that are partially served by lifts to every floor now. Because of the block configuration and the way that they are designed – different heights and so on – certain parts of the block are just not possible to have lift access, whereas a good part of the block already has lift access to every floor.",1,22,012-002-093-021-001-022,22
2015-07-14,Measures to Help Residents whose Flats Do Not Enjoy Direct Lift Access,012-002-093-021-001,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"As for the trials, based on our estimation, we can extend to a few dozen of such low-rise blocks. They are all spread out nationwide. The various Members would know where they are. But, we are still gathering experience. One of the reasons why we do it in a commercial area, is because the usage is higher than residential. It would help us collect data faster, in terms of heavier frequency of use.",2,23,012-002-093-021-001-023,23

2015-07-14,Measures to Help Residents whose Flats Do Not Enjoy Direct Lift Access,012-002-093-021-001,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"The two trials that we talk about are meant for low-rise blocks. We have to look for other kinds of solutions that will bring the lift service all the way to the 12th floor. So far, Members may recall that initially, we had 1,000 blocks that were found to be difficult to have lift access. But through a combination of solutions, we managed to reduce them to about 200.",2,28,012-002-093-021-001-028,28
2015-07-14,Measures to Help Residents whose Flats Do Not Enjoy Direct Lift Access,012-002-093-021-001,Mr Lee Yi Shyan,"What are these solutions? Some of them are, for instance, lifts that do not use a lot of headroom. So, we can bring the lift all the way to the 12th floor because that is the maximum it can go. Otherwise, you will sacrifice the top floor – they will go without lifts. The other solution is a bubble lift – in some of the Members' areas, there are bubble lifts. These lifts do away with lift shafts, reducing the need to have strong foundational work required to support the lift shafts. The other solution would be building a long bridge to the lift shafts. In other words, you cannot bring the lift shaft so close to the building; instead, you have to extend it out because the buildings have got uneven vertical facades. So, the solution was to build outwards and build excess. We have to continue to explore such solutions. LUP has covered 98% of fats, as the Member has noticed. As in many things, the last 2% will be very challenging, very costly, and also technically difficult. We will see how best we can continue to find solutions for this 2%.",3,29,012-002-093-021-001-029,29

2015-07-14,Updating Change of Address in Identity Cards,012-002-093-021-002,Mr S Iswaran,"  Thank you. Madam, the National Registration Act requires NRIC holders to report any change in their place of residence to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) or Police within 28 days of the change. Any change will also be reflected on their NRICs. This applies to both property owners and rental tenants. Failure to do so is an offence and punishable by a fine or imprisonment, or both. Over the past three years, 61 persons were convicted for failure to report a change of their place of residence, an offence typically committed in furtherance of other criminal offences.",1,5,012-002-093-021-002-005,36

2015-07-14,Updating Change of Address in Identity Cards,012-002-093-021-002,Mr S Iswaran,"Similarly, owners or rental tenants should use their current address for commercial transactions, including obtaining a credit facility. A person who uses an outdated rental address when he is no longer staying at the location will not be traceable and will cause inconvenience to current residents of that address. If a tenant dishonestly uses an outdated address to secure a licensed loan, he can be punishable under the Penal Code. Police will also act firmly against borrowers who obtain unlicensed loans with their outdated addresses. Under section 28C of the Moneylenders Act, such borrowers may face imprisonment for up to a year.",3,7,012-002-093-021-002-007,38

2015-07-14,Support for Problem Gambling,012-002-093-021-007,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"  Mdm Speaker, problem gamblers and families who face such issues can seek help at two key service points – primarily the Thye Hua Kwan Problem Gambling Recovery Centre and the National Addictions Management Service (NAMS) which is located at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH). The former treats the less serious cases, while NAMS also treats the more severe pathological gamblers. In addition, there are other private and non-funded community and religious organisations that offer similar services as well.",1,2,012-002-093-021-007-002,127

This is about 60% more, in absolute numbers, 1,000 cases more than that between 2009 and 2011. We have looked at the increase and it is, primarily, due to greater public education efforts, which we have stepped up significantly which have raised awareness on problem gambling and encouraged help-seeking behaviour. It is important for people to step forward both as individuals, and for their families and loved ones to step forward to highlight those issues. We are encouraged that people are coming forward.",3,4,012-002-093-021-007-004,129
2015-07-14,Support for Problem Gambling,012-002-093-021-007,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The treatment plan for each problem gambler varies; it really depends on the severity of addiction. It usually involves a combination of counselling and different types of therapy, conducted on an individual or group basis. Psychiatric services may be extended for the more severe pathological gamblers. Financial and legal counselling services, where necessary, are also extended to help the problem gambler and his family cope. Recovering patients are encouraged to join support groups for longer term support.",4,5,012-002-093-021-007-005,130

The family is often in the best position to detect signs of problem gambling in their loved ones, encourage them to seek help, and also support them during treatment. Studies have shown that treatment works best if the problem gambler is accompanied by family members. The community also plays an important part in helping affected families access relevant information, resources and services. For example, more Family Service Centres have stepped up efforts to train their counsellors and social workers to provide the first line of counselling and assistance when families present problem gambling issues.",5,6,012-002-093-021-007-006,131

When Greece missed a US$1.7 billion repayment to the IMF on 30 June this year, the Fund declared Greece to be in arrears. When a member country misses a payment to the IMF, the IMF continues to work with that member to help it clear its arrears. This has been the case in previous instances of arrears. It is also pertinent that the IMF has preferred creditor status, which means that loans granted by the IMF to a member must be repaid ahead of all other creditors.",9,10,012-002-093-021-008-010,141

As an immediate step, the IMF will not permit the member further access to IMF resources.

So far, no country has had to face what is in effect expulsion from the IMF due to persistent arrears, and no losses have been realised on IMF loans.",11,12,012-002-093-021-008-012,143

However, the IMF has sizeable reserves that it can use to protect its members and lenders, should any loss arising from its loans to Greece eventually be realised. When member countries contribute resources to the IMF, our financial exposure is to the IMF and not the countries that the IMF lends to. The IMF, with the advantage it has from its preferred creditor status, has in turn always repaid its own creditors. Neither has the IMF ever had to use members' capital funds in the IMF to cover losses. On 1 July this year, the IMF reaffirmed that member countries' claims on the IMF are fully secure, and that it will continue to meet its obligations to its members and lenders.",13,14,012-002-093-021-008-014,145

To reiterate, this is because, when Singapore as a member of IMF contributes to its resources, our financial exposure is to the IMF and not the countries that the IMF lends to. I should also mention that Singapore's loan commitment under the IMF's 2012 Borrowing Arrangements have not been activated, as the IMF has sufficient financial resources for its current lending programmes.",15,16,012-002-093-021-008-016,147

If you look at the impact of the Greek crisis on the banking system in Europe – so, we look at the first round impact within Europe itself – even that alone, the direct impact of the Greek crisis on the banking system in Europe, that also is not that significant because European banks' exposures to Greece have come down significantly since the height of the crisis. The exposure was about 1.3% of the aggregrate balance sheets in September 2009, and it has since come down to 0.3% as at end of 2014.

My next area of concern is with regards to the appointment of private trustees by institutional creditors. Are there checks and balances in place to ensure that the appointed private trustees carry out their job efficiently and fairly especially given the fact that since bankruptcy cases can be very long-drawn. I believe that our efforts in improving the efficiency of the discharge process and in relieving the burden placed on our OA may be counter-productive if private trustees do not carry out their duties properly. This would in turn hinder the bankrupt's motivation and capability to break free of his status. As much as we want to encourage bankrupts to strive to repay their dues and enforce punitive action on those that do not, we need to ensure that the administrative system is fully capable of supporting this endeavour.",10,13,012-002-093-021-020-013,275

In a nutshell, the main aim of the Bill is to introduce a fixed timeframe of seven or nine years for bankrupts to be discharged even if they have not met their target contribution. The trade-off is that the bankrupt will have his name permanently on a public register. This Bill reminds me of a point I raised some years back.",1,18,012-002-093-021-020-018,280
2015-07-14,Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-021-020,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"After the Asian Financial Crisis, many businessmen were declared bankrupt with enormous debts, some amounting to tens of millions of dollars. One would intuitively think that a bankrupt with a small debt would find it easier to get himself discharged than one with a large debt. But things did not always work out that way. Some bankrupts with large debts were able to secure a discharge because, as the Courts have rightly and logically pointed out, there was no purpose keeping them bankrupt because it would be impossible for them to ever fully discharge their debts. On the other hand, those with smaller debts could, over time, pay off their debts and therefore found it difficult to be discharged until their debts were fully paid off. That did not seem to be correct.",2,19,012-002-093-021-020-019,281
2015-07-14,Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-021-020,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Under the Bill, bankrupts can now look forward to a fixed point of discharge, even if they do not repay the target sum. This is more equitable, so everyone is treated the same. But as the rule may encourage bankrupts to drag their feet and wait out the time period, the Bill provides that those who do not fully discharge their debts will have their names permanently retained on a register that the public and financial institutions can access. This strikes a sensible balance. It treats all bankruptcies equally regardless of the value of the debt and allows their discharge. It also incentivises a bankrupt to pay off his debts, which is also fair to his creditors.",3,20,012-002-093-021-020-020,282

Nonetheless I would suggest that the Official Assignee (OA) be given a wider discretion to remove a bankrupt's name from the public register in appropriate cases, even though the target contribution has not been fully paid. There may be instances where a person was made bankrupt not because of any financial irresponsibility or culpability, but in cases where he is not to be blamed – large medical bills or because he guaranteed a relative's debts. The OA's wider discretion would allow our new scheme to apply in a compassionate and flexible way where the circumstances warrant it.",4,21,012-002-093-021-020-021,283

Under the Bill, the OA determines the bankrupt's monthly and target contribution after the administration date of the bankruptcy. With regard to variations after the initial determination, section 86D only specifies three circumstances in which the OA may issue a certificate reducing the bankrupt's monthly and target contributions. Reductions in all other circumstances, as well as any upward revisions, will fall to be handled by the court upon the application of the OA.",5,22,012-002-093-021-020-022,284
2015-07-14,Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-021-020,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"There should be no need for the OA to apply to court to vary the contributions. After all, the OA makes the initial determination after taking into account a wide range of factors. Requiring the OA to seek a court order makes the process cumbersome, adds to the court's burden and increases costs. The court already has the power to review the decisions of the OA where a bankrupt or his creditor is dissatisfied with the OA's decision. The OA should be given the power to make all variations, and the court should step in only where the bankrupt or a creditor challenges that decision.",6,23,012-002-093-021-020-023,285

This is in principle a good idea. The OA's resources are limited and I have received feedback from residents that its officers are sometimes difficult to reach. The Bill seeks to lighten the burden on the Insolvency Office. Banks, finance companies and large businesses will be made to play a more active role in managing the bankrupt's affairs, and they have the resources to do that.",7,24,012-002-093-021-020-024,286

Since private trustees are appointed by the creditors, how will they ensure that they will act fairly? This is a matter of concern, since some 51 percent of bankruptcies involve financial institution creditors. I note that the OA is still responsible for overseeing and monitoring the private trustees. But given the OA's resources, how effective will that oversight be?

2015-07-14,Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-021-020,The Senior Minister of State for Education and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Ms Lim asked how the appointment of private trustees may affect the administration of bankruptcies. As mentioned in my speech yesterday, the OA acts as trustee in over 99 percent of bankruptcies. Out of the total number of bankruptcies, it is estimated that about 60% are brought by institutional creditors. With the requirement for institutional creditors to nominate private trustees, the number of cases handled by the OA would be reduced. Basically, the approach is that institutional creditors should bear the cost of administration, which will allow the OA to focus more on the smaller businesses and lenders who have lent to someone who goes into bankruptcy.",11,36,012-002-093-021-020-036,298

2015-07-14,Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-021-020,The Senior Minister of State for Education and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"I think here, again, the point is that we must first look at the creditors. If the creditor is an institution, then it is likely to have calculated its risks, including the costs of bankruptcy. The basic question is whether the ordinary taxpayer should pay for the bankruptcy administration, when the creditor is a big bank, or whether we should ask the bank to pay for the costs. Our view is that the bank should pay. The way it works in practice is that private trustees are likely to have provided estimates or ballpark figures of their fees to the bank, beforehand.",14,39,012-002-093-021-020-039,301

As to this, I would say that the amendments will encourage institutional creditors to be more prudent in granting credit and recovering unpaid debts. This may reduce the rate of default, which in turn, will help lower the overall costs of borrowing. The alternative is for taxpayers to continue to subsidise the costs of the OA administering these bankruptcies, which is not desirable.",18,43,012-002-093-021-020-043,305

We do not think it will. In fact, the opposite is intended. Bankrupts will have strong incentives to cooperate with the trustee as the trustees retain the discretion to discharge a bankrupt. And even if the trustee decides to discharge the bankrupt, the creditors may still apply to the court to object. Bankrupts who do not pay their Target Contribution in full will have a permanent record of their bankruptcy, which will affect their ability to obtain credit in future.",19,44,012-002-093-021-020-044,306

2015-07-14,Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-021-020,The Senior Minister of State for Education and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Mr Hri Kumar queried why the OA needs to apply to court to vary the Target Contribution after the initial determination. The Target Contribution is the key factor that affects a bankrupt's eligibility to be discharged. Once it is set, it becomes the reference point by which both the debtor and the creditor base their decisions and take their actions. Parties would have acted on the basis of certain expectations. If it can be changed too easily, it could be disruptive and could operate unfairly on either one of the interested parties, depending on the variation.",22,47,012-002-093-021-020-047,309

The rationale for the timeframes is as follows.,24,49,012-002-093-021-020-049,311
2015-07-14,Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-021-020,The Senior Minister of State for Education and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Currently, the OA can issue a certificate of discharge only after three years. We have retained this. The seven-year period was introduced because reviews show that further realisations are minimal after seven years for most bankruptcies; and in recent years, most bankrupts were discharged about eight years after being made bankrupt. So, between three years and seven years, to strike a balance and to incentivise bankrupts to keep up with their monthly contributions, we decided that they should be eligible to be discharged in five years. That is approximately two months to calculate the Target Contribution, 52 monthly contributions and six months to process the discharge. That comes up to 60 months – or five years.",25,50,012-002-093-021-020-050,312
2015-07-14,Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-021-020,The Senior Minister of State for Education and Law (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Ms Lim also asked about the number of repeat bankrupts and why they are subject to higher Target Contributions. Repeat bankrupts form under 4% of all bankrupts currently. So, it is really an exercise in balancing the interests of the people who have lent money, and the interests of the bankrupt. If it is too easy to get out of bankruptcy, then there will be a moral hazard – and society as a whole loses. The loss will also be on small creditors who will be less able to do the risk analysis, compared with larger creditors. Credit flow as a whole will be impacted. If a person who has been a bankrupt gets discharged and then becomes a bankrupt again, it is fair that he be held to stricter standards. The higher Target Contribution emphasises this. Nevertheless, the framework provides them with a chance to make a fresh start.",26,51,012-002-093-021-020-051,313

2015-07-14,Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-021-020,Ms Indranee Rajah,"  I believe we are talking about two separate issues. One, when I talked about setting the Target Contribution, when we look at the Target Contribution, you are really looking at the amounts that the debtor should repay. In calculating that, what is looked is at is the debtor's reasonable income or what he is likely to receive. So, the Target Contribution is set without reference to the private trustee's fees.",1,55,012-002-093-021-020-055,317

She is right that ordinarily, they will come from the bankrupts' estate. So, if there is anything left over, obviously, it would have to go the private trustee first. But in doing that, for small amounts, obviously, if the private trustees' fees are too large, then it is not going to be recoverable and that operates as a disincentive for creditors to go after bankrupts for smaller amounts. My answer was in context of the question of what happens when you have a relatively smaller amount and whether the debtor will bear a heavy burden in fees.",2,56,012-002-093-021-020-056,318
2015-07-14,Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill,012-002-093-021-020,Ms Indranee Rajah,"So, you can see that the way it is designed is intended to make the creditors sit down and think, ""Okay. This is how much the debt is. This is how much the debtor likely has in his estate. This is the amount of fees that the private trustees will have to be paid. If I appoint lawyers, there will be more fees as well. At the end of the day, is there anything left for me to recover?""

Singapore did not always enjoy the peace and prosperity that we do now. Our independence came suddenly. Our early years were fraught with bouts of unrest, driven by both internal and external forces. Encik Yusof, as our first President, played a key role to help restore trust and confidence amongst Singaporeans during this time that saw events that shook the nation, such as the 1964 racial riots.",14,15,012-002-093-021-022-015,359

His tireless visits to each constituency, and his countless outreaches to various racial and religious groups to share his vision and message, are testament to this. In his obituary speech to Encik Yusof Ishak, our Founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew described Encik Yusof as ""a deeply religious man, but who did not allow his religion to hinder his relationship with non-Muslims, whether they were Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, Confucians, or atheists"".

So, ISEAS is now in a very different position than when it was first set up way back in 1968. And this was not by chance. This was by very conscious effort and hard work over these many years.

I can assure you that if you are diligent in looking at how corporate governance works, there is almost a global consensus that Boards that are too big do not function effectively because the responsibilities get diluted and you may not necessarily get the right decision-makers.",4,162,012-002-093-021-022-162,506

As I said earlier on, I hope that, Ms Lim, you have heard me carefully, I said that much has changed in the last 50 years. And I think in whatever we do, we need to update provisions in the law to keep up with the changes. I explained at length how over the years, ISEAS had built up a very wide and deep network of relationships. What was done in the past where we needed various segments to support ISEAS' work, we now have many, many institutions and many, many groups who are in support of ISEAS' work.",1,180,012-002-093-021-022-180,524

We can always do it better, and what we are trying to do is to streamline the Board so that the Board can be more effective in discharging its duty.

I think, perhaps, Ms Lim under-estimates the amount of work that many statutory boards undertake to engage their stakeholders. Every Ministry, every statutory board, has multiple stakeholders. Every institute in our universities, every Polytechnic, ITE and so on, also have multiple stakeholders. Therefore, in that regard, ISEAS is not different from all the other statutory boards.

Does the Institute of Strategic Studies not have multiple stakeholders? They all do. So, I hope that Ms Lim would not throw up a red herring.",4,183,012-002-093-021-022-183,527

I would like to ask the Minister, as a matter of principle, is it not a contradiction when the effort to rename it to Encik Yusof Ishak institute - even though this is a good effort to honour a President – but at the same time, an effort is also made to change the powers of appointment from the President to the Minister?

Perhaps, Members of the Workers' Party would like to share their experience on some of these Boards, and if they can convince me that a big Board works effectively. Our experience has been that it needs a certain optimal size. Given the nature of the operations of ISEAS, we need an optimal Board size and we need to recognise that ISEAS has over the many years built up its relationship, many, many think tanks, research centres, stakeholders in Singapore, and so on and so forth.

For example, since 2011, MOE has worked closely with all SPED schools to implement the Direct Instruction (DI) Reading and Oral Language Programme to help students gain a stronger foundation in literacy. Another example is Pathlight School’s Literacy Remediation Programme (LRP) for their students with Autism Spectrum Disorder who are diagnosed with dyslexia or who are observed by their teachers to have reading challenges. Such customised literacy support programmes are offered at no additional cost to parents and are supported by Government’s per capita funding for SPED schools, which is substantially higher than that for mainstream schools as it takes into account the higher resourcing needs of SPED schools.",3,4,012-002-093-021-027-004,588

Singapore is participating actively in the preparatory conferences and related events of the COP-21. We have consistently tried to play the role of a constructive bridge-builder and have been invited to facilitate numerous discussions at past climate conferences.",3,4,012-002-093-021-034-004,618

We hope that our submission will encourage more countries, especially those in our region, to come forward with their pledges too. This is important because these pledges, taken over successive cycles, will form the centre piece of global mitigation efforts under the agreement. No single country can solve climate change alone - all countries have a part to play.",5,6,012-002-093-021-034-006,620
