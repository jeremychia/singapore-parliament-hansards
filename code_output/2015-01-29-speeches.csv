2015-01-29,Non-religious Entities Bidding for Developments Zoned for Places of Worship,012-002-093-003-001,Mr Khaw Boon Wan," Places of Worship, or PWs, serve the spiritual needs of our people and are essential community facilities. That is why the Master Plan has reserved and zoned specific land sites for PWs to be built. We tender out such sites to meet new demand and invite religious organisations to bid in such tenders. We have also opened such tenders to participation by companies. This is because some religious organisations form companies to enable and facilitate their ownership and development of such PW sites. This has been the practice since 1991 – that is some 24 years ago -- when State Lands were put up for tenders for PW use. The assumption is that only companies affiliated to religious organisations would participate in such tenders.",1,6,012-002-093-003-001-006,6

Since 1991, seven sites have been won by companies, all affiliated to religious organisations.",2,7,012-002-093-003-001-007,7
2015-01-29,Non-religious Entities Bidding for Developments Zoned for Places of Worship,012-002-093-003-001,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Until the recent case of the Chinese temple site in Sengkang, the Government has never awarded a PW site to a company that is not affiliated to a religious organisation. We now understand that the winning tenderer for this site, Eternal Pure Land Pte Ltd (EPL), is actually a private company without any religious affiliation. From what we know, the plan of the company is to run a commercial columbarium on the site. This is not in line with our plan for the PW site at Sengkang.",3,8,012-002-093-003-001-008,8

2015-01-29,Non-religious Entities Bidding for Developments Zoned for Places of Worship,012-002-093-003-001,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The intent of a Chinese temple was clearly stated in the Master Plan and the HDB's marketing brochures for their BTO flats there. Many temples provide an incidental columbarium service for their members and devotees. Whether the eventual temple in Sengkang will also provide such a service is a decision for the temple trustees to make. But to minimise disamenity to residents, there are clear URA planning guidelines for such ancillary facilities.",7,12,012-002-093-003-001-012,12
2015-01-29,Non-religious Entities Bidding for Developments Zoned for Places of Worship,012-002-093-003-001,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Late last year, we launched a review to improve our land tender process for places of worship, for example by tightening eligibility requirements for tenderers. We have been engaging religious groups on the review. The Sengkang temple case has highlighted the necessity for such a review. I will provide more information when the review is completed.",8,13,012-002-093-003-001-013,13

2015-01-29,Non-religious Entities Bidding for Developments Zoned for Places of Worship,012-002-093-003-001,Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.]  I would like to ask the Minister  in the past development of Singapore, what experiences have we learned in the building of temples, churches, mosques in residential areas? Many of our residents believe that if they live near to a temple or places of worship, they will be blessed. Guangming Shan has opened up to become a tourist site. In the case of Fo Guang Shan, they were able to be developed to provide both temple and columbarium services without any problems. Why is the development a problem?",2,15,012-002-093-003-001-015,15
2015-01-29,Non-religious Entities Bidding for Developments Zoned for Places of Worship,012-002-093-003-001,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"  Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for the questions. One take-away for me from this episode is that times have changed and some of our tender procedures have not caught up with time. For example, for over 20 years, we would never have thought that a for-profit company would participate in a non-profit making venture like building and owning a Chinese temple. In this instance, the motivations of the successful bidder are very different. But having reached such a situation, I will find a way to try and unwind this.",1,16,012-002-093-003-001-016,16
2015-01-29,Non-religious Entities Bidding for Developments Zoned for Places of Worship,012-002-093-003-001,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The key point is, for that Sengkang site, we want a Chinese temple; and we will deliver that. For that Sengkang site, we do not want a commercial columbarium; and we would not have one. Members can be re-assured about this point.",2,17,012-002-093-003-001-017,17
2015-01-29,Non-religious Entities Bidding for Developments Zoned for Places of Worship,012-002-093-003-001,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"As for reservation of PW sites, they are clearly marked in our Master Plan. Every five years, we review the Master Plan and when adjustments are needed, we publish those proposals and seek public consultation before we confirm them. So, there is full transparency. Likewise, HDB's BTO brochures are very clear. In this instance, for example, that the site would be reserved for a Chinese temple was clearly marked. There was no ambiguity about that. But I can understand some of the residents' unhappiness because of the possibility that there will be a commercial columbarium cropping up in their neighbourhood. I think those concerns are legitimate and reasonable.",3,18,012-002-093-003-001-018,18
2015-01-29,Non-religious Entities Bidding for Developments Zoned for Places of Worship,012-002-093-003-001,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"We make a strong distinction between a commercial columbarium and an incidental columbarium service which is provided by temple or church. I remember that in Er Dr Lee Bee Wah's constituency, there is a church which has an incidental columbarium service. As Mr Seng Han Thong pointed out, temples like Guangmin Shan (or Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery) and Fo Guang Shan also provide a columbarium service. I visit Fo Guang Shan occasionally, and I am impressed with their careful planning of the columbarium. Most temples hide them in the basement, so, it is dark and gloomy. But in this instance, they put it on Level 3 or 4. With sunlight coming in, it is bright and when you walk in, you do not feel uneasy about the columbarium.",4,19,012-002-093-003-001-019,19
2015-01-29,Non-religious Entities Bidding for Developments Zoned for Places of Worship,012-002-093-003-001,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"In other words, there are ways to provide a good columbarium service without causing any kind of disamenity.

2015-01-29,Non-religious Entities Bidding for Developments Zoned for Places of Worship,012-002-093-003-001,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"  Thank you, Mdm Speaker. It is not just the residents who are not happy. A lot of temples are not happy as well, since commercial companies were allowed to tender for the site. I would like to ask the Minister, since it is a commercial company which has the intention of setting up a columbarium, will the Ministry consider disqualifying this company, and re-call a tender. By allowing a commercial company to build a columbarium and later on bringing in a temple, the nature of the operations is very different from a temple itself, operating the place.",1,24,012-002-093-003-001-024,24

2015-01-29,Non-religious Entities Bidding for Developments Zoned for Places of Worship,012-002-093-003-001,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"  Mdm Speaker, as I had indicated, a review is on-going. In fact, the review has been going on for several months. There are different kinds of religious organisations – a church's needs and a temple's needs can be quite different. We have done many rounds of consultation and the consultation will continue to see how best to tighten some of these tender rules to achieve what our planning objectives are. If we want a temple, we really get a temple, and not a commercial columbarium cropping up out of the blue. The review is on-going.",1,26,012-002-093-003-001-026,26
2015-01-29,Non-religious Entities Bidding for Developments Zoned for Places of Worship,012-002-093-003-001,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The reason that triggers the review was not this incident in Sengkang. It was that we have got quite a bit of feedback from some of our temples and churches. When they take part in a tender, they often lose out to some other bidders whose congregation is much smaller and who already own an existing place of worship. So, they asked if the Government could build in additional criteria to ascertain needs rather than to simply award the tender to whoever has the deepest pocket. Often, the latter also has external links, being foreigners. And with deep pockets, they were more able to win the tender.",2,27,012-002-093-003-001-027,27

2015-01-29,Non-religious Entities Bidding for Developments Zoned for Places of Worship,012-002-093-003-001,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"In fact, some of us recall that the request to include commercial companies came from the religious organisations because some of them found it more convenient to do so. Because temples and churches are non-profit making, we just assume that profit-making companies would not be taking part in a non-profit making venture. That is how it came about.",2,31,012-002-093-003-001-031,31
2015-01-29,Non-religious Entities Bidding for Developments Zoned for Places of Worship,012-002-093-003-001,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Mr Seng Han Thong would know a very popular Chinese opera – Butterfly Lovers. It was in an era of old China when girls, unfortunately, were not allowed to join schools. But there was this young and beautiful talented lady, 祝英台, who wanted to study. So, she disguised herself as a boy, and succeeded in attending the school for three years. The classmates just assumed that girls would not turn up. In hindsight, they asked why they did not suspect. They had noticed that the student looked a little girlish, but just brushed the thought aside as it would be too incredible. And ""he"" turned out to be a girl.",3,32,012-002-093-003-001-032,32
2015-01-29,Non-religious Entities Bidding for Developments Zoned for Places of Worship,012-002-093-003-001,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"It is a similar situation here. The officials assessing the tender assumed that it must be a company affiliated to some religious organisation. Because they made the highest bid, it was awarded to them. But as I have said, we will find a way to forge a middle path forward. The key point is we will restore the planning objective.",4,33,012-002-093-003-001-033,33

For instance, in the event of a fire or smoke in the MRT tunnel, the operators will have to alert SCDF immediately and route affected trains to the nearest station, away from the source of the fire or smoke. If passengers have to detrain onto the tracks, the operators are required to activate the tunnel lights and ventilation system to provide a safe evacuation path.",3,4,012-002-093-003-002-004,45

Yes, it is true that the monorail system, Sentosa Express, follows the stringent requirements of the Japanese monorail system, which is not just used in Japan, but also in China and some Middle Eastern countries. With the OEM's recommended maintenance schedule and parts replacement, SLM working with SMRT carried out those inspections. Some of them are daily; some of them are weekly; others are at the longer intervals.

For the monorail to run, there is a swinging arm on the monorail and there is a power line that is semi-embedded along the track to supply the power. This arm will have to be in contact with the power line in order to tap on power for it to move. As soon as there is no contact, the train will stop. Unfortunately, in this case, at one end of the terminal, at the Beach Station, the power line has lost some tensile strength. Over a period or a long time of use, the power line can be slightly dislodged, and that was what happened. So, when the train moved off, it entangled the power line and started to cause damages on both sides.",2,8,012-002-093-003-003-008,55

The passengers were safe; there was no fire. The train was made of non-combustible materials, both internally as well as the structure. A series of recovery actions started. The first thing that the train company SLM did was to send a rescue train to come in and bring the passengers away. Within the next hour, all passengers had moved on to the rescue train.",3,9,012-002-093-003-003-009,56

After they transferred all the passengers to the rescue train, because it was on a slope, the new train could not have power to decouple from the stuck train, to move on. A week later, there was a series of enactment and study, and they figured that if they had increased enough power, the train could have actually moved off.

Patent protection in each country is granted by its patent office, and most countries adopt the internationally recognised criteria of novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability to ascertain whether a patent should be granted. Each patent office conducts its own search and examination. The determination of whether an invention meets the criteria for obtaining a patent depends very much on the relevant body of knowledge and technology that the examiner is able to find in the public domain within the time available and his evaluation of the information found.",2,17,012-002-093-003-006-017,112

As I mentioned earlier, each patent office will do its own search and examination. It will look at the criteria of novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability and ascertain whether, on the face of it, the patent can be granted. I should say, however, that all patents that are granted are potentially open to challenges by other parties. The grant of a patent does not guarantee that the patent will never be successfully challenged in Court since the patent office grants patents without the benefit of hearing arguments by other parties as to why a patent should not be granted. Recognising that it is not possible for a patent examiner to be aware of all the relevant body of knowledge and technology that is publicly available worldwide, patent systems in the world generally allow for the validity of patents which have been granted to be contested, and Singapore is no exception.",4,19,012-002-093-003-006-019,114

2015-01-29,Allowing Middle-income Workers above Age 50 to Increase CPF Contributions to Reduce Tax Liability,012-002-093-003-007,The Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin),"  Mdm Speaker, our objective is to ensure good employability for all Singaporeans. The CPF contribution rates for older workers above 50 were lowered in the past to do precisely that and, basically, to enhance employability for older workers. Why is that so? Seniority-based wage systems were common then, which discouraged employers from retaining and hiring older workers. The employment rates of older workers have since improved considerably although, by and large, when you compare older workers with younger workers, the employability of younger workers is generally higher than the older workers themselves. Good progress has also been made by tripartite partners in wage restructuring and other efforts to help them be employed and also to stay employed.",1,2,012-002-093-003-007-002,118

The increase in contribution rates has been phased in gradually to moderate the impact on business costs and take-home pay of the employees. Since September 2012, we have twice increased the CPF contribution rates for older workers aged 50 to 65, with the latest increase effective from 1 January this year. In particular, the CPF contribution rate for workers aged 50 to 55 has been raised by five percentage points since 2012, and is now two percentage points lower than for workers below the age of 50.

2015-01-29,Quality Jobs for Increasing Number of Graduates,012-002-093-003-013,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),"  Mdm Speaker, the Government adopts a two-pronged approach in its efforts to help our university graduates get good jobs. First, we keep our economy competitive and seek to capitalise on new opportunities in and beyond our region. We do this by growing knowledge-intensive industries that will provide good jobs, and also by pursuing sustained, productivity-driven growth in key sectors of our economy such as manufacturing, financial and business services. This allows our economy to grow amidst a challenging global environment and to create higher-skilled jobs for Singaporeans.",1,2,012-002-093-003-013-002,192

2015-01-29,Quality Jobs for Increasing Number of Graduates,012-002-093-003-013,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),"Let me illustrate how this strategy is implemented in manufacturing. As we all know, manufacturing remains a vital part of our economy, providing more than half a million jobs while contributing about a fifth of our GDP. To build up our industry capabilities in advanced manufacturing, we are helping businesses to adopt and leverage on new technologies in areas such as Additive Manufacturing and Robotics. This will transform the way our companies operate to create new growth and business opportunities, as well as diverse jobs that provide good career development potential for Singaporean graduates. These jobs will require deep skills and multi-disciplinary knowledge, and the ability to synthesise the two. One example is a manufacturing operations design specialist, someone who needs to be able to design the manufacturing process for new products, rather than just implement an existing procedure.",3,4,012-002-093-003-013-004,194

2015-01-29,Quality Jobs for Increasing Number of Graduates,012-002-093-003-013,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),"The second prong of our approach is to invest heavily in equipping Singaporeans with the skills to take on the jobs that we are creating. MTI works with MOE and MOM to identify the current and future skill-sets required and design education and training programmes to equip Singaporeans with these skills. For example, our Institutes of Higher Learning have industry engagement platforms to ensure that their curricula and learning outcomes are mapped closely to the skills and capabilities required by industry. The SkillsFuture Council will also work with industry partners to develop Sectoral Manpower Strategies to identify future skills, and set out strategies for developing these skills in our workforce.",5,6,012-002-093-003-013-006,196

We will continue to keep our economy competitive by pushing on with restructuring and our efforts to create good jobs.

2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Another example is that of patients requesting for complex scans when the need is not supported by medical evidence, or asking for the newest procedure when older ones are measurably more effective, more reliable and more affordable. This is as much a challenge of public perception as anything else, but it is a reality and it will, nonetheless, continue to put pressure on healthcare providers and subsequently upward pressure on medical costs.",12,75,012-002-093-003-015-075,285
2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"Hence, I hope that the Minister could clarify a little bit further -- I know he has already done so -- on the roles and functions of the MediShield Life Council, as defined in clause 8 of the Bill. I understand that the Council will advise the Ministry on the parameters of coverage, and I hope that there will be robust mechanisms to evaluate what treatments are deserving of coverage, regardless of how much it cost. This ability to determine which treatment is allowed under the Scheme is already stipulated, as I note under clause 34(c) of the Bill.",13,76,012-002-093-003-015-076,286
2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar),"What I am advocating is that whether a treatment is covered by the Scheme should be based on scientific merit, and if this treatment is actually effective then the Scheme should endeavour to cover it, regardless of the cost. The strong safeguards that we need are necessary to guard against this moral hazard of over-consumption, whether it is from the demand side by patients, or from the supply side by healthcare providers.",14,77,012-002-093-003-015-077,287

I do know of many elderly residents, most of whom are Pioneers, who have never been covered under any medical insurance scheme and also have incomplete medical records. These residents or these citizens may sometimes encounter challenges going for a thorough medical review. I would like to seek clarification that these citizens can be automatically included in the scheme with the assumption that they have no pre-existing illnesses.",15,78,012-002-093-003-015-078,288

While improvements in coverage for outpatient cancer treatment and also for kidney dialysis are very welcome indeed, various aspects of intermediate and long-term care still face challenges in financing. As raised on previous occasions, our ElderShield system is still limited in its benefits in terms of its scope and schedule, and I hope that the Ministry will continue to look into these areas, beyond MediShield Life, since there is a continuum of care from the hospital all the way back to the community.",16,79,012-002-093-003-015-079,289

But what it is about is to afford us peace of mind so that even as we take positive steps to safeguard our health, should a medical catastrophe strike us or our loved ones, then we can be assured that we will have the medical treatment that we need, regardless of our circumstances, young or old.

I had also described MediShield Life as a bold scheme and cautioned about the need to ensure its sustainability, given the significant and permanent financial commitments by both Singaporeans and the Government. Experiences by other countries such as Canada, US, Europe, Australia and Taiwan offered invaluable lessons on how the government's strong fiscal positions and people's conscientious premium contributions are important in sustaining a universal public health insurance scheme. Such a scheme brings great social good but if it cannot be sustained, then it will be a shame.",2,82,012-002-093-003-015-082,292

At first glance, the penalties appear harsh and some may even interpret it as the Government being gian lui (greedy for money). However, I do think otherwise as I believe it is just as important to put in place a mechanism to ensure that financially capable policyholders play their role and contribute. It is important for Singaporeans to pool our risks and take care of each other collectively. All Singaporeans contributing to the pool is a tangible action and demonstration of our strong sense of national solidarity and willingness to help our fellow countrymen. It is, to me, a test of our conviction towards building a caring and inclusive society. Therefore, while the Government should and can take on a large share of the healthcare financial burden, all of us still have a role to play. It is in this spirit that I agree to the need for penalties to be imposed on wilful recalcitrant defaulters and I stress ""wilful recalcitrant defaulters"".",4,84,012-002-093-003-015-084,294

Hence, they may inadvertently have missed the premium payment notices sent to them. As such, I would like to ask the Minister how will MOH identify and decide if someone is a wilful defaulter? What parameters, specifically, will be used to define a wilful defaulter? If the member delays the payment beyond 90 days but shows reasonable effort to pay once he or she can, will the MOH give him or her, a second chance? While it is important to ensure that wilful defaulters do their part, I am also cognisant of the need to avoid penalties on Singaporeans who just need a little more time.

This subsidy, together with the special premium subsidy under the Package, can fully pay for their annual MediShield Life premium until they are 83. This means that for quite a number of years, they do not have to pay anything out of their own pocket. But when they reach 83, they will suddenly find the need to pay for the additional premiums on their own, which can cause confusion. Besides, retirees will have less Medisave savings and cash as they get older. Some of them may have already exhausted their Medisave. I would like to ask the following questions ",9,89,012-002-093-003-015-089,299

Second, for these Pioneers who have financial difficulties, will the Government automatically give them additional subsidies so that they can continue to be insured and will not be worried about getting a ‘red slip'? This also applies to the Pioneers who are slightly younger than this age group and who may face a similar situation. Third, will the Government consider allowing this group of Pioneers, namely those aged between 75 and 79 last year, to be exempted from paying premiums altogether. After all, the difference between their Medisave subsidies and the premiums they have to pay is about $12 to $15 only.",10,90,012-002-093-003-015-090,300

In the past, MediShield does not cover those with pre-existing medical conditions whether they are born with it, or acquired it later in life. In the past, about one in four in the Pioneer Generation were not covered under MediShield because they cannot work, or cannot be reached or may have opted out.

With a new-found confidence by members that coverage is now for all and for life with no cap to life-time claim limits whatsoever, the potential of higher and over-consumption is real.

We did not debate on whether the Bill goes too far. This is quite noteworthy. In many parts of the world, the idea of a mandatory, compulsory or universal healthcare care financing framework brings out the worst possible rhetoric and posturing from the political right, with accusations of welfarism and socialism. In the United States, the debate over the Affordable Care Act was particularly heated in this respect. On the other hand, in a place like the United Kingdom, where there are proposals to introduce market and insurance mechanisms to the NHS, have also drawn accusations about heartless capitalism from the left. Here, in Singapore, in debating and discussing the changes to MediShield that take it to the next level, MediShield Life, this has not been the issue. We take it as read that we can use insurance, co-payments, and other tools of the market to achieve what is essentially a fairly socialist aim, that is, the provision by the State of accessible, affordable healthcare for all. The Government is not being attacked for a welfarist or socialist position, quite the opposite, there are many calls to do more, provide more help, reduce the financial burden even further. And the response has not been one of ideology, but rather the practical reality – everything we do has to be sustainable, we must not burden our children of tomorrow with the bill from the political promises of today. We have moved past ideology, and that is something to appreciate, to be grateful for, and to preserve.",1,157,012-002-093-003-015-157,367

There have been questions about the sustainability and financial viability of the scheme. These have been discussed, debated and answered, but, in truth, we will always need to keep a close eye on this, as health and healthcare expenditures are very unpredictable.

2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"My first is about the process of a Singaporean opting-out of the information discovery, that can either be the healthcare issues, or their means and wealth. This comes with a cost, as discussed, of the citizen having to bear a higher premium. My question is about the process of opting back in again. How often will this opportunity be available? On a yearly basis? On a rolling basis? Is there a minimum time period for which the citizen will have to pay the higher premium? When the citizen opts in again, it is appropriate that the administrators of the scheme will need to have access to healthcare data from the period during which the citizen had opted out, so that the risks of possible pre-existing conditions can be assessed properly. However, would the income, wealth and means data from the time period that the Singaporean had opted out of means-testing, be then available and be scrutinised when they opt back in again? I assume that there is only a need for the scheme to assess the citizen's means at that point in time, but could the Minister please clarify this?",4,160,012-002-093-003-015-160,370
2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Next, if I may draw your attention to clause 16, where significant powers of enforcement are granted to deal with defaulters from the scheme should they wish to leave Singapore. Essentially, this is to ensure that the scheme is truly universal and mandatory. I would like to contrast this with the situation of a non-Singaporean, who is struck by an unforeseen catastrophic illness and racks up a large bill at one of our public healthcare institutions, a bill they may not be able to pay. I realise that the comparison is not entirely appropriate as on the one hand, you have a national insurance scheme, and on the other hand, you have an operational cost recovery problem for the specific hospital. But if that bill remains unpaid, becomes a bad debt, as occasionally happens, this will affect the costs for our healthcare system, as the Minister has described, and lead to an increase of healthcare costs in general, and so, eventually, have an effect on the premiums.",5,161,012-002-093-003-015-161,371
2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Philosophically, from the issue of social responsibility, there is also the issue that we are mandating an appropriate financial burden to provide the healthcare insurance coverage for Singaporeans, without making the same requirement on non-Singaporeans who may utilise our healthcare infrastructure. In general, this will not be an issue and most will pay their unsubsidised bills in full and on time. But where unfortunate circumstances overtake these non-Singaporeans, they may not be able to pay, even if they intend to. In particular, I am concerned about the non-Singaporean dependants, for example, children and grandparents, who will not be covered by the employer of the primary pass holder. For the purposes of protecting the finances of our public institutions and in order to achieve parity with the requirement placed on Singaporeans, I would like to suggest that MOH consider mandating healthcare insurance for non-Singaporeans that are here for a prolonged period of time. This would not fall under the remit of MediShield Life, and so should not affect the risk pooling. It should be an entirely commercial insurance product, with no risk to the public finances, and it need not be comprehensive in terms of healthcare coverage. Essentially, there are two minimum options, either coverage for catastrophic large hospital bills, over a certain threshold, or to cover the repatriation of the person to their home country.

At the frontline of public healthcare, we must still continue to provide help, care and treatment as needed, as soon as presented with a patient, as we have done. We should continue to allow non-Singaporeans to visit us and to utilise our excellent healthcare services, because that is the morally correct and human thing to do. But we should help to ensure that they can deal with the costs should something unforeseen and unfortunate happen, and that this should not be a burden on the finances of the Singaporean public institutions and finally to ensure that there are no loopholes for abuse.",7,163,012-002-093-003-015-163,373

The universality of the MediShield Life scheme and the attendant risk-pooling means that the problems of smokers are now all our problems. The impact of smoking related diseases will increase the premiums for all Singaporeans, unless we continue to act to help people stop smoking. I applaud MOH and HPB and many other institutions for the hard work they do in this area, but more needs to be done, and I fear it will be many years before we can see the last case of smoking induced cancer.",9,165,012-002-093-003-015-165,375
2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I have a suggestion. It would not be my first choice, but if we cannot achieve a tobacco-free generation through a legislative mandate, how about using the economics of MediShield Life to help drive the right behaviour? Specifically, if a person should be discharged, not admitted – you do not know what is happening to you when you are admitted – from a public hospital with a smoking related disease; thereafter, for all costs related to the same disease, should he not have to pay a larger proportion of the bill if he is still smoking? And how might we know that if he is still a smoker? There is a very simple test, called the urinary cotinine, using a urine dipstick to test for a substance that is a by-product of tobacco, which remains in the body for a week after smoking. If the individual's urine is positive, how about they are required to pay a larger portion of the bill? If we do not have a mechanism like this, the true cost of that person's smoking is passed on to all Singaporeans as a result of increased healthcare expenditure. This method that I have suggested would not affect the premiums paid, nor would it deny a citizen access to healthcare. It would not affect the charges for healthcare prior to the first diagnosis of a smoking related disease. But having been admitted for smoking related diseases, this becomes a very powerful incentive to quit and if you are far-sighted enough, of course quit long before you have a smoking related disease. We have considered discounts, penalties, rewards and rebates as a means to shift behaviour in many other spheres of life, from purchasing goods and using power to parking. Why not use it as a mechanism to encourage people to give up smoking?",10,166,012-002-093-003-015-166,376

They will enjoy a public healthcare system that is robust, effective and sustainable. They will not believe there was ever a time when this was not available. They will not believe that there ever was such a thing as an exclusion criterion. The idea of being ""uninsurable"" will be unfamiliar to them. They will assume that universal healthcare coverage for life is the natural way such things should be done and they will not understand the anxiety their parents and grandparents had about growing old and not being able to afford healthcare. It is only good and right that we can remove this fear, calm this anxiety, and provide all Singaporeans the healthcare that they need. Madam, I support the Bill.",11,167,012-002-093-003-015-167,377

These are the people who may not have donees, who may not have court-appointed deputies and who are above 21 years old. How will the Government ensure that premiums are paid? It would be onerous to require them to make an application to court or to require their care-givers to make an application to court just so that premiums can be paid.

Can the Minister clarify the application of the amended subsections to the MediShield Life Scheme?

I also, however, want to request the Minister to consider including additional criteria apart from income and household house value in assessing whether or not an insured person qualifies for Premium Subsidies.

We can do more to help those with mental problems requiring long-term treatment. I am heartened to note that this Bill will cover hospitalisation expenses incurred from treatment of pre-existing mental illnesses. However, many mental diseases do not require hospitalisation. Instead, the patients do require follow-up consultations and will take prescriptive medicines, often on a long-term basis. This can come up to quite a tidy sum especially for a normal family. The cost of treatment will discourage one to continue treatment, which can lead to very serious consequences. Therefore, I urge the Government to provide improved protection for this group of patients and their families.",14,271,012-002-093-003-015-271,481
2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Nee Soon),"The third part of it is preventive healthcare. Prevention is always better than cure. It is often emphasised that we should take personal responsibility to take care of one's health which is the best ways to keep healthcare affordable. Getting Singaporeans to go for health screenings has always been a challenge, more so for the low-income groups who would consider health screenings as an unnecessary expense or a luxury. If health screenings for common diseases could be covered under the scheme, more will be inclined to go for regular health check-ups. In turn, this could lead to reducing the demands on our health services. Besides, if one is diagnosed early the recovery rate improves and the person will have a better chance of recovery and continue to be economically productive.",15,272,012-002-093-003-015-272,482

In Germany, people who have statutory health insurance have access to selected types of screenings for free at a specific frequency when they are of a certain age group. These tests include general check-ups, skin cancer screening, cervical cancer screening, mammography, endoscopy of the bowel and so-forth, to identify commonly diagnosed cancers in the country.

Yet these are often not given the due care until it is too late. They are also avenues where symptoms and signs of more serious health implications might be identified. While other countries typically do not offer coverage under their national health insurance schemes, under the National Health Service (NHS) in England, the vulnerable and low income groups do get access to free dental care as well as eye tests.",17,274,012-002-093-003-015-274,484

It is a bit restrictive in terms of coverage, but I do hope that more can be done to expand the variety of conditions that can be covered. Nevertheless, for the affordable annual premium supplemented by financial assistance for those who need it, it is a comprehensive plan that offers decent life-long protection for the majority. The healthcare systems in Western and Northern Europe are often envied as many components are available to the beneficiaries for free.

And they were saying that now, with this MediShield Life, they have pre-existing illness. When they bought the previous insurance, they were healthy. So their concern is on the loading of the premiums. So, perhaps, this is something that I hope the Ministry can address. The next concern are those retirees. I met a lot of the retirees in the coffeeshop, almost every morning. They are sitting down there limp kopi (drinking coffee) and in the evening, perhaps one or two bottles of beer. They never think of buying health insurance and to them, they never think beyond what is tomorrow. So they just enjoy their simple life. And they say that now we make it compulsory, they will have to find money to pay the premium and they are very worried about the jail term when they do not pay the premium. So these are the two main points that my residents have been bringing up to me.

As we know, when a marriage or a relationship is bliss, couples, husbands, wives, and even children will happily set up joint account, joint ownership from bank accounts to all types of properties. But not every joint account is a true joint account in the sense that both are contributing financially equally. We have seen in many divorce cases, for example, where a spouse would complain that the husband or wife never contributed financially to whatever purchases – movable and immovable. So if we just follow the spirit of the legal definition of joint account, then the innocent party would be penalised unfairly.",5,316,012-002-093-003-015-316,526

There are medical clinics where patients are asked to pay from $30-$50 or more for medical reports to support insurance claims. These are not reports that a doctor has to generate specially for the patient, but they are reports that are already in the patient's file, for example, blood test result, biopsy result, etc. All they need is to make photocopies and perhaps sign off.

The annual premiums can range from only $130 for those who are young to as much as $1,530 for those who are older than 90, and, although there are Additional Premium Support and various subsidies available for the less well-off, there is still likelihood for some of these needy folk to default on premium payments. They, especially the older people with high premiums to pay, will then fall through the cracks of the Scheme. The Ministry of Health (MOH) must spare no effort at assisting them in such instances. Those with depleted Medisave balances in spite of Government Top-ups are vulnerable. This group may have exhausted their Medisave due to their multiple medical needs either through private clinics or Government hospitals.

If so, would MOH not consider this is unfair to the others considering that these residents may choose to truly reside permanently here in their later lives when their need for medical care will be greater. They will have full use of the MediShield Life Scheme without having to pay premiums that were normally due.",3,323,012-002-093-003-015-323,533
2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,Dr Lily Neo (Tanjong Pagar),"Mdm Speaker, it is likely that the majority of Singaporeans will not require intense use of hospitals or claim the use of MediShield when they are younger and usually healthier. The prevalence of chronic conditions and the incidence of serious illnesses rise with advancing age resulting in more frequent need of inpatient hospital services and care. This is especially true in the last few years of life when a final illness very often requires one or more hospital stay. This is the period when the cost of medical care will be at its highest and it is for this eventuality that people take up health insurance. It seems that non-premium-paying PRs residing overseas will be taxing our system if they choose to come back when their medical needs are at the highest. In fact, this Bill may encourage them to do so because, after all, we do have a high standard of medical care and, of course, with this Bill, we also have this MediShield Life Scheme. Since MediShield Life is a universal policy, there should not be preferential treatment for PRs with premium-paying exemptions. It would be better to give the non-resident PRs the choice to be in the MediShield Life Scheme or to withdraw from it completely. If they withdraw and not be paying the premiums anymore, they cannot expect to be covered under MediShield Life ever.",4,324,012-002-093-003-015-324,534

Individuals convicted of such offences may face up to $5,000 fine or 12 months' imprisonment or both, and additionally be required to pay penalties pegged to the amount of premiums undercharged or benefits or claims overpaid. Madam, my concern is for those who may have omitted in declaring due to the lapses in memory or lack of information. For instance, he or she may have had a ""minor"" operation for a ""non-serious then"" condition 10 or even 15 years earlier, which he or she had forgotten. There are also situations when patients were shielded from real diagnosis of their diseases, especially cancer, from their loved ones and leaving them unaware of their own conditions. They would have then declared incorrectly rather than trying to withhold medical information.",5,325,012-002-093-003-015-325,535

This Bill gives CPF Board the power to access medical records of patients, presumably, from health records of Government institutions. What about those who do not visit Government hospitals and may have medical records only with private hospitals or hospitals overseas? Even for those with local medical records, the records may not be comprehensive enough to capture all their conditions especially when they have multiple medical illnesses being treated by various and multiple doctors. In this respect, what scheme is in place to ensure the capture of relevant medical records?

May I ask the Minister how far is the planning for this MediShield Life? Will it be good for at least two or three generations of Singaporeans? Although the Government is putting in $4 billion into the scheme presently, we cannot expect this subsidy to be perpetual as it has to depend on good economic growth. Therefore, will MediShield Life be robust enough, taking into consideration our fast ageing population, for the future when we will have exponential risks for medical care? Has MOH done any postulations to chart the sustainability of MediShield Life with the ever increasing expectations of our people and the increasing availability and costs of new medical technologies? Should not some basic tenets be in place from the beginning to address these concerns on sustainability of MediShield Life?

Over time, there will be refinements to the scheme, premiums will be adjusted. Public education, hence, must be on-going, continuous and as in advertising jargon, ""as sticky as possible"".

The Government provides every Singaporean newborn with a Medisave grant of $3,000 which can be used to pay for his premiums. Using the MediShield Life premium for high income in 2019, the total premiums from birth to age 21 would be $2,795. Most likely the amount would be higher as premiums would likely increase over the next 21 years. This amount will almost exhaust the $3,000 Government grant at age 21, provided that the grant is not already utilised for other medical expenses.",5,333,012-002-093-003-015-333,543

However, a 61-year old PG member already has to pay an additional $289 on their annual Medisave top-up of $200 for the $489 subsidised annual premium.

I would like to explain that the MediShield Life Review Committee had made their recommendation on this issue only after serious and in-depth consideration of the extensive feedback from members of the public. The Additional Premiums strike a balance between reflecting the higher risks of those with pre-existing conditions, while at the same time avoiding placing too much financial burden on them.

For example, under MediShield Life, serious pre-existing conditions that may be subjected to Additional Premiums include stroke, cancer, kidney failure and heart diseases, just to name a few. Today, Singaporeans with these conditions will not even be accepted for coverage by a private insurer. On the other hand, less severe conditions such as pre-cancer, well-managed hypertension and diabetes with no complication, will not be subjected to Additional Premiums as they generally have no long-term treatment impact.",16,388,012-002-093-003-015-388,598

These databases include the ones used to process various types of claims submitted by both private and public medical institutions.

An IP is made up of two parts – the MediShield component, run by CPF Board, and the top-up component, run by private insurers. The top-up component provides the additional benefits and coverage (for example, for Class B1, A and private hospitals hospitalisation). There is no duplication between MediShield and the IP top-up components today. You do not need to pay double.

And if the exemption is granted, can the person who has applied for this exemption plead for reinstatement into the scheme and when will this be made possible?",12,416,012-002-093-003-015-416,626

2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"MediShield Life is different. It is a lifeboat, with all Singaporeans on board. There are no separate accounts. Everyone contributes and everyone benefits. For the lower income, middle income and the Pioneer Generation and pensioners, the Government pays the premium, partially or even entirely. And for all of us, there are Transitional Subsidies. Some will of course benefit more than others. The elderly, those who are less well-off and those who incur higher medical costs may receive more than they contribute. But that is perfectly acceptable, because when it comes to healthcare, those who are more able should help others. We are in this together, and it is not about who benefits more. I therefore fully support the principle of including every Singaporean in the Scheme, including those living abroad and those who may not require to be in on the Scheme. I likewise support having an effective and efficient system of ensuring that everyone contributes his or her share to the common pool does so and I hope the exemptions and exceptions will be few.",3,437,012-002-093-003-015-437,647

It is unclear who these ""other persons"" are. So, the Rules will prescribe who ""these persons"" are and the circumstances which one's Medisave account will be debited to pay for the premiums for these ""other persons"". May I ask who these ""other persons"" are, and who will be asked to pay? Further, will a person be entitled to object to such a deduction, and if so, on what grounds?",5,439,012-002-093-003-015-439,649

Still, we should ensure that defaulters are not treated in an unduly harsh manner. I think that is the likely intention behind section 11 which provides that a demand note must first be served on the defaulter before further enforcement actions can be taken. However, it is not clear how much time a defaulter will have to remedy the situation. This can be contrasted with section 87 of the Income Tax Act, which states that if payment is not made within one month from the date of service of the demand note, the Comptroller may proceed to enforce payment.

My concern is that this may not be a cost effective way of recovering premiums. Given that monthly premiums will in most cases run into double digits, the outstanding premiums are not likely to be large, even if outstanding for some time. There is a real possibility that the cost of bringing proceedings will far exceed the sum owed.",7,441,012-002-093-003-015-441,651

In the case of MediShield Life, the worry is that people will seek, and doctors will prescribe, unnecessary treatment and medication. In particular, where doctors or medical centres profit from the sale of medicine or from procedures, there is every incentive to over-prescribe or prescribe more expensive procedures and medicines. There will also the need to administer this entire Scheme, that means more bureaucracy, more red tape and ultimately, more costs. Not only will this deplete the pool of funds, resources will be diverted from those who truly need them.

Since this House unanimously supported the MediShield Life Review Committee's recommendations in July last year, the Ministry has stepped up its efforts to share with Singaporeans the benefits of MediShield Life. Through these outreach efforts, we learnt that getting Singaporeans to understand MediShield Life is not simple, because most of us do not think about hospital bills, or health insurance, until the day we fall ill.",3,467,012-002-093-003-015-467,677
2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"We also learnt that using only the mass media to spread the word is not enough. The communications challenge is quite daunting. We have had to reach out through a mix of platforms, channels and languages, each with different tailored messages. Besides print, radio, TV and social media platforms, we also shared on MediShield Life at the People's Association's and Agency for Integrated Care's (AIC) grassroots events and dialogue sessions. Thus far, we organised or participated in more than 35 dialogues and community events reaching out to more than 7,000 residents just through the grassroots events. Some of the common concerns raised during these sessions were the affordability of MediShield Life premiums and rising healthcare costs over time; misunderstandings about duplication between MediShield Life and private insurance; the mandatory nature of MediShield Life and duplication of coverage between MediShield Life and pensions benefits or other employer-provided healthcare insurance.",4,468,012-002-093-003-015-468,678

2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"While Singaporeans understand that MediShield Life offers better benefits than the current MediShield, some have asked whether they will benefit from MediShield Life if they have already bought a private Integrated Shield Plan. As Minister of State Dr Lam had noted earlier, some even have the mistaken view that they will have to pay for two policies – their Integrated Shield Plans (IPs) and MediShield Life. This is clearly not the case and I think it is a point that bears repeating.",7,471,012-002-093-003-015-471,681
2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"So, let me try to explain it again in this way  MediShield as it is today forms the Foundation of all Integrated Shield Plans (IPs), and the IPs, the enhanced portion, ride on this foundation to provide additional coverage targeting the Class B1/A wards or private hospitals. When MediShield Life is launched, it will become the new Foundation. So, MediShield Life plus the top-up portion forms one Integrated Plan and a single premium is paid. To use everyday language, MediShield Life is like plain Milo, which is tasty enough for most people. IPs are like Milo Dinosaur or Milo Godzilla, which tastes even richer than Milo, but will definitely cost more.",8,472,012-002-093-003-015-472,682

In their report, the MediShield Life Review Committee (MLRC) also recommended that the process of applying for subsidies should be simple and convenient, so that eligible Singaporeans and PRs can access these subsidies easily.

The first key step is to work out ""estimated households"", by grouping those with the same NRIC address as part of the same household, and excluding any tenants that have been declared to HDB.

As per my previous speech during the debate on MediShield Life, this Scheme is not just about dollars and cents, but it is about our people and it is also about our social ethos.

2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"There are three features of the scheme that stands out. The first is that it is automatic. Everyone is automatically included - no additional paper will be required. In other words, no Singaporean or PR is left behind because they are ill-informed, illiterate or poor. By doing so, the increased risk pooling and risk protection, along with adequate social protection mechanisms like financial assistance that target subsidies to low-income and disadvantaged will ensure that no one is left behind.",5,506,012-002-093-003-015-506,716
2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"Two, it is universal. Universal coverage should be lauded. I hear Minister of State Dr Lam and Senior Minister of State Dr Khor's explanations about the lien of sub-standard life, but I would like to appeal for more information in greater compassion. Many people with pre-existing illnesses tend to be from an older age group, and because they cannot work full-time, many are also from the lower income group living in smaller or rental flats. The 30% lien for 10 years can be a burden for them. In the spirit of mutual help, may I ask the Ministry how much would this cost per insured, if spread amongst the entire risk pool, or if absorbed by the Government? I think we can be more compassionate in this instance.",6,507,012-002-093-003-015-507,717
2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"The third feature is that there are lower out-of-pocket expenses. Sudden bad health gives no notice. Hence, the shift financing from post-payment to pre-funding and pre-payment will ensure that people do not need to worry about treatment and financing simultaneously, which can be disastrous. Many of our hardy Pioneers and elderly hid their bodily pains and health conditions from their children, and refused treatment because they do not want to burden their family. This is not right. Our elderly have contributed to Singapore and deserve the best care in their old age. We need to take care of them. With MediShield Life and pre-payment, financial barriers are reduced. They will receive proper treatment while the ethos of saving for a rainy day is also being reinforced.",7,508,012-002-093-003-015-508,718
2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"But there still remains quite a number of questions on people's minds, in particular, the long-term sustainability of the scheme. How do we cope with the rapid technological advancement that escalates costs of detection and early treatment? What happens when someone defaults on the payment? I hear some of the assurances given by the Minister of State but what are definitive criteria and system in place to ensure that premiums are collected and we weed out the irresponsible and free riders? How do we ensure, at the same time, that the needy are objectively and adequately taken care of? And, in addition, how much premiums will we have to pay over a lifetime? Is the amount in Medisave sufficient to cover these premiums? Is there a ""minimum sum"" we need to set aside by retirement age to ensure that we have enough to cover premiums during our retirement? Otherwise, is there a risk that we may use up our Medisave on deductibles/ outpatient/ Integrated Shield Plans and so on, thereby leaving insufficient funds for MediShield premiums in retirement or even before retirement?",8,509,012-002-093-003-015-509,719
2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"I think more information on the overall costs and financing should be made available, so that the man on the street understands the impact of health financing in their lifetime and the need to save more for the long term. Perhaps, MOH can help to improve financial literacy on health costs, help people to understand what is covered, what they need to be responsible for, and what options they have to supplement their coverage, and how the healthcare system is funded, for example, how many percentage is funded from taxes, from MediShield, from Medisave, so that there is transparency and sufficient knowledge to help people to budget and plan.",9,510,012-002-093-003-015-510,720

Cash top-ups and contributions to siblings, parents, grandparents and children's Medisave account should be made tax-deductible, and this should be allowed for multiple account contributors simultaneously, and obviously also up to a certain ceiling.

I think any system, no matter how well-designed, will falter unless it is well communicated. Despite the advertisements and Government announcement, many are still unclear about what MediShield Life covers, and some even question if they would ever use it. There is an urgent need for effective public communication to explain the nature and benefits of MediShield Life. I hear Senior Minister of State Dr Khor's assurance about roadshows and the various publicity plans that are in place. I am heartened by that, but at the same time, I am going to suggest that perhaps, we could also try cloud sourcing video clips made by those who are concerned with it and those who has got some video or story-telling abilities so that on one hand, they learn about it with their team and on the other hand, they are able to produce short watchable clips that will educate the public. And perhaps also set up interactive websites that feature case studies and financial calculators as well as brochures and leaflets that can be made available at public places like shopping centres, hawker centres, community clubs, clinics and hospitals. The truth is that for many people, they do not quite care about the details of insurance policies until disasters strike.

One of my residents received his Pioneer Generation card from me personally soon after National Day last year.

About a year ago, this Pioneer fainted on the road and was sent to a public hospital by an ambulance. He had to stay one night at the hospital for observation. When he was discharged from the hospital, his children had to pay a hefty medical bill on his behalf and he was frowned upon by his own children. Since then, he refused to seek any medical treatment for fear of incurring medical costs. It was not until our PG ambassador explained the PG package to him again on a one-to-one basis late last year did he have the courage to open the nicely wrapped PG gift hamper and use the PG card.",3,532,012-002-093-003-015-532,742

I would suggest that the Minister could consider recovering the outstanding premium from the person's other accounts in his CPF such as the Ordinary account, Special account, Retirement account or Special Retirement account, etc, before appointing a defaulter's agent to recover the outstanding premium from other means. In this way, no Singaporean can claim that he has money in his CPF but cannot use it to pay the MediShield Life premium and ended up being sued by the Government.

I thank the Members' support for the Bill, and the support for universal coverage to ensure that no Singaporean is left behind to shoulder any unexpectedly high medical bills on his own. There are pockets of Singaporeans who may not fully appreciate the benefits of a universal Scheme.

For example, some may make additional contributions to employees' Medisave while some may purchase Integrated Shield Plans for them. Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked about how Singaporeans with portable medical benefits from their companies can also benefit from MediShield Life Scheme. It is for this reason that the Government encourages companies to move towards portable medical benefits and they are supported by incentives to do so.

Members in the House have shared concerns about the premium affordability, which were also brought up during the MediShield Life review.

Ms Tin Pei Ling and Mr Baey Yam Keng expressed their concerns about Pioneers who may face difficulties with higher premiums over time. Sir, allow me to recap the rationale and assurance of the Pioneer Generation Package. The intention of the Pioneer Generation Package is to provide Pioneers with greater assurance so that they do not have to worry about their healthcare costs, including MediShield Life premiums, in their old age. The Pioneer Generation Subsidies for MediShield Life premiums are not based on means and apply equally to all Pioneers. To help with premium affordability, the subsidies increase with age, rising from 40% at age 65 to 60% at age 90. Together with the annual Medisave top-ups for Pioneers, premiums are highly affordable. To Mrs Lina Chiam's suggestion, I would like to highlight that with the Pioneer Generation Subsidies and Medisave top-ups, Pioneers aged 80 and above will have their premiums fully covered. The Government also provides annual Medisave top-up to all eligible elderly Singapore Citizens aged 65 and above under the GST Voucher to support their medical needs. Younger Pioneers can tap on this to further offset MediShield Life premiums if needed. No one, especially our Pioneers, will lose their MediShield Life coverage due to the inability to pay for their premiums.",16,571,012-002-093-003-015-571,781

We would like to assure Members like Ms Tin Pei Ling and Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef that the Government will proactively reach out to Singaporeans, including Pioneers, who have insufficient Medisave balances and insufficient family support, and assess if they need Additional Premium Support. In line with the principles of family support, eligibility criteria for Additional Premium Support will take reference from the principles of Medifund, to assist the needy with limited self and family support.",17,572,012-002-093-003-015-572,782

We announced last year that the Transitional Subsidies will offset the increase in payable premiums in the first four years of the Scheme, that is, after taking into account Premium Subsidies, with subsidy rates of 80% in the first year; 60% in the second year; 40% in the third year and 20% in the fourth year. In the fifth year of MediShield Life, after Transitional Subsidies have been phased out, lower-to-middle income households will still continue to benefit from Premium Subsidies.",20,575,012-002-093-003-015-575,785

This shift to MediShield Life is an important step and I am pleased to announce that, to further ease the transition, the Government will increase the Transitional Subsidies it will provide to Singapore Citizens for the first two years of the Scheme. In the first year, all citizens who face an increase in their net premiums will be subsidised 90% of the net increase in premium, followed by 70% in the second year. This is higher than the earlier announced rate of 80% and 60% for the first and second year respectively. The Transitional Subsidy rate for the third and fourth years of the Scheme will remain at 40% and 20% respectively. What this means is that Singapore Citizens moving from MediShield to MediShield Life will pay only 10% of the net premium increase in the first year, or less than $3 per month, while enjoying significantly enhanced benefits under MediShield Life.",21,576,012-002-093-003-015-576,786

Clause 30, in fact, relates to the power of the Minister concerned to impose appropriate terms and conditions in order to safeguard the information, such as stipulating access controls. It is not, as Mr Gerald Giam supposed, to give the Minister broad powers to approve access and disclosure of information. This is for the Minister who is in charge of the information, in addition to the Minister for Health who is in charge of MediShield Life.

Under section 59 of the CPF Act, information is shared with insurers today to enable them to administer Integrated Shield Plans for their policyholders and enable the use of Medisave for these plans. Clause 37(8) enables this sharing of information to continue. In addition, clause 37(8) tightens the scope of disclosure compared to section 59 of the CPF Act, where the Minister's approval is needed before information can be passed to insurers.

We can do more with everyone's help. All of us – patients, healthcare providers, insurers, family members – need to do our part. For example, healthcare providers should provide care that is appropriate and not over-prescribe tests or medication, and help to guide patients in making wise and cost-effective treatment choices. More expensive does not mean better, as highlighted by Dr Lim Wee Kiak. CPF Board and private insurers need to continue to carefully monitor claims for inappropriate or excessive treatment. Most importantly, all of us can encourage each other to make healthy choices, such as eating healthily, wisely and exercising regularly.",48,603,012-002-093-003-015-603,813
2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Dr Lily Neo has suggested building some incentives akin to the No-Claim Bonus into MediShield Life Scheme, to encourage Singaporeans to stay healthy. This was also raised by those who participated in the MediShield Life review. The MediShield Life Review Committee weighed the pros and cons and decided that there are better ways to promote healthy lifestyles. They were concerned that with incentives like the No-Claim Bonus, patients might delay treatment to maintain their No-Claim Bonus, which could result in serious consequences. Moreover, the need for medical treatment may not always be avoided even when good care is taken, such as when accidents occur or for congenital conditions. Introducing incentives in the Scheme may unduly penalise these patients even when it is no fault of theirs.",49,604,012-002-093-003-015-604,814
2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),The Ministry will also play its part. We encourage patients and doctors to bear in mind cost-effectiveness even as they seek out newer treatments. We work with clinicians to develop clinical protocols and guidelines. This is to encourage cost-effective treatment of patients and choice of drugs. Hospitals are required by law to provide financial counselling at the point of admission to help patients make informed decisions.,50,605,012-002-093-003-015-605,815

2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Members have also asked about the benefits of the Scheme, such as whether claims can be paid for self-inflicted injuries or whether benefits can be extended to new areas. MediShield Life does not cover self-inflicted injuries so as not to encourage such behaviour. But if the injuries arose from mental illness, as mentioned by Ms Chia, we will review their coverage on a case-by-case basis.",53,608,012-002-093-003-015-608,818
2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Some asked about the need for Integrated Shield Plans (IPs). My Minister of State has suggested three key factors to consider. I would encourage Singaporeans to consider carefully, whether you really need the IP and whether you are prepared to pay the higher premiums, not just when you are young, but also when you are old. Miss Penny Low has also cautioned against overspending on IP, and as a result, depleting Medisave. With the substantial enhancements, MediShield Life will be adequate for the vast majority of Singaporeans. Therefore, consider very carefully when you think about IP.",54,609,012-002-093-003-015-609,819
2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Dr Lim Wee Kiak suggested that the MediShield Life Scheme also covers palliative care, medication, outpatient mental treatment and preventive dental and eye screenings. The Member is among many who hope for MediShield Life to include additional benefits. We have already taken a significant step from MediShield with the benefits proposed by the MediShield Life Review Committee last year. We will continue to review how we can improve MediShield Life in future, but there is a need to balance premium affordability and benefit coverage. In the meantime, there are also other forms of subsidies, such as those under the Community Health Assist Scheme, which can help Singaporeans with other healthcare expenses.",55,610,012-002-093-003-015-610,820
2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"Sir, let me conclude. Many Singaporeans who took part in Our Singapore Conversation and the focus group discussions hosted by the MediShield Life Review Committee supported having a universal national healthcare insurance scheme, not just for the benefits and assurance that it brings to those who are covered, but also for the ideal behind such a national Scheme – that all Singaporeans will come together as a nation to build this healthcare safety net, so that no one is left behind.",56,611,012-002-093-003-015-611,821
2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"The debate on this Bill has largely focused on the how and the what of the MediShield Life Scheme – how do we carry through the recommendations of the MediShield Life Review Committee and what each of us have to do for the Scheme to work well. It is also important for us to revisit the why – why did we embark on this national health insurance Scheme in the first place. MediShield Life Scheme is the embodiment of Singaporeans' aspiration for a more inclusive, caring and progressive society. It is this aspiration that guided the development of this Scheme, how we make it easier to extend help to the vulnerable and the needy, why we include those with pre-existing conditions, how we ensure those who are able will pay their premiums, and the reason for wrapping up the debate in these themes.",57,612,012-002-093-003-015-612,822
2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"The Government will do our best to support all Singaporeans in this significant shift to MediShield Life and the Bill is designed with this in mind. We are facilitating premium payments and eligibility checks for subsidies so that the vulnerable groups among us will receive timely help with minimal hassle. We seek Singaporeans' understanding and help to work with us in extending the support for those who are less well-off amongst us. Individuals should continue to play their part to uphold this collective responsibility that many have pledged their support for, which include leading healthy lifestyles and making wise healthcare decisions. This will go a long way in ensuring that premiums will remain affordable for everyone.",58,613,012-002-093-003-015-613,823
2015-01-29,MediShield Life Scheme Bill,012-002-093-003-015,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"I would like to reiterate that this Bill goes beyond providing the legislative framework for the operation of a national Scheme. It is a Bill that provides many firsts in the Government's efforts to help Singaporeans fulfil their aspiration. Like many first steps, there will be lessons to learn from and things to improve on. We will work with Singaporeans to bring the Scheme closer to our vision as we move forward. If there are hiccups along the way, I am sure there will be, please bear with us and we will do our best to fix them as quickly as we can. Sir, our common aspiration is clear, and the journey towards it has begun. I would like to urge the Members of the House to give your support to the MediShield Life Scheme Bill, and join us in this journey towards a more inclusive, caring and progressive society.

I outlined some of these in my response to Mr de Souza’s Question No. 42 on the Order Paper for the sitting on 19 January 2015, on the benefits of an ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). Like the AEC, the FTAAP will facilitate and enhance the flow of goods, services, and investment. Tariffs and other trade barriers would be reduced. Trade rules would be improved for an environment that better supports businesses. Our companies would thus be able to operate with reduced costs and greater certainty. Our region would be even more attractive to investments. Our citizens would benefit from having more choices and jobs created.",2,3,012-002-093-003-017-003,845

This means greater trade and investment opportunities. The FTAAP would offer a potential market of more than 2.8 billion people3. The Asia-Pacific market is significant to Singapore and ASEAN. Singapore’s trade with APEC economies currently stands at more than USD560 billion (or more than 70% of Singapore’s total trade)4. ASEAN’s trade with APEC stands at almost USD2 trillion5. Singapore’s investments in the APEC region account for more than 60% of our outward investments. More than one-third of foreign direct investment in Singapore comes from APEC economies6.

On 28 December 2014, immediately after AirAsia Flight QZ8501 was reported missing, the Singapore Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC), which is the central agency that coordinates search and rescue operations in Singapore, contacted BASARNAS, the Indonesian National Search and Rescue Agency, to offer Singapore’s assistance and support. Two of our C-130s were placed on standby. I spoke to my counterpart, Defence Minister Ryamizard, over the phone just before noon and offered Singapore’s assistance. Upon acceptance by BASARNAS, our first C-130 was activated by the Singapore RCC at 1500H to assist in the search. Over the next two days, three RSN ships and two helicopters joined the search - a Frigate [RSS Supreme] and a Missile Corvette [RSS Valour] and a Landing Ship Tank [RSS Persistence] with two RSAF Super Pumas. Officers from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore were also attached to BASARNAS to assist in the overall coordination of search operations.",2,3,012-002-093-003-018-003,850

First, I hope Members appreciate why the SAF needs to maintain a high level of operational readiness. Even though it was the last weekend of the holiday season, our servicemen responded quickly and gave their full effort. An RSAF C-130 aircraft was airborne within two hours of activation, and our aircraft and ships were the first foreign forces to arrive on scene.

The SAF goes to considerable lengths to ensure that our servicemen, including NSFs, undergo demanding and rigorous training. We train them hard so that when they are activated for actual operations such as the search for QZ8501, they can carry out their mission with the highest standards of professionalism. In fact, during the operations, other than the regulars, there was a total of 56 NSFs who were involved. The combined team had to contend with rough seas and poor visibility due to bad weather, which hindered the launching of aircraft and search efforts. On some days, the waves were more than two metres in height – and our sailors on board the Navy’s vessels were out in the open sea for the entire duration of their deployment. On 14 January 2015, our determination and training paid off when MV Swift Rescue spotted and identified the fuselage of the missing aircraft.",7,8,012-002-093-003-018-008,855

Serious disasters and accidents can affect any country, including Singapore, without warning. And when it does, neighbours should assist one another.

2015-01-29,Pre-flight Briefings for Pilots of All Departing Commercial Flights,012-002-093-003-021,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"  The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) requires all Singapore carriers to provide their pilots with relevant information for their preparations before each flight. This must include weather information, Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), status of the aircraft, the estimated passenger and cargo load for the flight, and the recommended flight plan, amongst others. Our airlines usually provide the information through a pre-flight information package prepared by the respective airlines’ flight operations centres. CAAS does not mandate that such information for the pilots be provided through pre-flight briefings. This is consistent with international practice.",1,2,012-002-093-003-021-002,867
