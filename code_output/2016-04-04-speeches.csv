2016-04-04,Take-up Rate for Digital TV Assistance Scheme,013-001-094-011-001,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"  Madam, I thank Ms Sun Xueling for her question on our transition from analogue to digital signals for TV broadcast.",1,2,013-001-094-011-001-002,2
2016-04-04,Take-up Rate for Digital TV Assistance Scheme,013-001-094-011-001,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Madam, we launched the Digital TV (DTV) Assistance Scheme on 29 September 2014. The Assistance Scheme is meant to provide about 160,000 low-income households with a free digital set-top box and indoor antenna, which will allow them to use their existing television sets to receive DTV signals. Once an estate is able to receive good indoor DTV reception, that is, they are DTV-ready, MDA sends notification letters to eligible households and makes available application forms for the Assistance Scheme at the community centres and social welfare offices.",2,3,013-001-094-011-001-003,3
2016-04-04,Take-up Rate for Digital TV Assistance Scheme,013-001-094-011-001,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"MDA produces DTV information booklets in four languages that are sent to individual homes once the estate is DTV-ready. MDA has also advertised the digital switchover initiative on TV, radio, MRT trains, bus stop shelters, as well as print and online media. MDA is partnering retailers and organising roadshows in the heartlands to encourage early DTV adoption. Public response has been positive. In a survey conducted by MDA in December 2015, we were encouraged to note that 62% of households knew how to receive DTV channels.",3,4,013-001-094-011-001-004,4
2016-04-04,Take-up Rate for Digital TV Assistance Scheme,013-001-094-011-001,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Since the launch of the DTV Assistance Scheme, over 84,000 households have been notified of their eligibility, and close to 39,000, or 46% of these households, have received the assistance package. Madam, we are on track to notify all eligible households by early 2017 when all estates are DTV-ready.",4,5,013-001-094-011-001-005,5
2016-04-04,Take-up Rate for Digital TV Assistance Scheme,013-001-094-011-001,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"MDA assesses that the adoption rate of 46% for the Assistance Scheme is a good sign. There are several reasons why a household may choose not to accept the assistance package. Firstly, they may already be a pay TV subscriber, and hence will not need a separate DTV set-top box. Secondly, they may have purchased newer-model TV sets that are DTV-ready. The third possibility may be that despite the letters going out, they may still be unaware of the transition to digital broadcasting.",5,6,013-001-094-011-001-006,6
2016-04-04,Take-up Rate for Digital TV Assistance Scheme,013-001-094-011-001,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"It is this third possibility that we are most concerned about. We will continue to engage the public and our stakeholders to raise DTV awareness. MDA plans to step up publicity in the lead-up to the cessation of analogue broadcasting at the end of 2017, and to track and encourage early adoption among households. Apart from public communications, MDA has worked with the voluntary welfare organisations and senior activity centres to reach out to the elderly and the disabled, to assist them with the digital switchover. We are confident that more and more households will switch to DTV as we near the shutdown of analogue TV broadcast.",6,7,013-001-094-011-001-007,7

These include reading corners at 11 Senior Activity Centres.

What the library staff will do, as and when new collections come into their possession, a review would be done and written up, and these are made accessible, as I had mentioned earlier, at the NLB website. In fact, if you go to the Orchard Road Library, there are panels where we put up new books with a bit of a description as to what each book is all about. We will continue to curate content in such a way to attract new users to our libraries. If you were to look at our mobile app, there will be short excerpts about some of the books that you may be interested in.",1,10,013-001-094-011-002-010,22

The reason is that there is a nearby library called the Cheng San Public Library. Having said that, there may be communities that are interested in setting up their own community library, as had happened in Sengkang. The volunteers in Sengkang decided to set up a community library as the renovations are taking place at the Sengkang Public Library. NLB is prepared to assist any community group who is prepared to take the lead in setting up their own library corners or libraries to serve the needs of their residents.",2,11,013-001-094-011-002-011,23

First of all, do you represent the fraternity? Are you the only one who has expertise or has interest in this sport? Is this a recognised competition at the international level?

The day-to-day security operations include surveillance via CCTVs, patrols and immediate responses to security incidents by security personnel, and access controls against unauthorised entry to restricted and sensitive areas.

Agencies like EDB, SPRING, IE Singapore, A*STAR, JTC, WDA, IDA among others have been excellent and effective organisations in carrying out their respective missions. But as we press on for a decisive shift in our economic growth strategy, we have to examine whether the scope of work of different agencies can be better integrated, and whether we can eradicate overlaps and re-mission the agencies if necessary. And whether, do we need an ""M&A"", so to speak among the agencies?",29,32,013-001-094-011-010-032,113

I do not agree. I think it was a choice for Singapore which the founding generation made and for which the founding leaders took responsibility.

And because they took early and decisive action, Singapore gained a valuable lead over many other countries that subsequently took the same route.

Today, there are few who seriously doubt the need for Singapore to continue to remain open and welcoming especially to foreign manpower. The disagreement which exists has been about how much and in what manner to accommodate, not in the fundamental principle of being open to investment and talent.

The DRCs, which are quantitative restrictions, mean that aside from determining their willingness to pay, employers have to make a further determination of the numbers of workers they are entitled to hire under the quota. Basic contradictions occur when both price and quantity restrictions are required to be fulfilled at the same time. Some of the problems we have observed in the labour market could be manifestations of these contradictions. Let me take one common example. There have been complaints about situations where local workers are hired mainly to justify DRC-based eligibility for foreign hirings.",21,75,013-001-094-011-010-075,156

One possible solution is to forcibly reverse the order of the two-stage hiring decision process. In practice, a system that requires employers to decide the quota they want before pricing their entitlement would end up being quite similar to the COE system for vehicles. Of course, this is a suggestion which commentators have raised in the past and which I am sure policymakers would probably have considered.

My concerns about the DRCs come from the head and not the heart. In my heart, I have no doubt why there was a need to resort to quantitative controls on top of imposing levies. I believe for instance that as a Singaporean worker, I probably benefit directly from such a system. But it is no use to have short-term benefits which diminish our long-term prospects. It is in our interest to ensure that the system remains viable for the long term.",27,81,013-001-094-011-010-081,162

Although I am opposed to extended wage support, I have no hesitation in acknowledging the Finance Minister for what can only be a decision made from his heart not to immediately discontinue such schemes. There is no doubt that loss of jobs and the uncertainty associated with job search is an emotionally costly affair on those of our fellow Singaporeans who become affected.

Yet, fellow Singaporean workers have remained stoic through each and every ensuing downturn, maintaining their faith in the almost un-paralleled capacity of the Singapore economy to create jobs. It is no mean feat, to continue to generate jobs in an increasingly sophisticated economy packed into one of the most congested cityscapes in the world.",30,84,013-001-094-011-010-084,165

In a time of disruptive change, it may be better ensure that the mechanisms for the market-driven reallocation of resources are allowed to function normally than to be slowed. That is why I hope the Finance Minister will re-consider his promise under the Adapt and Grow Initiative of expanded wage support for retrenched workers. What I would urge him to do is to tie any support to specific conditions, such as the job search process. Although it is a difficult decision, I am certain that to preserve the policy effectiveness of these and other innovations, the Government must ensure that it is not just creating jobs, but continues to be focused on the more important task of creating longer term employment opportunities of value.",31,85,013-001-094-011-010-085,166

If we look at R&D as an example, in terms of R&D spending as a percentage of GDP, it is well known that Singapore ranks behind a number of countries. In 2012, the figure of around 2% for us was half that of world leaders, Israel and the Republic of Korea. But dollar spending has been high.

With virtually no more derelict structures to tear down, we have to choose which good buildings should make way for even newer infrastructure whenever we contemplate a make-over.

In general, people tend to term sunset industries for those deemed to have no future and where profits are not easily forthcoming. As a matter of fact, those so-called sunset industries could thrive as long as they clearly understand market changes, discover changes and address them, and succeed in restructuring and upgrading their industries. In this regard, local food processing industry, furniture manufacturing industry and garment fashion industry are examples of success. What they share in common is that their industry leaders are united, have vision, courage and determination; they seek a way out amidst changes and have the gumption to try. Not only have they led their industries from the bleak winter into the spring, but they also managed to uplift the image of the entire industry, hence attracting young people to join the industry, bringing with them new ways of thinking and new ways of doing things.",3,222,013-001-094-011-010-222,303

Traditional industries are mainly involved in the areas of clothing, food, accommodation and transportation; they will continue to have demand even when time evolves. We live in an era where Infocomm Technology is already a norm. However, some shops still operate like before by waiting around for customers to drop in, hence have little business; some industry players adapt to the change by using online sales to expand their market reach, and do very well.

The role of government officials in economic transformation is to gather resources and promote industry development through policies.

In this regard, the collaboration among enterprises, as well as the close partnership among enterprises, TACs and government agencies, is of great importance. I really hope to see that the Government could obtain an in-depth understanding of industry development processes and needs, to avoid wrongly interpreting the situation and trends during the process of structural adjustments.

We have grown from an entrepot trading centre to manufacturing, to a thriving global city, actively engaging in regional and international dialogues from social, political to medical science; we are plugged in to the global network.

It is found in all cells, hosting critical biochemical processes like respiration and energy production. In short the mitochondrion is the power house of the cell. Because it has a structure that is very similar to a bacterium, many scientists believe it started off as a free-living bacterium many million years ago.

I think there is far more room for SME Government support such as access to finance, tax incentives, cash grants schemes, and so on, to be much more calibrated based on the aspirations of SMEs. We can give more aggressive support and higher quantum of incentives and agree on stretch goals with those local enterprises who want it and – this is the crucial point – who can deliver results.

More publicity should be created around existing SME Talent Schemes among both SMEs and students to drive the take-up rate even higher, which I believe is possible.

This structured framework differentiates the industry as the client, as opposed to a feedback provider, and the research institution as the expert adviser, researcher and developer. As a client, the industry will be better able to communicate its greater insights to direct outcome of the research. I also believe this framework would result in the creation of IP that would be relevant to the industry, which would, in turn, create intangible impact on the Singapore economy and community.

To this end, we see a continuation of some existing schemes to support businesses, such as the Wage Credit Scheme and an extension of the Special Employment Credit which provides a modest offset for wages paid to Singaporeans. These measures benefit employers and employees still on the payroll. The painful reality is that there is a significant proportion of Singaporeans who have lost their jobs or are at risk of losing their jobs. What is the size of this problem? The Minister said that unemployment remained low at 1.9% but this percentage included foreigners in the computation. What about unemployment among Singaporeans?",2,391,013-001-094-011-010-391,472

2016-04-04,Debate on Annual Budget Statement,013-001-094-011-010,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, it is time for the Government to put in more efforts to measure under-employment. Unlike unemployment which refers to the extreme situation of a total lack of work, measuring underemployment will indicate what extent a person is suffering from a partial lack of work. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), measure underemployment is increasingly relevant for industrialised countries. The ILO noted that many countries were facing changes in the employment situation, labour market flexibility and the rise of various forms of non-standard employment. Thus, new situations have emerged that can be regarded as under-employment. According to the 16th International Conference of Labour Statisticians, under-employment reflects an under-utilisation of a productive capacity of the employed population.",8,397,013-001-094-011-010-397,478
2016-04-04,Debate on Annual Budget Statement,013-001-094-011-010,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Measuring under-employment usually starts off with the time-related measures, namely, the hours worked versus the hours that the employee could be available and willing to work. We note that the Government has been putting up some statistics on time-related underemployment in the Labour Force Reports. While looking at under-employment based on time is certainly useful, it does not present the full picture. Returning to the General Manager, for example, the fact that he works five hours a week, as compared to a full 50-hour week is one indicator, but it is also relevant to consider that he is now drawing pay at a rate that no longer commensurate with his qualifications and his experience. A person's earning potential is just as relevant as the hours spent at work.",9,398,013-001-094-011-010-398,479

Secondly, the Government in time should go beyond this to look into a substantive measure of under-employment and publish that.

As a society, we should devise some safety nets to give them some peace of mind. To this end, the Government should look into the feasibility of introducing redundancy insurance. One model could involve requiring workers resident in Singapore and their employers to each contribute a very small percentage of the employee's monthly salaries towards a fund. The fund should be geared towards helping workers who undergo involuntary unemployment, meaning those who are made redundant, including those terminated with notice. The fund could gear towards giving a six-month payout at a fraction of the worker's last drawn salary, say, 40%, subject to a cap, say, based on a median wage. Such modest scheme of limited payouts which end after six months will send a clear signal that only a temporary buffer is being provided incentivising the worker to actively prepare to earn his own income again.",15,404,013-001-094-011-010-404,485

Yet, against this backdrop, we also have recent news of much-touted companies in high-growth sectors such as Rakuten and Double Negative exiting Singapore.

He left the familiarity of his old job and got a new one with a 3D printing company developing prototypes. The company is doing brisk business and he is now doing well.

2016-04-04,Debate on Annual Budget Statement,013-001-094-011-010,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Now, I come to the second facet of transforming employment facilitation. We need to broaden the adoption of the apprenticeship system so that for certain industries, our youths are much better prepared for work. In the German and Swiss style of apprenticeship, students not only learn real-time industry-relevant skills, but also work habits from mentors. They also pride themselves equipping apprentices with problem-solving skills on the shop floor and not only in the classrooms.",9,445,013-001-094-011-010-445,526
2016-04-04,Debate on Annual Budget Statement,013-001-094-011-010,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"However, such schemes can be costly. Can the Government consider further incentivising companies, especially promising SMEs, to start apprenticeship schemes as opposed to just internship programmes commonly implemented today? Employees and unionists can be trained to become certified mentors and appraisers. And because students and workers know that what they learn is practical, there is good career path, they will more likely stay on the job. We can create an ecosystem of continual training and upgrading that is truly win-win-win. In preparing workers for the future, a tripartite partnership is and will be an important catalyst.",10,446,013-001-094-011-010-446,527

Minister for Finance Mr Heng Swee Keat proposes for transformation through innovation, and for innovation to be pervasive across all segments of society. This is a point well picked up by hon.

Furthermore, Minister Heng's proposal for the ICT sector addresses many of millennials' desire for continual innovation, definable skills level and broad-based level application of their skills. For example, the Techskills Accelerator programme would identify the skills needed in the industry, match them with specialised training providers and chart a clearer path on careers in the sector.",12,448,013-001-094-011-010-448,529

To ramp up our national capabilities quickly, we should fill these jobs not only with new entrants from the IHLs, but also from millennials seeking career changes and displaced mid-career IT professionals. Yet, we all know that competencies such as data anaIytics, cyber security and applications development require extensive and lengthy training. How will the Government help working Singaporeans to maintain their income while working towards these new competencies? How can we help the displaced professionals to quickly get into these new jobs? How can we scale up the professional conversion programmes?",14,450,013-001-094-011-010-450,531

For the ICT sector to attract local talent, our workers in the industry can be afforded better employment security. The Singapore branch of Double Negative was responsible for some of the visual effects in several Hollywood blockbusters, such as ""Man of Steel"" and ""The Hunger Games"". It was indeed an important symbol of a thriving media ICT industry. Yet, its departure was sudden. It was not a unionised company and workers were offered retrenchment terms less than market practices. The young employees' faith in the sector might be shaken.",15,451,013-001-094-011-010-451,532
2016-04-04,Debate on Annual Budget Statement,013-001-094-011-010,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"It is certainly much easier for tech and media companies like Double Negative to uproot itself compared to a manufacturing plant. It is also true, lest we forget, that the only job security is not unemployment or redundancy insurance, but value add and mobility. Therefore, how can we put in place strong employment facilitation and reassure our workers that this is a good industry despite its volatility? I encourage the Government to work with the Labour Movement to better provide workplace support and care for workers.",16,452,013-001-094-011-010-452,533

We need to have the mindset that even in a period of slow growth, there can be many bright sparks, if we choose to look for them.

2016-04-04,Debate on Annual Budget Statement,013-001-094-011-010,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Ultimately, the aim here is to do a little bit more from a tax payment perspective to allow Singapore to have a slightly stronger foundation to better withstand global economic shocks. The rationale for considering the CY basis is to enhance the effectiveness of the tax system as an automatic stabiliser and to help taxpayers better manage their cash flow by matching tax payments and incomes. Indeed, a shift to the CY basis could increase the compliance burden of the tax system, cause uncertainty for some taxpayers, and also reduce cash flow flexibility for others. An accurate system of assessing current year income is also important for a successful PYE scheme. But the macroeconomic benefits of shifting to a current year system or scheme, may have added support now as under the preceding year (PY) basis, tax is paid on income earned in the year before – which would hit newly retrenched or those who just had a pay cut or even those with a wage freeze amidst rising costs.",6,480,013-001-094-011-010-480,561

To those who harbour such intentions, let this be a shot across the bow.

However, the vulnerable group in this current environment of structural change would also include those who are in their mid-careers and higher up the corporate ladder. They are graduates, earning higher salaries, in their 40s and are often targeted for lay-offs as part of cost-cutting measures. Others are let go because they become redundant as their skills are no longer relevant or required. This applies also to those who are non-graduates, diploma holders. They would have housing loans, renovation loans and car loans to service. And then there are children's school fees, school transport, three square meals a day for the family.

So, I urge the Government to look into recruiting more mid-career people and give priority to those who were retrenched. Also, I do hope the Government and society do not discriminate those who hold part-time degrees.

Another 30% possess either ITE or Diploma qualifications.

To me, this is important because their children are also Singaporeans. In addition, I welcome the Fresh Start scheme and hope that the conditions stipulated for families to receive the grant will not be too strict. Finally, for the low income elderly, there is the Silver Support Scheme, and while the upcoming community network for the elderly is a good measure, nonetheless, I hope that some flexibility can be given, for instance, to those who may be living in a bigger flat, but do not have savings, or family support, or have no children.

The example that I shared just now, about people moving from offline to online, does not mean that jobs are destroyed and no new jobs are created. In fact, although the retailer who used to have a physical shopping outlet might be displaced, on the other hand, there are new jobs that are being created at the e-commerce, data management, and logistics management fronts. So the problem is not the total number of jobs available in the economy. The real question is how do we help the person who is displaced at the retail line get into another job that has been created? It will be too far-fetched, for most of the time, to expect someone who is displaced at the retail scene to be able to go onto the e-commerce or data management space with minimum training.",16,63,013-001-094-011-012-063,642

After Dr Goh Keng Swee's time, we have had a rough rule of thumb that has worked very well for us. For every dollar we earn in our lifetime, we save one-third of it. That is essentially the basic CPF system. If you earn $100, the employers put in $20 and we put in $20. This means that there is $40 in the CPF out of the total of $120, hence one- third. Where did Dr Goh get that magic number of saving at least one-third? That is because most of us work two-thirds of our life and then spend one-third in retirement. If we start working at the age of 20 and retire at 60, we work 40 years. And if we live until 80, that means that we need to prepare for 20 years of our life in retirement with 40 years of earning. Hence the rough rule of thumb, without taking in the interest rate and escalation in medical cost, would require us to save at least one-third. This is a choice that we must allow people to make  some people would like to save more and retire earlier whereas some would want to work longer and prefer to save less.

If giving out money is the KPI, then perhaps MTI and MOF will not be sweating so hard because it is easy to give out money. To achieve real productivity growth, we need to go sector-by-sector and, sometimes, company-by-company.

SMEs agree with, and are appreciative of, the measures implemented by the Government. However, they face a big challenge  they do not have enough manpower and time. Even though the Government has implemented so many good policies, they wonder, ""How can we benefit from them? Do I have the time to understand all these measures? Or is it a case of there seemed to be many options but none is within reach?"" In this aspect, we are heartened by the Finance Minister's announcements. If the Government can streamline these procedures and consolidate various measures; if workers can be sent for proper training and there is partnership with SMEs, then I believe SMEs will benefit tremendously and be very grateful.",28,102,013-001-094-011-012-102,681

So, as Government officials, we cannot just wait for them to apply for these schemes or come forward to understand these programmes. That is being too passive. For NTUC, we will be pro-active in helping to promote these programmes for SMEs to benefit from it. If we can all do that, even if it is just an ordinary policy, we will see good results. On the other hand, if we do not convey the message to SMEs during the most crucial period, even the best policies will come to nought.

Actually, SMEs have combed the entire Singapore but Singapore will always be a small market. We all know that if an SME makes $10 out of every Singaporean, it will only be a millionaire. But if you go overseas, for example, to big cities in China and India, you only need to make $1 out of every customer and you will become a billionaire. Singapore is a small country and a small market, but it does not mean that we cannot venture overseas and conquer other markets. However, it is easier said than done, and requires cooperation from IE Singapore and other economic agencies to help our SMEs expand out of the domestic market and venture abroad. Only when they go international to conquer a bigger market then our SMEs will become MNCs of the future. So, do exercise and move around more.

We are very interested in the bosses of SMEs — big or small. They have two key areas of needs. Firstly, we often talk about the training of workers but bosses need training too. For example, at the recent training session organised by the Bosses' Network, companies' bosses get to upgrade their skills and open their minds which help them achieve breakthroughs. When bosses achieve breakthroughs, workers will follow likewise. If bosses cannot make a breakthrough, then there is no need to even talk about productivity. In this aspect, NTUC will continue to organise programmes for companies' bosses to learn from each other and share best practices with the rest of SMEs in Singapore in the shortest time possible. Secondly, the SMEs face great difficulties in terms of manpower training.. In this regard, NTUC will launch training programmes to help our SMEs strengthen human resource management.

For instance, SMEs could undertake automation projects, re-engineer workflows, acquire new technologies and train its workers. However, some SMEs might find the capital cap of $1 million limiting.

Even with a sound business plan, many things can go wrong when launching a new business.

Securing a space is a challenge, as most high-traffic malls are run by REITs and will not take a risk on unproven concepts. Even if they were able to obtain a space, they might have to sign a two-year lease, with significant penalties for early termination. This greatly increases the risk facing any potential start-up F&B operator. Would it be possible, for example, to collaborate with mall operators to offer ""co-hawking"" spaces, providing start-up F&B businesses access to high-traffic at affordable rent with flexible lease terms to test out their concepts for six months before graduating to permanent locations if they prove successful?",11,156,013-001-094-011-012-156,735

We certainly do not want to give the impression that small businesses can do whatever they like and the Government will bail them out.

His company, which employed more than 100 foreign workers at its peak, had run into severe financial problems due to the downturn in the property sector.

Currently, they are rarely used by SMEs as they are prohibitively expensive to set up, with all parties engaging lawyers to negotiate their positions. Negotiations can also drag on as 75% of each class of creditor need to agree. Would it be possible for the Government to create a forum for facilitating the resolution of creditor disputes in the event of insolvencies involving outstanding amounts below a certain cap? This would function in a manner similar to a small claims tribunal or other mechanisms to lower the transaction costs for all parties while ensuring fair outcomes.",20,165,013-001-094-011-012-165,744
2016-04-04,Debate on Annual Budget Statement,013-001-094-011-012,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"There is scope to strengthen such arrangements. For example, every business has a few key contracts that allow it to continue trading. This could be contracts relating to supply of raw materials or lease agreements. Some of these contracts may contain a provision where, if the business enters into a Scheme of Arrangement, the contract may be terminated. Let us keep these contracts, ranging from supply contracts to lease arrangements, alive during the duration of the scheme. This allows a company with a fundamentally sound business with misaligned cashflow, the breathing room to allow it to operate and trade back into success, creating a more stable business environment.",21,166,013-001-094-011-012-166,745

Currently, there are plans to permit ""super priority financing"" to help these businesses attract funds to restructure their businesses.

If we are to encourage entrepreneurship in our country, we need to develop greater tolerance for business failure. Businessmen should not have to face criminal charges and possible debarment from hiring foreign workers if their plight was due to genuine business difficulty, not any malicious intent to defraud workers.

In this regard, I welcome the measures in the Budget to further assist with the costs of bringing up young children. Two measures are of particular note. First, the First Step Grant provides $3,000 into the child's CDA account. This account can be used for the child's healthcare and childcare needs and this can be of help to them. Additionally, parents will also continue to enjoy dollar-to-dollar matching for amounts put into the CDA grant. Thus, if they put an additional $3,000 in their CDA account, this will be matched dollar-to-dollar by the Government. Currently, not all parents fully utilise this account and some do not use it at all.

It was tasked to study entrepreneurship in several major cities. Committee members were told by some in the US that the US government has no role in developing entrepreneurship, but Singapore went ahead anyway to put all the policies and support in place to nurture entrepreneurship. At that time, the foreign observers commented that Singapore was probably one of the few countries in the world that had put in so much effort to promote entrepreneurship. Subsequently, Singapore Government's effort to promote entrepreneurship has been cited as a successful model by Mr Josh Lerner, who is the author of the book ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams  Why Public Efforts to Boost Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital Have Failed – and What to Do about It"".

2016-04-04,Debate on Annual Budget Statement,013-001-094-011-012,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"The Special Employment Credit (SEC) is another example. SEC was introduced in 2011 to provide support to employers to hire older Singaporean workers. It is supposed to expire this year but it has been extended to 2019. The SEC fund will be topped up by $1.1 billion this year. Does SEC really influence employers to employ more workers above the age of 55 years old? Of the five employers I have asked to over the last one week, ranging from SMEs to MNCs, all of them conceded that the SEC did not influence their decision to hire older workers. Given the current tight labour market, they will employ workers above 55 years old as long as they qualify for the job, regardless of the SEC. However, all the five employers, as expected, welcome SEC as it improves their bottom line. Rather than just merely extend the SEC for another three years, my suggestion is to increase the employer's CPF contributions rate of workers who are between 55 and 60 years old to 17%, that is, the same as workers who are below 55 years old. Just increase the employers' contribution rate for the workers between 55 and 60 years old.

Since 2014, individuals who hold the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) or Pioneer Generation (PG) card can receive these tests for free at Screen for Life GPs, and receive subsidies for their doctor’s consultation fee, if they are due for screening. With these subsidies, CHAS and PG patients paid an average of only $2 per visit last year.
