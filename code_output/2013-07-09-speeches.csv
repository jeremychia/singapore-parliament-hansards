2013-07-09,Rate-rigging Activities at Banks in Singapore,012-001-090-020-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"MAS carried out its review of the benchmark submission process, on an industry-wide basis, and calibrated its supervisory actions against all 20 banks, taking into account three factors  first, the number of traders within the bank who attempted to inappropriately influence the benchmarks; second, the number of banks with which the traders had collaborated, and third, the number of times these attempts occurred.",2,8,012-001-090-020-002-008,15
2013-07-09,Rate-rigging Activities at Banks in Singapore,012-001-090-020-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"MAS has censured the banks involved and directed them to adopt measures to address their deficiencies. The banks must report their progress to MAS on a quarterly basis, and conduct independent reviews to ensure the robustness of their remedial measures. The banks have started implementing the remedial actions as directed by MAS. Nineteen banks have also been required to set aside additional statutory reserves with MAS for a period of one year.",3,9,012-001-090-020-002-009,16
2013-07-09,Rate-rigging Activities at Banks in Singapore,012-001-090-020-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The imposition of additional statutory reserves represents a financial cost to the banks, in terms of the borrowing cost or the income foregone as they would have to place these reserves with the MAS at zero interest. In considering the level of additional statutory reserves to be imposed on the banks, MAS had taken into consideration the amount of penalties imposed by other regulators for deficiencies in the setting of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) benchmarks. At the same time, MAS also took into account the smaller size of our financial markets compared to those in the major economies. For example, the estimated contracts size referenced to Singapore dollar benchmarks is less than 0.2% of that which is referenced to LIBOR.",4,10,012-001-090-020-002-010,17

MAS may vary the duration that the additional statutory reserves are to be placed with MAS, depending on its assessment of whether the remedial measures put in place by each bank are adequate. If any of the banks fail to comply with MAS' directives, MAS can impose other penalties, including fines.",5,11,012-001-090-020-002-011,18

In fact, the banks' senior management took the MAS-initiated review seriously and co-operated fully with MAS. Many banks dedicated substantial senior management time and financial resources to do the review. Their strong commitment to do the right thing showed that banks here believe in upholding the integrity of Singapore's banking system, its financial markets and its banking professionals.",8,14,012-001-090-020-002-014,21

Nonetheless, in this instance, MAS was of the view that it would be in the public interest to name the banks involved and to give an indication of the seriousness of the lapses in each bank, MAS therefore announced on 14 June the supervisory actions that it took against groups of banks.",13,19,012-001-090-020-002-019,26
2013-07-09,Rate-rigging Activities at Banks in Singapore,012-001-090-020-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Like other major jurisdictions, the setting of financial benchmarks is not a regulated financial activity. As financial benchmarks are typically developed by the industry in response to market needs, we have so far relied on industry self-governance of the activity. Hence our regulatory frameworks do not provide for specific criminal or civil sanctions for the manipulation of such benchmarks. This is also the case in many other countries, which do not have the regulatory powers to comprehensively penalise rate-fixing activity.",14,20,012-001-090-020-002-020,27
2013-07-09,Rate-rigging Activities at Banks in Singapore,012-001-090-020-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Going forward, however, in light of this and other recent experiences abroad, MAS will strengthen its regulatory powers and oversight of key financial benchmarks, including the SIBOR, SOR and FX Benchmarks. Legislation will be changed to prohibit the manipulation of any financial benchmarks and to introduce criminal and civil sanctions for such misconduct. Taken together, these changes will enhance the credibility of financial benchmarks in Singapore, and minimise the risk of benchmark manipulation. MAS is conducting a public consultation on the proposed regulatory framework and will finalise the framework taking into account feedback from the consultation as well as the evolving global regulatory standards.",15,21,012-001-090-020-002-021,28
2013-07-09,Rate-rigging Activities at Banks in Singapore,012-001-090-020-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Besides the MAS regulatory measures, the industry also has an important part to play in enhancing the robustness of these benchmarks. In this regard, the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) and The Singapore Foreign Exchange Markets Committee (SFEMC) have announced measures to improve the robustness of the benchmark rates. These measures include enhancing the governance framework for benchmark rates setting, and changing the methodology used to determine certain benchmark rates so as to place more reliance on actual transactions. MAS welcomes these new measures.",16,22,012-001-090-020-002-022,29
2013-07-09,Rate-rigging Activities at Banks in Singapore,012-001-090-020-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In sum, MAS has taken firm and appropriate supervisory actions against the banks, based on a careful assessment of their respective deficiencies. Its actions are proportionate to the scale of the misconduct uncovered, and reflect the smaller size of our markets. MAS' prompt supervisory response, together with the enhancements to the regulatory framework for setting key financial benchmarks will safeguard the credibility and reliability of such benchmarks set in Singapore.",17,23,012-001-090-020-002-023,30
2013-07-09,Rate-rigging Activities at Banks in Singapore,012-001-090-020-002,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"  Mdm Speaker, I thank the Acting Minister Lawrence Wong for the comprehensive reply. Given the severity of the interest rate rigging activities by the 133 traders, the punishment received by the banks appears to be a light tap on the hand. In contrast, RBS was fined $610 million for rigging LIBOR. With the current excess liquidity in the world, the banks would hardly feel a pinch by having to set aside extra reserves with zero interest rate for a year. Maybe MAS could consider asking the banks to pay a few million dollars in fine and use the funds to help the lower income families. For example, the lower income families who were affected by the recent haze. Thus, my first supplementary question is  would MAS consider asking the banks to pay a fine in lieu of extra reserves?",1,24,012-001-090-020-002-024,31
2013-07-09,Rate-rigging Activities at Banks in Singapore,012-001-090-020-002,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"The second supplementary question is in fact a clarification. Mr Wong did not seem to have replied to the first portion of my question, as to which bank has the highest number of traders who had tried to rig the interest rates, as well as the highest number of attempts to rig the rates between 2007 and 2011. If the information is confidential, I hope at least that Mr Wong can share with us who is the highest ranking officer who had rigged the interest rates and asked to leave the job? And of those who stayed, what is the highest ranking officer?",2,25,012-001-090-020-002-025,32
2013-07-09,Rate-rigging Activities at Banks in Singapore,012-001-090-020-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"  Madam, I thank the Member for the follow-up questions. In terms of the severity of the actions taken by MAS and compared to what other regulators have done overseas – which was alluded to by the Member – I would say that MAS has indeed looked at what other regulators have done. We have looked at it and then adjusted according to the size of the markets. As I mentioned earlier, the estimated contract size referenced to Sing dollar benchmarks is only about 0.17% of the estimated size of contracts referenced to LIBOR and EURIBOR benchmarks. So there have been some adjustments to take into account the different size of the markets. Other than that, we have looked at what other regulators have done in terms of financial penalties and MAS has adjusted and calibrated our actions accordingly.",1,26,012-001-090-020-002-026,33
2013-07-09,Rate-rigging Activities at Banks in Singapore,012-001-090-020-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"MAS' actions are not in the terms of a fine but in terms of additional statutory reserves. This in itself, as I mentioned in my reply, would impose a significant burden on the banks. MAS is unable to impose a specific fine because we do not regulate rate-setting activities today; neither do many other jurisdictions. In fact, the jurisdictions that impose the fine did not rely on their financial regulations to impose the fine. They relied on other legislations and regulatory measures to impose the fines. It was not through financial regulations.",2,27,012-001-090-020-002-027,34
2013-07-09,Rate-rigging Activities at Banks in Singapore,012-001-090-020-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In our case, we have looked at whether the actions undertaken by these individuals were criminal. CAD and AGC had investigated thoroughly and we were unable to find sufficient evidence to prosecute. We have not taken any further action, but MAS has taken firm and appropriate action through the imposition of additional statutory reserves.",3,28,012-001-090-020-002-028,35
2013-07-09,Rate-rigging Activities at Banks in Singapore,012-001-090-020-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the second point about which bank had the highest numbers of traders who tried to manipulate the rates, I would say that MAS has put out information according to groups of banks based on the severity of the attempts to inappropriately influence the benchmarks. That information has been put out – in terms of groupings of severity. The group of banks that ranked highest in terms of severity of attempts is public information – UBS, ING and RBS. That is out in the public domain.",4,29,012-001-090-020-002-029,36
2013-07-09,Rate-rigging Activities at Banks in Singapore,012-001-090-020-002,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"   I thank the Minister for his comprehensive response. I have three supplementary questions. One, in light of the fact that financial benchmarks in the future will be using actual trades instead of current survey method, which makes Singapore one of the first countries in the world to implement changes in the way benchmarks are calculated, I would like to ask the Minister how local interest rates and foreign exchange are likely to be impacted, especially during periods of high market volatility and tight liquidity under the new system where we use actual trades as benchmarks.",1,30,012-001-090-020-002-030,37
2013-07-09,Rate-rigging Activities at Banks in Singapore,012-001-090-020-002,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"The second supplementary question which I think is in a lot of people's mind is that, given SIBOR is the most commonly used rate to peg local mortgage interest rate and has large impact on the consumers, could the Minister share with the House the background and details on why SIBOR will exceptionally continue to be set using the survey method?",2,31,012-001-090-020-002-031,38
2013-07-09,Rate-rigging Activities at Banks in Singapore,012-001-090-020-002,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"The last question is this. At the individual level of responsibility, yes, Minister, I think all banks have taken action. But we have observed different banks had taken different kinds of actions against the traders, eg, some are forfeiting their bonuses; some have demotions, and they are really at the discretion of the banks. What appropriate disciplinary action could MAS have taken on individual traders in proportion to their role and degree of misconduct to send a consistent and strong signal to the industry that such behaviour will not be condoned?",3,32,012-001-090-020-002-032,39

2013-07-09,Rate-rigging Activities at Banks in Singapore,012-001-090-020-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"  I thank the Member for the three questions. Let me take them in turn. In terms of a sort of assurance of actual rates, especially if volatility were to be high, I think that is something that we will have to monitor. This idea or the principle of relying more on actual versus survey rates is a principle that I think, internationally, regulators have discussed and have endorsed this move towards using actual rates. Will it have an impact when the markets are more volatile, when there is lack of liquidity, and then how do you actually look at actual rates, because there are not enough trades in the market, I think that is an issue that is real. But it is something that we have to evolve as we go forward. It is an issue that is not just us confronting it but many other regulators are looking at that same issue. And that is also why, to answer her second question, not all rates, not all benchmarks have moved to actual rates. For some benchmarks, we are still using survey data and that includes SIBOR. Likewise, we are not the only ones looking at this issue because on some benchmarks where there are data, where there are actual transactions where the markets are liquid, we are using actual transacted data. For other benchmarks, we are still relying on survey submissions by banks. And SIBOR is one of them. Likewise, in other jurisdictions, they are moving step by step rather than doing a sort of conversion entirely. For SIBOR, even though it is still based on survey submissions, what we have done is to enhance the governance and look at improving the oversight mechanisms. And this was done with the Association of Banks and with that more robust system, even though it is still on a surveillance method, I think the SIBOR system would be more robust than it used to be.",1,35,012-001-090-020-002-035,42
2013-07-09,Rate-rigging Activities at Banks in Singapore,012-001-090-020-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the third point about sanctions on individuals and whether there is consistency in terms of what MAS can do, as I mentioned earlier, for the individuals that we investigated, we could not find evidence to prosecute for criminal wrongdoing. Therefore, the sanctions that have been done are taken at the company or firm level. Yes, there are differences because there are differences in the actions that each individual took and these have to be case-specific. Firms have done different things − some have demoted; some have asked that these individuals to leave but, across the board, the actions that these individuals have taken will be on the record and the industry, as a whole, has committed to a reference check so that in future should they apply for jobs within the industry, the actions that they did this time will be on the record and will be taken into consideration for future employment.",2,36,012-001-090-020-002-036,43
2013-07-09,Rate-rigging Activities at Banks in Singapore,012-001-090-020-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"That is approach we have taken, taking into account the fact that there was not sufficient evidence to pursue further action on an individual basis.",3,37,012-001-090-020-002-037,44

Madam, at any point in time, there is a whole range of things that are being circulated on the Internet. The Police cannot realistically be expected to respond to every one of these possible events. So the SOP is usually to respond to specific reports which have a basis, in fact, in terms of activity on the ground. So, that comes to the second question the Member has posed in terms of the response of the Police. First, the Police, uniformed officers, were on the ground, within15 minutes or so of receiving the report; second, there were also plainclothes officers deployed to the site.",1,7,012-001-090-020-003-007,51
2013-07-09,Illegal Protest at Merlion Park by Malaysians,012-001-090-020-003,Mr S Iswaran,"Why did they allow the event to continue to the end? Well, the answer is because they made a tactical assessment on the ground that they wanted to observe, identify who were the main participants or players, and then to take action against them subsequently, which was what happened, rather than make an intervention. So I think the assessment of the officers on the ground was that this was the best course of action and we accepted that.",2,8,012-001-090-020-003-008,52

For those who are able to care for their elderly, we hope that they will take on their responsibilities dutifully. For those who are already in trouble, we will find some other ways to support the elderly.

Many of them do want to try their best to reintegrate with their families, which is why it is always a very difficult decision for some of the elderly to even bring their children to court or to take legal actions to enforce the payment. Because I think for many of the elderly in such situations, they already feel very bad and sometimes quite shameful that their family has abandoned them. So our first priority is really to take care of the welfare of the elderly and make sure that the elderly is taken care of and re-establish the care and long-term care arrangement for the families. And, of course, we urge every member of the community to do our part to take care of our elderly so that we do not have a situation whereby the elderly are either abandoned or neglected at the homes, even in Singapore.",2,9,012-001-090-020-006-009,77

First of all, as far as obligations of the Town Council are concerned, I think the Minister would be aware that all conservancy contracts of Town Councils typically contain a clause requiring our conservancy contractors to conduct cleaning of high areas of hawker centres at least once a year. And he would also know that this is the case with the Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council as well. So would he not agree, first of all, that there is no incentive for the Town Council to get hawkers to pay extra because our contractors are obliged to provide this service in the first place?",1,16,012-001-090-020-007-016,95

There is no law requiring the annual cleanings to coincide with the spring cleanings as such. And during our Town Council's discussion with NEA, we are given to understand that NEA is open to us having alternative dates for the cleaning of the high areas.

But does he not remember that this whole confusion started because of an email from an NEA official on 7 February? In fact, if he looks at that chain of correspondence, he will see that the Town Council staff were asking NEA to confirm the dates for the scaffold erection and dismantling, and the reply that came back was, that the Hawkers Association would be making arrangements with their own contractors for the scaffold erection and dismantling. So how is the Town Council supposed to read that? Is that something that the Town Council supposed to be blamed for?

On a major cleaning, which involves the roof, you close for five days. Why were the hawkers in Block 538 so angry? I will tell you why they were angry with you. They closed for five days.

That is my question to you. That is the central issue here. Because we believe, based on consistent testimony of all the hawkers, file-notes and emails, that this is what really happened.

In fact, the Town Council has come up with a schedule for annual cleaning. But I thought it would be good, if you get the annual cleaning together with the spring cleaning. Thereby, you save all the problems of coming back to clean the high areas after the spring cleaning. That is why I went out to speak to them, and to persuade them, ""Let's do the work together"". Once a year, out of the four spring cleanings, for one of them, let us do the high rise cleaning. Finish. That is the position.",5,56,012-001-090-020-007-056,135
2013-07-09,Town Councils' Role in Cleanliness of Hawker Centres ,012-001-090-020-007,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan,"  Mr Low, that is precisely the point. There are four cleanings a year. One of those four will be a full comprehensive cleaning, including the high areas. This is not something new. This has been going on for 10 years. Even in Block 511, your Town Council did it last year. Of course I think it was a different contractor, but you did it last year. So you cannot say that your staff are confused or did not know, or that Ms Sylvia did not supervise, and all these were a misunderstanding. I am afraid it is not, you see. The evidence is incontrovertible that your Mr Tai said, ""Not my problem, anything above 2.5 metres."" It is clear. And he also said – and not once, you see, on three separate occasions, with witnesses – ""You want it clean? Pay me extra"". That is the crux of the whole matter, you see. Unless you say Mr Tai is not your officer, not your authorised one. But by my understanding, and when I checked, I understand that he is an employee of FMSS, your Managing Agent; he is the Property Manager of Aljunied Town Council. So what he says, those words have to be taken seriously. What he says is the position of the Town Council and you have asked for money, you have denied responsibility. I have tried to show you in my answer. We are not inventing new rules here. It has been around for 10 years. Everyone, including you, when you were personally supervising Hougang Town Council, had no problem. We had no problem working with you. But now – I do not know whether it is lack of supervision or people somewhere in your organisation, someone is trying to cover up – we have this unnecessary distraction. That is basically why I said we can discuss all the minutiae that Ms Sylvia Lim wants to, but the simple crux of this matter is what did Mr Tai say and what did he fail to do? To me, that is very clear. And because that is very clear and backed up by evidence, I find the denials – the public denials by Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Pritam Singh – very, very troubling.",1,57,012-001-090-020-007-057,136

On the first point about the problem of illegal tour guiding persisting, from STB's perspective, the enforcement activities continue. As I elaborated earlier, they have stepped up the activities. Inevitably, there will be some instances which persist. The other element in this is the regulatory review. We need to ensure that STB has the full range of powers in order to be able to take action on the spot on the ground when some of these activities are detected. This is one of the areas we are working on and that might account for, in some instances, some delay after enforcement to be able to bring the perpetrators to book.",1,8,012-001-090-020-008-008,146

They serve very specific niche purposes, including in some instances, guiding in foreign languages – Russian, Korean and so on. They serve a useful and important purpose. More importantly, the overwhelming majority of our registered tour guides are Singaporeans and locals who understand our context best, and therefore they enjoy a significant comparative advantage in this sector. At this stage of our assessment, there is no need for such ring-fencing as the Member has suggested. However, we will continue to track this matter and see if there is any need for further intervention in that regard.",2,9,012-001-090-020-008-009,147

I have encountered instance of low-income residents who have asked their employers to not give them increments for fear that that would push them over the edge in terms of either qualifying for a flat or having to pay a higher rental. I appreciate that the HDB has discretion as to whether their impose an increase or not, but I think the difficulty, essentially, boils down to the fact that the discretion will be exercised after the increment is given or accepted.

I also thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the statistics in terms of families that move from rental to ownership. However, my experience is that there is a number of families which are really in a chronic stage, which are not likely in the short term to go into ownership status.

We now give automatic waiver of the rental increase if their income moves from $800 to $1,500. Previously, it was discretionary, depending on a case by case basis. I had made that announcement in an earlier session. So we now give automatic waiver of the rental increase. This is what we call the cliff effect. Previously, the moment you hit above the $800 mark, they will charge higher rental. The concern is that the higher rental is highe than the income increase that they have.",1,8,012-001-090-020-010-008,161

If after the first two years, their rental increase is still higher than their income increase, we will still allow them to keep to the same rental rate for another two years. The Member is absolutely right in that during these two-year plus two-year term tenancy period, we need to work with the families. This is why we always say that housing is just one aspect of the life of the low-income families.

Sometimes, they are single-income families; sometimes they have the potential to be dual-income families but because of circumstances, they were not able to do so. The interface between the housing and social aspects is very important. What do we do now? We work with the FSCs and the CDCs very closely. HDB has got in every branch housing counsellors; they will help these families look at a trajectory; we call it the ""pathway of housing opportunities"". We look at what is possible for them. If they are first- timers and they have potential, we look at what that potential is. We will then work with them, for example to get grants and with the grants, the price of the flat is maybe $60,000 or $45,000 or $50,000.

So, when you look at a scenario of this nature, they grew up in a rental flat, a young adult grows up, works and has the capability to own a flat, if the income goes beyond $1,500, we do not immediately tell them, ""Please go out"". We want to tell them that you have the potential to own a flat and if you have the potential to own a flat, why not, so that the availability of rental flats could be given to others who are more deserving. Because there will be people who are asking for rental flats. People go through different life cycles, different life challenges and sometimes the rental flats could be better given to those who really are in need. So if they have the potential to own a flat, we will encourage them to own a flat, but we give them time. We give them time to work towards homeownership.",1,15,012-001-090-020-010-015,168

Even if you have gone into income levels like $2,000, sometimes circumstances do not enable them to own a flat, perhaps there is disability in the household, HDB is very, very compassionate. We look at such cases very compassionately. We allow them to continue to stay in the rental flat.

Of course, we hope the whole family goes together, if that is a family household, and we hope the child can also help to support the parents. So when they buy a flat, I think they have to look at the long-term implications. Long-term implications are whether the child can continue to live and co-live with the parents and support the parents in the new flat should they choose to purchase. Certainly, if the parents are old, we would advise them on the ability of the parents to own the flat on their own if the child chooses to marry. For such cases, the housing counsellors will actually look at each of the individual cases, assess them, provide them with relevant advice to look at the long-term implications of such choices that they can make.",3,17,012-001-090-020-010-017,170

But because of the limited stock of rental flats, we want to facilitate this continuous movement where those who are able to purchase and own their own flats should do so to provide space for those who may need the rental flats.

To spread this message, AVA has in place a Responsible Pet Ownership (RPO) programme which reaches out to the public through school talks, roadshows and mass media such as advertorials.

It is important to understand that because there are potential threats to public safety, and it is not just about sterilisation. I think when dogs operate in packs as well, it can be threatening for public safety and security, and that is something that we are concerned about.

2013-07-09,Use of HDB Rooftop Space,012-001-090-020-017,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"  Madam, there has been a growing dependence on mobile telephone services by businesses and consumers. With increasing expectations from end-users for better mobile coverage, the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) enhanced the quality of service standards imposed on mobile operators for both in-building and outdoor mobile coverage. Accordingly, IDA reviewed the Code of Practice for Info-Communication Facilities in Buildings. This was to ensure that building developments would be equipped with the minimum space and facilities necessary for mobile operators to deploy equipment required for better mobile coverage. The requirement to provide this minimum amount of mobile deployment space at no charge to the mobile operators was meant to facilitate the quick deployment of mobile equipment, so that end-users could benefit faster from the improved mobile coverage.",1,2,012-001-090-020-017-002,230

Furthermore, this space need not be set aside upfront, but only upon request of a mobile operator. Existing lease agreements for space purposed for the provision of mobile coverage within the developments will also be allowed to continue until their expiry. As such, developments that currently lease space to the mobile operators would only need to comply with the new mobile deployment space requirements after the expiry of these existing agreements.",2,3,012-001-090-020-017-003,231

Does the Minister agree that the coverage would probably be better from the rooftop as compared to a lower-lying space?",1,6,012-001-090-020-017-006,234
2013-07-09,Use of HDB Rooftop Space,012-001-090-020-017,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Secondly, we have done some checking on the frequency of access requests by these mobile operators at our Town Council for the first six months of this year and it works out to about 74 requests a month. So it is a significant number of requests and there is a certain cost incurred by the Town Council to provide access to the rooftop because it is supposed to be a secured space and so on. I think the Minister understands that. So I wonder whether the Minister would agree that this change in the COPIF would pass some burden to the Town Council, taking it away from a profit-making entity like the telcos. Would he consider reviewing at least this aspect, where access is given, could there be some arrangement where we could have a reasonable charge or get reimbursed for the cost incurred?",2,7,012-001-090-020-017-007,235

It could be in the car parks or basement. But we leave it to the MTOs to decide where exactly is the best location, in consultation with the building owner. So we do not have a preference. What COPIF does is to specify a minimum space in which the building owners would have to give to the MTOs.

My question is, for some of these villagers, in particular one resident who has been living there for the fourth generation, her name is Kamariah Abdullah. She has done great work in her house which is a really beautiful Malay house in its natural state and has encouraged people to come and stay, and enjoy what we call the ""kampong"" spirit. So what I would like to ask the Ministry is whether the Ministry has any plans to encourage like Kamariah Abdullah to stay and rejuvenate this whole life, the ""kampong"" spirit, and encourage people to go. And in addition, to support her financially or in some other ways to continue this kind of existence for the betterment, not just Singaporeans and future generations, but also tourists who come to the island.",3,14,012-001-090-020-020-014,268

First, I want to assure the Member that we take the interests of the residents very closely to our hearts. I say that because I am also the local MP for Pulau Ubin. I meet the residents as regularly as I can, and I know most of them.

We could have done better in our communications. We have a local committee in place  Pulau Ubin Changi Village, with various subcommittees which include residents in Pulau Ubin as well as Changi Village because it is their main point where they come to the mainland. Many of the residents, they used to live in Pulau Ubin and they do have some residential property in Changi Village. But they go to Pulau Ubin regularly. We are very mindful of how we should be engaging these residents. I assure the Member that I will personally connect with the residents there.",2,17,012-001-090-020-020-017,271

On how best we can facilitate her work, we can discuss with her on a separate occasion and to look at how best we can look at the whole Pulau Ubin, not as a tourist destination of sorts.

We engage the residents quite regularly, even when they have issues with regards to things that needed to be upgraded, we will continue to work with them on the nature and how we go about putting in place some of these facilities for them.

Well, I think the issue really is whether that is something that Singaporeans want. When we talk about retirement village, there are also ageing and elderly issues. To put our elderly on an island, you would need to put in a whole slew of services, and a lot of issues with regards to cost, and whether we can put those infrastructures in place.",1,21,012-001-090-020-020-021,275

I would like to ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary, in the first place, how can such a notice go out, phrased in such a way that gave the wrong impression that it would be an eviction notice and that mentions an adventure park to be developed when it is not so? Is there a process and a system in place to vet important notices that go out to residents, especially those which are potentially sensitive and distressing? And, also to do it in the various languages that they would understand; and also to echo the point that the NMP made about explaining it to residents so as to allay their fears.",1,24,012-001-090-020-020-024,278

Can I ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary whether there are plans to recognise Pulau Ubin for the special place it holds in Singapore? As you know, the cityscape is always changing with construction and reconstruction.

The letter was not the first that was sent. HDB officers sent a letter earlier last year, in 2012. The same letter, but it did not create that misunderstanding. At that point in time, they were also doing the same census. Unfortunately, this time round, it came up quite negatively and we acknowledge that we could have done better in the communications and the processes.

Whether it is a formalised process we can put in place, various agencies can come together and review that possibility. Even if we do not formalise that process, today, the natural environment and attraction of Ubin, is sufficient for Singaporeans to acknowledge that that is something that we have already.

2013-07-09,Free Pre-Peak Hour Travel on MRT Trains,012-001-090-020-023,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"  The one-year trial for free pre-peak travel aims to alleviate the morning peak hour crowding on the rail network on city-bound routes, which typically experience the highest level of crowding. A 10 to 20 percentage shift should result in a more comfortable ride for commuters.",1,2,012-001-090-020-023-002,304
2013-07-09,Free Pre-Peak Hour Travel on MRT Trains,012-001-090-020-023,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"The trial was launched on 24 June 2013. The results in the first two weeks have been encouraging. On average, comparing the first two weeks’ data with the exit patterns in May and June 2013 before the start of the trial, and making appropriate adjustments for overall ridership changes so that higher or lower ridership and seasonal effects are corrected, we are seeing about 6% to 7% decrease in exits for the peak period of 8.00 am to 9.00 am, and about 18% to 19% increase in exits for the pre-peak period of between 7.00 am and 8.00 am.",2,3,012-001-090-020-023-003,305
2013-07-09,Free Pre-Peak Hour Travel on MRT Trains,012-001-090-020-023,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Another way to measure the effectiveness of the trial is how much we have been able to smoothen the morning peak in our rail network. Again, this will take time to fully study, but just based on the exit patterns of the past two weeks, we are seeing some smoothening. Prior to the trial, peak period exits for the one-hour period between 8.00 am and 9.00 am through the 16 city MRT stations was around 2.7 times that of the one-hour pre-peak period between 7.00 am and 8.00 am.

These include new rail lines, additional trains, and upgrading projects like re-signalling of the North-South and East-West Lines, all of which will be ready progressively in about two to three years’ time.

2013-07-09,Emergency Response to MRT Disruption along North-East Line in June 2013,012-001-090-020-024,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,  LTA and SBS Transit (SBST) are still investigating the cause of the train fault that disrupted services on the North East Line on 19 June 2013.,1,2,012-001-090-020-024-002,310
2013-07-09,Emergency Response to MRT Disruption along North-East Line in June 2013,012-001-090-020-024,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Preliminary investigations show that when the train fault occurred at about 6.15 pm, SBST attempted to recover train operations by pushing the faulty train to Hougang station, and allow passengers to alight there before withdrawing the train from service. This is the normal procedure, when the safety of passengers is not compromised and lighting and air-conditioning in the train are still functioning. Passengers will then avoid having to detrain in the tunnel and walk along the tracks to the nearest station. However, in this instance, the rescue train and the faulty train could not be coupled, and the push-out operation was not successful. SBST then decided to commence detrainment. Throughout the process, SBST staff were on hand to provide assistance to the detrained passengers.",2,3,012-001-090-020-024-003,311

Short loop train services were also maintained between HarbourFront and Woodleigh stations. At bus bridging points, LTA and police officers were deployed for traffic and crowd control.

Many commuters have given feedback that more information could have been made available in a timely manner. Many affected commuters also had difficulty boarding buses at Woodleigh and Serangoon stations, due mainly to the heavy commuting traffic during the evening peak period which delayed bus arrivals.",4,5,012-001-090-020-024-005,313
2013-07-09,Emergency Response to MRT Disruption along North-East Line in June 2013,012-001-090-020-024,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"I take a very serious view of how this incident was managed. When LTA put in place stricter requirements for incident response following the Committee of Inquiry’s recommendations last year, the intent was to avoid subjecting passengers to great discomfort during train disruptions. In this incident, the required timing to commence detrainment was not met2. LTA is investigating the circumstances for the delay in detrainment, and will continue to work with both operators to improve incident management. Since last year, the public transport operators have refined their incident management plans and processes. LTA, in turn, has updated the Codes of Practices on incident management to include lessons learnt from past incidents, and conducts random surprise audits at train stations to ensure that operators are adequately prepared to deal with disruptions and are familiar with the execution of their incident management plans. In addition, LTA regularly conducts table top and ground deployment exercises with both operators to enhance their preparedness and capabilities in handling disruptions. LTA shares lessons learnt from these exercises as well as from past incidents and audits with both SMRT and SBST. I have emphasised to LTA that it must continue to work closely with them to continuously improve their incident management.",5,6,012-001-090-020-024-006,314

2013-07-09,Benefits and Allowances for Non-Singaporean Academic Staff at Universities,012-001-090-020-025,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The specific amounts for housing and other allowances are not meaningful, as these are part of the total remuneration package. Many of the Autonomous Universities and polytechnics grant relocation allowances and housing subsidies to non-Singaporean faculty and returning Singaporean faculty alike, although the exact terms differ across institutions. Non-Singaporean faculty are typically granted a gratuity payment, in lieu of Central Provident Fund contributions, which is payable for Singaporeans and Singapore Permanent Residents. Some institutions grant children education allowances to non-Singaporean faculty to take into account the fact that school fees for non-Singaporean children are higher than that for Singaporean children in Singapore. These measures have been put in place to meet the different needs when hiring faculty.",2,3,012-001-090-020-025-003,317
2013-07-09,Use of Past Reserves since 2002,012-001-090-020-026,Mrs Lina Chiam,"asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance in light of a 2011 media report that past reserves have been used 27 times for Selective En-bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) projects since 2002, how many times have the past reserves been used for all purposes since 2002.",1,1,012-001-090-020-026-001,318
2013-07-09,Use of Past Reserves since 2002,012-001-090-020-026,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,  I thank Mrs Lina Chiam for her question in which she referred to a Straits Times interview with former President S R Nathan in August 2011. The article mentioned that Past Reserves had been used to fund land reclamation projects and land acquisition for the Selective En-Bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) since 2001 and 2002 respectively. She has asked how many times the Past Reserves have been used for all purposes since 2002.,1,2,012-001-090-020-026-002,319
2013-07-09,Use of Past Reserves since 2002,012-001-090-020-026,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,Past Reserves refer to the reserves accumulated during previous terms of Government. There are several ways that Past Reserves are used.,2,3,012-001-090-020-026-003,320
2013-07-09,Use of Past Reserves since 2002,012-001-090-020-026,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"First, the Constitution provides for the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) spending framework. This enables the Government to tap the investment returns on Past Reserves in a disciplined and sustainable manner. The NIRC benefits Singaporeans substantially each year. It contributes almost $8 billion to the FY2013 Budget.",3,4,012-001-090-020-026-004,321
2013-07-09,Use of Past Reserves since 2002,012-001-090-020-026,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Second, Past Reserves have been used to fund land-related projects such as reclamation, the creation of underground space, and land acquisition projects like SERS. This is in essence a conversion of Past Reserves from one form (financial assets) to another (State land), rather than a drawdown of Past Reserves. The land and space that is created or acquired forms part of our State land holdings and is hence protected as Past Reserves. The use of Past Reserves to fund these land-related projects follows principles agreed to between the Government and the President. Further, when such land or space is subsequently sold, the proceeds accrue fully to Past Reserves.",4,5,012-001-090-020-026-005,322

The land and space that is created forms part of our land holdings and hence part of the Past Reserves.",5,6,012-001-090-020-026-006,323
2013-07-09,Use of Past Reserves since 2002,012-001-090-020-026,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Past Reserves have also been used to fund the land acquisition costs of projects like SERS which seek to enhance the value of the existing land. To reiterate, the acquired land forms part of Past Reserves, and the land value is enhanced with the more intensive re-development. Since 2002, the Past Reserves have funded 32 such projects.",6,7,012-001-090-020-026-007,324
2013-07-09,Use of Past Reserves since 2002,012-001-090-020-026,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"There is a third use of Past Reserves, reserved for exceptional circumstances. With the approval of Parliament and the President, Past Reserves may be drawn down to deal with extraordinary crises. Members would recall that the Government had obtained the President’s approval to draw up to S$4.9 billion from Past Reserves to fund the Jobs Credit Scheme and the Special Risk-Sharing Initiative in January 2009, at a critical time in the global economic crisis.",7,8,012-001-090-020-026-008,325
2013-07-09,Use of Past Reserves since 2002,012-001-090-020-026,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"The use of Past Reserves for spending in such exceptional circumstances may result in an actual drawdown of Past Reserves, unlike its use for land projects as I have described. However, Members would also recall that in this recent episode, the Government decided in February 2011 to put back the full amount that it had drawn down from the Past Reserves, after the economy had recovered from the recession.",8,9,012-001-090-020-026-009,326
2013-07-09,Use of Past Reserves since 2002,012-001-090-020-026,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"In conclusion, our Past Reserves form a critical part of our nation’s resources. Any usage of Past Reserves is done in a disciplined and sustainable manner. An actual draw on Past Reserves, as was done in 2009, can only be contemplated in extraordinary circumstances and with the approval of Parliament and the President.",9,10,012-001-090-020-026-010,327

For example, during the recently-concluded PAssionArts month, residents had the chance to work with drama artists and arts groups. A total of 30 theatre programmes and workshops were conducted for the community. These gave the residents the opportunity to tell their personal stories through drama, and co-create drama works under the guidance of theatre professionals. Residents can also join theatre interest groups at their local CCs. Some examples include ""Ageless Theatre"", a theatre interest group for seniors based at Marine Parade CC; and ""Yellow Chair Productions"", a community theatre group based at Tampines Central CC.",2,3,012-001-090-020-027-003,330

For example, under its Theatre for Seniors (TFS) programme, TNS trains senior citizens in the basics of theatre, and provides them with opportunities to participate in public performances. To reach out to youths, TNS also offers arts education workshops in areas such as playwriting, acting and drama tasters.",3,4,012-001-090-020-027-004,331

Retirees and those soon to retire, or pre-retirees, were found to have some good basic money management habits and had taken some basic steps in retirement planning. However, as with the working population, they were not very knowleadgeable about features of common financial products. Pre-retirees generally had not planned how to use their CPF savings during retirement but were keen to learn more about retirement planning.",1,2,012-001-090-020-028-002,334

Since the Act’s provisions came into force in 2010, more than 4,000 applications have been made to appoint a Lasting Power of Attorney, in other words, a decision-maker on financial matters for persons who no longer have mental capacity.

They could have raised the issue at any time while they were in Police lock-up, when they appeared in court on 29 November 2012 to be charged, or after they were released on bail on 6 December 2012. He was examined by a doctor on 4 December 2012 for gastric pain, less than a week after the alleged incidents, but did not tell the doctor of the alleged abuse.

This was why when the Ministry first explored the possibility of a UNESCO listing, it had engaged a technical expert to do a thorough and in-depth assessment to determine the site with the best chance of meeting the UNESCO criteria. As part of this process, we had done a consultation on possible sites that could be put up for the UNESCO bid.
