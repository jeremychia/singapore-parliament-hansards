2013-05-13,Impact of New Bird Flu Strain (H7N9) on Singapore,012-001-090-018-001,Mr Gan Kim Yong," Madam, since the first reports from China on 31 March this year, there have been a total of 132 confirmed cases of avian influenza A (H7N9) infection, including 33 deaths. Affected areas in China include eight provinces and two municipalities  Zhejiang, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Beijing, Shandong, Jiangxu, Fuijian and Hunan. Taiwan also reported one confirmed case who was likely to have been infected in Jiangsu, China.",1,7,012-001-090-018-001-007,7
2013-05-13,Impact of New Bird Flu Strain (H7N9) on Singapore,012-001-090-018-001,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Infected poultry and contaminated live poultry markets are the most likely source of infection. Many of the cases had such exposure, and the virus has been isolated in chickens, ducks, pigeons and environmental samples from live poultry markets. Closure of the poultry markets in Shanghai has significantly reduced the number of cases there.",2,8,012-001-090-018-001-008,8
2013-05-13,Impact of New Bird Flu Strain (H7N9) on Singapore,012-001-090-018-001,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"There is no evidence of sustained person-to-person transmission so far. Despite close monitoring of more than 2,000 contacts, only three small family clusters have been identified so far, but these could be due to either common exposure to an animal source or limited person-to-person transmission.",3,9,012-001-090-018-001-009,9
2013-05-13,Impact of New Bird Flu Strain (H7N9) on Singapore,012-001-090-018-001,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Besides the threat of H7N9, MOH is also closely monitoring another emerging infectious disease - the novel coronavirus infection first reported by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in September last year. To date, there are a total of 34 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus worldwide, with 18 deaths. Countries which have reported cases include Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom (UK) and France. The source of the novel coronavirus remains unclear. There have been several clusters suggestive of limited human-to-human transmission between close contacts, but there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of the infection so far. However, we are monitoring the progress of investigations into the latest Saudi Arabian cluster closely.",4,10,012-001-090-018-001-010,10
2013-05-13,Impact of New Bird Flu Strain (H7N9) on Singapore,012-001-090-018-001,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Madam, so long as there is no sustained human-to-human transmission for H7N9 or novel coronavirus, the risk of an outbreak in Singapore will remain low.",5,11,012-001-090-018-001-011,11
2013-05-13,Impact of New Bird Flu Strain (H7N9) on Singapore,012-001-090-018-001,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Singapore does not import live poultry, birds or fresh frozen poultry meat from China. The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) has a comprehensive inspection and testing programme for imported poultry and birds to ensure that they are free from H7N9. The local chicken farms are under strict biosecurity and AVA conducts regular inspections at all pet shops that sell birds. AVA has a surveillance programme in place for chickens and birds in Singapore, including for birds in the wetlands reserves and public parks, such as the Singapore Botanic Gardens. The H7 avian influenza virus has not been detected in tests on local and imported birds.",6,12,012-001-090-018-001-012,12
2013-05-13,Impact of New Bird Flu Strain (H7N9) on Singapore,012-001-090-018-001,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"A potential concern is transmission of H7N9 to Singapore via migratory birds carrying the virus. However, as the current H7N9 virus has not been detected in migratory birds in China, the risk of such transmission is currently low. AVA is vigilant against this possibility, and has stepped up surveillance testing on birds in Singapore, including migratory birds.",7,13,012-001-090-018-001-013,13
2013-05-13,Impact of New Bird Flu Strain (H7N9) on Singapore,012-001-090-018-001,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Nevertheless, we need to be vigilant against the possibility of cases in travellers coming to Singapore. MOH has alerted all hospitals and doctors to look out for suspect cases with symptoms such as fever, cough and signs of pneumonia, and a travel history to affected areas for H7N9 and novel coronavirus. Suspect cases will be isolated and tested for H7N9 or novel coronavirus infection. To date, MOH has been notified of 11 cases who have been investigated for H7N9, and 24 who were investigated for novel coronavirus. None have been positive.",8,14,012-001-090-018-001-014,14
2013-05-13,Impact of New Bird Flu Strain (H7N9) on Singapore,012-001-090-018-001,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Our hospitals have put in place procedures to manage suspected cases of H7N9 and novel coronavirus. These include infection control measures for management of respiratory infections, and triaging and separating of suspect cases at emergency departments from non-suspect cases to minimise risk of transmission.",9,15,012-001-090-018-001-015,15
2013-05-13,Impact of New Bird Flu Strain (H7N9) on Singapore,012-001-090-018-001,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"When a confirmed index case is detected in Singapore, we stand ready to undertake contact tracing and phone surveillance of close contacts as an added precautionary measure, even in the absence of sustained human to human transmission. ICU isolation beds are available to manage severely ill patients.",10,16,012-001-090-018-001-016,16
2013-05-13,Impact of New Bird Flu Strain (H7N9) on Singapore,012-001-090-018-001,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"WHO currently does not advise special screening at points of entry, nor does it recommend any travel or trade restrictions for both H7N9 and novel coronavirus.",11,17,012-001-090-018-001-017,17
2013-05-13,Impact of New Bird Flu Strain (H7N9) on Singapore,012-001-090-018-001,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"MOH has advised travellers to affected areas on general precautions, such as practicing frequent hand washing with soap and water, avoiding crowded areas and maintaining a high level of personal hygiene. In addition, H7N9-specific precautionary measures include avoiding direct contact with poultry, birds and their droppings, and consuming poultry and eggs that are thoroughly cooked.",12,18,012-001-090-018-001-018,18
2013-05-13,Impact of New Bird Flu Strain (H7N9) on Singapore,012-001-090-018-001,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We have put up Health Advisory posters and issued Health Advisory notices to travellers at our airports, to remind inbound travellers who have been in the affected areas to seek medical attention if they become unwell with fever and cough, and to inform their doctors of their travel history. As the June school holidays are approaching, we expect that Singaporeans will be making plans for overseas travel. We would like to remind them to be alert to the latest global disease situations for H7N9 and novel coronavirus, as well as updates to MOH's travel advisory.",13,19,012-001-090-018-001-019,19
2013-05-13,Impact of New Bird Flu Strain (H7N9) on Singapore,012-001-090-018-001,Mr Gan Kim Yong,We continue to monitor the situation for evidence of community transmission of H7N9 or novel coronavirus.,14,20,012-001-090-018-001-020,20
2013-05-13,Impact of New Bird Flu Strain (H7N9) on Singapore,012-001-090-018-001,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"MOH has actively engaged other Government agencies to coordinate whole-of-government measures to be ready for such a scenario. We have worked with hospitals and clinics to ensure that there is adequate surge capacity in healthcare infrastructure and beds. At the national level, we have sufficient personal protective equipment and antiviral stockpiles, which can be deployed should the need arises. Possible control measures include isolation of cases, quarantine of close contacts, and social distancing measures to reduce community transmission, if necessary.",15,21,012-001-090-018-001-021,21
2013-05-13,Impact of New Bird Flu Strain (H7N9) on Singapore,012-001-090-018-001,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We will continue to engage the WHO and our overseas counterparts to keep abreast of the most updated information. We are monitoring the situation closely as it evolves to ensure that public health is safeguarded. As of now, there is no indication that more drastic measures are required.",16,22,012-001-090-018-001-022,22

2013-05-13,Impact of New Bird Flu Strain (H7N9) on Singapore,012-001-090-018-001,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"  Madam, I thank the Member for the question; it is a very important one. Our hospitals have been working together with the Ministry of Health to look at how we can expand hospital capacity at short notice if there is a surge in demand. Some of this capacity could be temporary in nature in response to emergency cases due to for example the coronavirus or H7N9 should they land in Singapore.",1,24,012-001-090-018-001-024,24
2013-05-13,Impact of New Bird Flu Strain (H7N9) on Singapore,012-001-090-018-001,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The hospitals are ready. One of the possible measures, for example, is to defer some of the elective surgery so that we can free up beds for emergency cases that come in. Another possible measure that we are looking at is to facilitate discharge of the medically stable patients, either to stepdown care or help them to be discharged home. We can provide home support for these patients so that additional beds can be freed up when necessary.",2,25,012-001-090-018-001-025,25

2013-05-13,Impact of New Bird Flu Strain (H7N9) on Singapore,012-001-090-018-001,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"  Madam, up to today, the knowledge of the actual transmission mechanism of novel coronavirus is still very limited. We are watching and monitoring very closely. Reports are coming out from WHO on the knowledge that they have gained in the investigation into the various cases. So far, WHO has not recommended any travel restrictions because from their investigations, transmission is limited to very close and prolonged contact, primarily, within the same family or where they are housed together within the same hospital ward. We would follow the advice from WHO in terms of travel advisory.",1,27,012-001-090-018-001-027,27
2013-05-13,Impact of New Bird Flu Strain (H7N9) on Singapore,012-001-090-018-001,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"For us in Singapore, we have introduced several measures including notices to our travellers who are arriving in Singapore, that should they develop symptoms or fall ill and if they have the travel history to affected areas, we encourage them to see our doctors immediately so that we can provide the necessary treatment as well as, if necessary, to isolate them. For the outbound travellers, we have given general travel advice to encourage them to stay away from crowded areas, and to exercise and maintain a high level of personal hygiene. These measures will help to mitigate the potential risks.",2,28,012-001-090-018-001-028,28
2013-05-13,Impact of New Bird Flu Strain (H7N9) on Singapore,012-001-090-018-001,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Finally, on sustained transmission  when we look at the current cases of transmission, transmission tends to be between one or two persons when they are in close contact. Transmission after the second person tends to be attenuated. Sustained transmission means there is a sustained transmission beyond the immediate contact. From WHO's contact tracing, out of the 2,000 that they have followed up on, very few of them have developed these symptoms, other than the clusters I mentioned in my reply.",3,29,012-001-090-018-001-029,29

2013-05-13,Impact of New Bird Flu Strain (H7N9) on Singapore,012-001-090-018-001,Mr Gan Kim Yong," Mdm Speaker, in fact. MOH has been working with the various government agencies including our own Health Promotion Board, National Environment Agency, as well as the AVA, on outreach and public education. We want to raise the awareness of the threat of infectious diseases. During peace time, or without the immediate threat of infectious diseases, our focus has been on non-communicable diseases associated mainly with ageing and so on. But we are very much aware that infectious diseases continue to be a threat given today's globalised world.",1,33,012-001-090-018-001-033,33
2013-05-13,Impact of New Bird Flu Strain (H7N9) on Singapore,012-001-090-018-001,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"There is now a much higher volume of international travellers and infectious diseases will continue to be a threat to many countries in the world. This is an area that MOH will continue to work on with our various organisations and agencies to reach out to not just our residents at the community level but also the professionals, such as doctors and the healthcare institutions, so as to raise their awareness and to enhance their preparedness should a crisis arise.",2,34,012-001-090-018-001-034,34

The conservatories make full recovery of operating costs through the collection of admission fees.",2,3,012-001-090-018-002-003,37
2013-05-13,Tote Board's $400-million Donation to Gardens by the Bay,012-001-090-018-002,The Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Josephine Teo),"A large proportion of the Tote Board's donations goes towards social support. Over the last five years, the Board has donated $1.2 billion or almost half of all its donations to the social sector. In FY12 alone, donations to the social sector were about $500 million, or 46% of donations for that year.",3,4,012-001-090-018-002-004,38
2013-05-13,Tote Board's $400-million Donation to Gardens by the Bay,012-001-090-018-002,The Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Josephine Teo),"This includes the Tote Board Social Service Fund, through which programmes for the needy and disadvantaged are supported. Another example is the Tote Board Community Healthcare Fund (TBCHF) which supports community-based preventive healthcare programmes and builds capabilities in the Intermediate and Long Term Care sector to enable providers to offer better and more affordable care.",4,5,012-001-090-018-002-005,39
2013-05-13,Tote Board's $400-million Donation to Gardens by the Bay,012-001-090-018-002,The Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Josephine Teo),"I should add that the Tote Board positions itself as complementing Government programmes, not substituting for Government. In fact, the Board does not fund projects which it deems to be basic Government programmes. Instead, it seeks, for example, to uplift capabilities, and work with its community partners to pilot new or innovative programmes to help the needy and disadvantaged.",5,6,012-001-090-018-002-006,40

For FY12 alone, the Government spent about $1.25 billion on targeted benefits for the bottom 20% of Singaporean households, or about $6,000 per household. It includes the Workfare Income Supplement, childcare subsidies, educational bursaries and means-tested healthcare subsidies.",6,7,012-001-090-018-002-007,41

I would like to ask a supplementary question. If the two conservatories charge about $20 per entry, or less for senior citizens, is it enough to cover the maintenance and, if not, who covers the other side of the maintenance to run these two domes?",1,9,012-001-090-018-002-009,43
2013-05-13,Tote Board's $400-million Donation to Gardens by the Bay,012-001-090-018-002,Mrs Josephine Teo,"  Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member Mrs Chiam for her question. The conservatories are supposed to make full recovery on the operating costs, so they will have to assess the level of attendance at the conservatories and also adjust their admission fees accordingly. I should just add for interest that since the Gardens have opened, about 4.1 million visitors have been to the Gardens, and just over one-third visit the conservatories. This is still very early days yet. The conservatories will have to make an assessment and plan accordingly once the attendance numbers are more stabilised over time.",1,10,012-001-090-018-002-010,44

2013-05-13,Priority for Primary 1 Registration,012-001-090-018-003,Ms Indranee Rajah,"  Mdm Speaker, one part of the question is related to whether the priority was Government-linked. As mentioned in my answer earlier, quite apart from the grassroots organisations under the People's Association, there are the Parent Volunteers and there are also those who are members endorsed by the clans or churches. Of course, there are the alumni as well, but that is a different priority phase. So the short answer to that particular question, is it only Government-linked? The answer is ""No"" because there are those which parent volunteers as well as those endorsed by churches and, of course, by clan associations as well.",1,12,012-001-090-018-003-012,56
2013-05-13,Priority for Primary 1 Registration,012-001-090-018-003,Ms Indranee Rajah,"With respect to the specific question about those who are given priority under the grassroots organisations, perhaps I should clarify before I go on to deal with specific Government-linked aspects. Under the People's Association, it is not all of the grassroots committees that get priority. For example, as I mentioned earlier, it is only those in the Residents' Committee, Neighbourhood Committee, Citizens Consultative Committee and the Community Club Management Committee. There are a great number that do not get priority, such as the YEC, WEC, CSC, IRCC and a large number of others under that umbrella. So it is the ones that are residentially-linked as well as those in the community. We recognise that there are many different social groups which serve the community. But when we look at priority, we look at priority for active community leaders. And in defining active community leaders, we define eligibility based on an objective view of community service.",2,13,012-001-090-018-003-013,57

I would like to ask, firstly, how demand is determined. I am asking this because even for mature estates, there are BTO projects coming up and I anticipate that young families would be moving in.

But from observation, it is with the availability of childcare that young mothers especially can be freed up, comforted in the knowledge that their children can be taken care of, and that they can go out to find a job to supplement their household income. I would like to ask the Acting Minister if the Ministry would also provide funding to help build or retrofit some of the existing buildings to allow for the provision of additional childcare services in mature estates such as MacPherson.",2,13,012-001-090-018-005-013,84

The answer to the first question is that demand is determined by a few factors. We know that, generally, childcare places are sited either near their own homes, the parents' workplace or the grandparent's place. So how we determine demand is based on the cohort size in the respective estates. We also take in feedback from the respective community leaders, if they see a demand for such a service. We also look at the queue at the existing child care places in the vicinity so that we have a sense of what is the demand.",1,14,012-001-090-018-005-014,85

It is based on the numbers that we have on hand and it also based on the feedback from the community leaders.

We know, as I have mentioned, that there is a high proportion of young families and many of these young families do not have grandparents' support.

Some of the feedback and ideas that we have heard from community leaders include using temporary sites at empty plots of land by using temporary containers. We have also heard other ideas where community leaders have offered places in their community centres; other community leaders have suggested the use of under-utilised car parks.

When we address the issues, we address them holistically as a town, not just Punggol East but the whole Sengkang town. While there might not be immediate sites available in Punggol East, we will try to look for other places within the Sengkang town so that the whole place can share the facilities together, in particular in Rivervale Arc where there will be a place that will be pre-built into the estate and that will be coming up quite soon.",1,23,012-001-090-018-005-023,94

Yes, we have Sembawang as we have everybody on our radar screen. In fact, I think some of you may have received letters from my Ministry. We are going through town by town to meet the respective community leaders to discuss with them the local solutions. So, it is not macro planning. We are actually meeting all the community leaders, estate by estate, to address their needs.

So, if the childcare providers are able to give us the assurance, and also give the parents the assurance, that the quality is not compromised, we can look at it to see how we can adjust some of these issues. But many of the childcare operators have also come back and share with us that they do not want to have too high a ratio, meaning that one teacher taking too many students, because it affects the quality of care. So this is where we have to strike a balance.",2,26,012-001-090-018-005-026,97

2013-05-13,Shortage of Childcare Facilities in Sengkang and Punggol,012-001-090-018-005,Mr Chan Chun Sing,The other prong of the manpower approach has to do with increasing the number that we can recruit from the mid-stream recruitment. This could be part-timers that want to return to work. This is how we try to increase the overall manpower. I will be making more comprehensive announcements in a few months' time on the various tracks that we are tapping to increase the manpower.

I want to thank the Acting Minister for his considerate approach in addressing the critical childcare issues all across Singapore. In the case of Sengkang and Punggol, I want to also echo Dr Lam Pin Min and Dr Lim Wee Kiak's sentiments on convertible void deck space. In cases where there is limit in how many void decks can be converted, can the Minister seriously consider and expedite building of child care centres on state land and open plots of land, even if they might cost a little bit more?

Yes, indeed, we are actively working with the land agencies and HDB to see where we can expedite the building of some childcare centres at vacant plots in Punggol and Sengkang particularly. On the second issue about teacher ratio, let me explain that we have started to work on the pipeline about two years back, ever since I joined the Ministry. So the pipeline will be coming on stream soon.

We have since reviewed that last year where we gave the option of one-plus-one is to 12, that is, one qualified teacher plus one para edu-carer, so that the para edu-carer can perform some of the care functions that are not directly related to teaching. With that, we have also increased the capacity for many of the childcare centres that have the available space. Through this approach, whereby we give a 50% extra by employing the para-personnel, we increase the capacity and, at the same, we also provide more employment opportunities for part-timers who may not be fully trained in the profession. But over time, some of these para-personnel, once they are in the industry, can also be attracted to upgrade themselves and become a full-time teacher.

In fact, we have already done so. One of those schemes was called the Capability Development Grant (CDG) which is several different schemes combined into one. A change that was made, for example, is the streamlining the pages in the application process. There used to be 10 pages in the application form. Today, it has been reduced to two pages.

I would like the Minister of State to tell us if there are better ways to reach out to and help those SMEs who have suffered unpleasant experiences in the past as well as those who cannot understand the schemes due to language problems, so that more can better utilise the schemes.

We have been trying to have a better understanding of the issues that are facing the SMEs and the micro-enterprises, in order to come up with schemes and make sure that the utilisation rate of these schemes is up to a satisfactory level. It is not easy. The SME Centres will be staffed by officers with bilingual abilities, and even with dialect abilities.

Since 2011, we have installed surveillance cameras in certain hot spots and we have identified 12 suspects who were caught in the act of high-rise littering.

The answer is ""No, I am not satisfied with the situation"". Just to give the Member the idea of scale – we received more than 8,000 complaints of high-rise littering a year. Over the years, the number of cases that have been brought to the Courts would only be single-digit numbers. Ten to twelve a year, maximum. We introduced high-rise surveillance in fact recently, just a year and a half ago, in order to try to improve the probability of being caught. To be honest, I do not think it is high enough. On the other hand, I cannot imagine us having cameras trained on every single HDB block in the island. I do not think that is something that we want.",1,5,012-001-090-018-007-005,130

Most times, people roughly know who the culprits are. But in our traditional Asian way, we do not want to be the finger-pointer. We will have to find a more effective and local way of identifying the culprits and of resolving it at source.

Members of the House would also agree with me, that we usually try at the Town Council level, at the MP level, to visit the blocks. We know which column it originates from, and we would knock on every door. If that does not work, they get NEA involved, then NEA would do at least two rounds of knocking on doors and trying to persuade and educate people on the need to be responsible.

We even go so far as to tell people exactly when we are doing that. In quite a significant number of cases, once the cameras are up, everything is fine. Then when the cameras are down, some cases resume − the bad habits − and in which case, NEA would have to come back and put it on again. We are reviewing the SOP. For second and third deployments, we will probably not have to reveal exactly when it is up in order to have a greater deterrent effect. Right now, we see irate emails from complainants. They say, ""This is ridiculous! You put up the cameras and you tell everybody exactly where and when you are putting it up.

Arts festivals are often in a unique position to offer opportunities to artists whose passion is to inspire and stimulate us and to commission and support work that is genuinely creative. In a Festival context, we should not just be thinking about the market and what audiences want.

However, the primary purpose of the CPF remains to help members save for retirement, housing and healthcare needs. Therefore, we have limited the usage of CPF funds for education to only full-time subsidised local tertiary education courses at approved publicly-funded tertiary institutions. This is so that we have assurance on the affordability and also, quality of these courses.",1,4,012-001-090-018-010-004,171

We want to avoid duplication and enable low-income families to achieve self reliance in a holistic manner beyond just mere monetary help. So the Member is right that we want Malay/Muslim organisations to better dovetail their assistance schemes with national schemes. The general approach that we would like to take is to first explore the client's eligibility for national schemes and then with community and local schemes coming in to supplement or complement the client's needs.",1,12,012-001-090-018-011-012,188

I have a couple of examples that I have asked my staff to compile but I will give just one example. This is the case of Mr Mohamad Rafi, aged 37, and his wife, Mdm Rokiah, aged 28. They successfully graduated from the MUIS' Empowerment Scheme in December 2012 and they approached MUIS in 2011 when they were grappling with their inadequate income, arrears and even depression suffered by the wife and childcare arrangement for the children. But because of the EPS and because we worked with WDA, today Mdm Rokiah has just completed a full-time diploma in design. So the family no longer has arrears and working towards the dream of home ownership. And what is more important now, Madam, is that Mdm Rokiah is now a volunteer at one of our mosques in Ang Mo Kio. When she was asked as to why she is doing that, and I would like to quote her, she said, ""There are many more out there, worse off than us. We have been very lucky.

Paragraphs 3 to 7 of the main Review Report provide useful background on why Parliament originally set up Town Councils in 1989, and on the strategic intent behind the Town Councils Act. Then MND Minister, Mr S Dhanabalan took the Bill through the House in June 1988. Then 1DPM Goh Chok Tong set out clearly the purpose of forming Town Councils. I advise Members to read the Hansard records for a thorough understanding of this piece of legislation.",22,22,012-001-090-018-013-022,235
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Prior to 1989, all the common areas of HDB estates were maintained centrally by HDB, a Government statutory board. However, Parliament decided to give MPs more authority and responsibility over the HDB estates in their constituencies, in order to strengthen the nexus between the residents and their elected MPs. The strategic intent was to bring home to the MPs that how they manage and run their Town Council would affect their electoral fortunes at the next election. This would enhance accountability, push MPs to focus on what mattered to the residents, and in turn, encourage voters to scrutinise more closely the capabilities and the track record of election candidates. This would ultimately benefit both the voters and the residents.",23,23,012-001-090-018-013-023,236
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"In line with this objective, the MND crafted the legislation to recognise the political nature of Town Councils. As the Review Team noted, and I quote, ""The intent is to give the elected MPs as much latitude as possible to run the Town Councils within broad and general rules laid down to ensure proper governance and safeguard public interest.""",24,24,012-001-090-018-013-024,237
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"In the same spirit, when administering the Act, MND has given latitude to MPs to exercise autonomy in judging how best to achieve their agenda and advance their residents' interests. For example, Town Councils may, as they see fit, engage those who share their political cause or are affiliated to their parties. In particular, the Town Councils are able to transact with persons or entities associated with political parties. Over the years, many Town Councils have exercised this flexibility.",25,25,012-001-090-018-013-025,238
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"For example, some Town Councils have appointed fellow party members and unsuccessful election candidates to various salaried jobs, including as General Manager. One Town Council waived competition (that means did not call tender) to appoint as its Managing Agent a company owned by party supporters. MND has not interfered with such transactions. However, while MPs have considerable leeway, the substance of each transaction must still be proper and safeguard public interest.",26,26,012-001-090-018-013-026,239
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"So, to recap, Town Councils are set up for to fulfil a political purpose. Town Councils are not part of the Singapore Public Service, and so they are not governed by Civil Service rules. They are governed by the Town Councils Act. What Town Councils can and cannot do is set out in the Town Councils Act.",27,27,012-001-090-018-013-027,240

While PAP Town Councils operate in a decentralised manner, in the spirit of the Town Councils Act, they also work together as one team, tap on one another's strength, share best practices, and where relevant, make bulk purchases together so that they can get the best terms for their Town Councils and therefore their residents. That is why they have a Town Councils Coordinating Committee, currently chaired by Mayor Teo Ho Pin. That is also how the IT software got standardised for their Town Councils. In addition, the PAP as a political party stands fully behind the MPs and their Town Councils. And that was why the PAP set up AIM in 1991  to ensure that residents living in PAP-run Town Councils would be well served. I am sure later Mayor Teo Ho Pin can elaborate on how the PAP-run Town Councils work together for the benefit of their residents.",28,28,012-001-090-018-013-028,241
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"The Review Team made observations on the process of handover of Town Councils from one party to another. After an election, a new team is required to take over almost immediately. And when there is a change in political party, it is not just the MPs who change because the other Town Councillors and even the Town Council employees may change too, as it is common for MPs to tap on the support of those who share their political cause to deliver their electoral promises for the estate. However, at present, the Town Councils Act does not contain adequate provisions to deal with such transitions.",29,29,012-001-090-018-013-029,242

When PAP MP Sitoh Yih Pin was elected in Potong Pasir in 2011, he had to appoint a Managing Agent quickly to ensure continuity of services for residents. He persuaded EM Services to step in to provide the service at short notice and managed to achieve a successful handover.

Both Town Councils agreed to an official hand-over on 30 April 2013 but they needed to share the office space from 1 May as Pasir Ris-Ponggol Town Council needed more time to prepare its alternative office before it could move out. ""How to share office space"" from 1 May became a point of discussion. There was initial frustration when both parties could not agree to the proposed layout for the shared office. Differences also arose over several other issues. MND officers stepped in to facilitate the handover and broker an arrangement acceptable to both parties. Eventually both sides came to a compromise on the various issues.",31,31,012-001-090-018-013-031,244
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),There are clearly some lacunae in the rules dealing with handovers of Town Councils. We need to look into this. The Review Team has made some useful recommendations to institutionalise some change-over rules to minimise disruptions to critical services during a change in leadership. One is for Town Councils to have in place contractual provisions for automatic one-off extensions following an election when there is a change of party in charge of the Town Council. Another is to set a minimum notice period for termination initiated by the contractor or key appointment holders such as General Managers. The Town Councils themselves have suggested that MND should consider extending the period of handover and play a greater role in the process. These are all useful suggestions and MND will take them in when it updates the Town Councils' rules.,32,32,012-001-090-018-013-032,245
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"Another manifestation of the autonomy exercised by MPs is the uneven way MPs manage their respective Towns. Some Town Councils are stricter in enforcing and recovering Service and Conservancy Charges (S&CC) arrears. But others take a less stringent , shall we say, more populist approach towards such collections but at the expense of the Town Councils' long term financial health and also, of the interest of the majority of residents who do pay on time.",33,33,012-001-090-018-013-033,246
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"MND has significant concerns about the Town Councils' long-term financial health. Town Councils are required under the Town Councils Act to build up sinking funds which they will eventually need to replace big ticket items like lifts, mechanical and electrical equipment, major repairs and repainting programmes. Town Councils' sinking funds often run into millions of dollars while they build up but they will all be needed in due course many years later. Most Town Councils find it difficult to explain to their residents why their S&CC has to go up to build up the sinking funds further when the Town Council already has ""millions of dollars"" in its sinking funds. Some resort to kicking the can down the road, delaying S&CC increases which are necessary, and creating a serious problem that will emerge later when the replacements and maintenance works come due. This is clearly not sustainable.",34,34,012-001-090-018-013-034,247
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),"MND has also observed that Town Councils do not want to take on more responsibilities, especially if these carry a political cost. For example, some Town Councils are reluctant to enforce their own Town Council by-laws strictly, such as on obstruction of common corridors even though this is a fire safety risk. Another example is the disagreement over who should clean the hawker centres. There are currently two cleaning teams  one contractor appointed by the Hawkers' Association − they clean the table tops; another team by the Town Councils who clean the floor and also toilets. We know and we laugh about it. This division is inefficient but to consolidate the cleaning function into one will require the Town Councils to have to charge stallholders a higher S&CC. Most are reluctant to do so.",35,35,012-001-090-018-013-035,248
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan),These examples illustrate how political pressures on Town Councils can lead to Town Councils making sub-optimal decisions resulting in poorer outcomes for the residents. This is not a simple problem to tackle as it is an unintended consequence of the very nature of Town Councils and is deep-seated in the current practice of many Town Councils. The Team has thus recommended a review of the current Town Council framework. This brings me to the third part of the report  the need for a review.,36,36,012-001-090-018-013-036,249

The Review Team found that Town Councils have largely fulfilled the original objectives for which they were set up. Town Councils have delivered key estate services to residents in ways that conferred local flavour and met local needs. Residents enjoy far more customised services and Towns have developed their own identities in ways that HDB as a national agency could not have done.",37,37,012-001-090-018-013-037,250

It quoted one resident as saying that  ""Municipal issues must be separated from political considerations so that Town Councils can be administered in a transparent manner, serving public interest and not party interests.

The legislation to empower the elected MP to run the Town Council, so that he can respond more promptly to his residents' needs and work with his voters to shape their town's identity, has generally been a success. The need to create a nexus between an elected MP and his voters, through his work in the Town Council which has a direct bearing on the daily life of the residents, is a strategic imperative which cannot be faulted. We should not return to status quo ante where HDB administers estates all over Singapore, and MPs have no authority or responsibility over what is done or how well things work.",41,41,012-001-090-018-013-041,254

2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Further, the terms of the sale of the most critical town management IT system had unnecessarily endangered public welfare particularly the relinquishing of ownership to AIM with the one-month termination clause. MND fell short in not admonishing the PAP TCs for risking disruption to the public in the name of politics. MND also did not take cognisance of the wastage of public funds incurred when such terminations required replacement systems to be set up. In addition, the one-year sale and leaseback was clearly an underestimate of the time needed to redevelop a new TCMS. The fact that the one-year happened to straddle GE 2011 suggests that whatever good faith the TCs had in the sale to AIM, there were political objectives in crippling any new TC leadership of a different political affiliation, hence endangering the public in the process.",6,82,012-001-090-018-013-082,295

2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"This was due to the need to reconcile accounts being kept under two different IT systems with differing nomenclature. We do not believe that the AIM sale served the public interest and the public deserves to know about this and assess it for themselves. We find it unacceptable for any TC to relinquish control over critical TC assets developed with public funds to third parties who can cut the TC off from using the assets to service residents. In our view, the PAP TCs had unjustifiably risked a disruption to public services and that this should not be allowed to recur. I am relieved to read that the MND recognised the need to preserve continuity of public services as a paramount priority. The question is  why did the PAP TCs not recognise the risk of service disruption when selling the TCMS to AIM?",11,87,012-001-090-018-013-087,300
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, let me now go into some detail about our misgivings concerning the AIM transaction. The reasons given by the PAP TCs for the sale of software and intellectual property raised more questions than answers. They told MND that having the software reside in a single entity was better than having the vendor deal with 14 TCs which would be cumbersome and inefficient. But surely, this can be easily overcome since the PAP TCs have a Co-ordinating Chairman who can coordinate to ensure the proper authorisations.",12,88,012-001-090-018-013-088,301
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The TCMS was developed with $23.8 million of TC's operating funds. Surely, there is reason to retain ownership and control over it for the residents in the 82 electoral wards then under their charge. Much ado is being made in the report that the second generation TCMS was almost obsolete and had limited value. But does this mean that it is of limited value to the TCs using it now? If the system ceases to function without replacement, TC operations will grind to a halt.",13,89,012-001-090-018-013-089,302
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Another incomprehensible justification is the saving of $8,000 for the 14 TCs that arose from the sale. The $8,000 savings is the difference between $140,000 paid by AIM and the sums paid by the TCs back to AIM during the one-year leaseback. This total savings of $8,000 shared about 14 TCs amounts to about $571 per TC. Is saving $571 significant enough a reason for a TC to sell a system?",14,90,012-001-090-018-013-090,303
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Next, Madam, the tender terms. It was emphasised in the MND report that the choice of AIM was made after an open tender. Was it an open tender in substance? The tender was advertised and five companies picked up the documents. However, a closer look at the conditions of contract will reveal that the specifications required each of the Directors of the tendering company to have adequate experience with the operations and functions of a Town Council.

It was then extended by another week to give three weeks. Why the initial period advertised was one week less than the minimum was not explained at all in the MND report.

2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Next, Madam, risk assessment of AIM. The PAP TCs told MND that one of the key reasons for selling the software to AIM was that AIM agreed to bear the risk of any price increases by NCS in maintaining the software even after the original contract with NCS expired. We have not been able to find this exact clause in our documents. However, even assuming so, on what objective basis did the PAP TCs assess that it was safe to entrust this risk of cost increases to a company with a paid-up capital of $2? Who will pay in the event of a cost increase? What about the risk of AIM being wound up?",17,93,012-001-090-018-013-093,306
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The PAP TCs highlighted AIM's track record but based on the tender documents we have seen, AIM listed only one prior project, also a sale and leaseback.

2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Next, Madam, duration and timing of the sale and leaseback. MND noted that the TCs under estimated the complexity of the task of developing the new generation TCMS software. We find this quite puzzling since the TCs had experience in developing the first and second generation TCMS and should have known that one year was too short. Now, as MND has noted, two extensions were required after that and a fresh tender was only called this year, in 2013. Was there any re-development work from 2011 to now? The timing of the sale to commence a few months before the General Elections in 2011 also calls for explanation. Was it a pure coincidence or was there simply a need to sell the software quickly so that termination can be effected if political seats were lost?",19,95,012-001-090-018-013-095,308
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Madam, let me now turn to the termination clause. The reasons given by the PAP TCs for the one-month termination clause are unconvincing. First, no attempt was made to explain why a material change in the membership of the TC should allow unilateral termination by the contractor with one month's notice. It is unfortunate that MND did not seem to query this as this was the crux of exchange between the PAP and the Workers' Party. Could it be that there is simply no good reason to give?",20,96,012-001-090-018-013-096,309
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Some attempt was made to explain why termination may be fair in the case of a change in boundaries. It was said that the contractors might be faced with a much larger town than anticipated but be held to a fixed price to its detriment. I am not sure why there was this worry. At that time, the TCMS was being developed for the whole of Singapore except two SMCs, namely Potong Pasir and Hougang. In addition, the contract itself already provided for variation in price based on the number of property units.",21,97,012-001-090-018-013-097,310
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"The real stint of the termination clause lay in its one-month notice period. Is a one-month notice period reasonable for a critical IT system? It is quite clear that time is needed to develop a system of this complexity; in the PAP's own estimation, 18-24 months. Does not the PAP TCs not realise that this aspect of the AIM transaction endangered the continuity of public services or perhaps that was the intention in the case of a change in political leadership? It was fortunate indeed that the Workers' Party could use the IT system in place in Hougang Town Council and upscale it within a much bridge time to cater for a town of GRC magnitude. What if the constituency was one by a political party not running any Town Council or by an independent candidate? Or is the continuity of public services not important to the PAP once they lose a constituency?",22,98,012-001-090-018-013-098,311
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Next, Madam, no finding has been made about the wastage of public funds caused by the need to replace IT systems due to a change in political leadership. Once the system has been developed with TC funds, the residents have a beneficial interest in it since they contribute to TC funds via service and conservancy charges. Why should they pay again for a replacement system just because the Town Council Management has changed hands? Even those who live in private estates have asked me about wastage since TCs are also funded by Government grants that they, as taxpayers contribute to. MND has made a finding that there was no loss of public funds caused by the AIM transaction. But what about the wastage of public funds which the transaction brings about? Residents and taxpayers pay twice for political intrigue. How is that justifiable?",23,99,012-001-090-018-013-099,312

Town Councils provide essential public services to HDB dwellers via public funding. As custodians of public funds, all MPs must act in the best interest of residents regardless of which political party they support. At the same time, TCs unavoidably have some political elements. The manner and quality of town management is one factor in a voter's choice of MP and MPs wish to do well in town management in order to get re-elected. However, it does not mean that MPs can allow TC assets to be endangered or cut off from TC use for political reasons.",24,100,012-001-090-018-013-100,313

The IT system in use in AHPE TC belongs to the TC and will be there for use even if there were to be a change in political leadership.

The Straits Time of 7 May reported that MND gave examples of how politics and Town Councils sometimes mixed which included in our case the former General Manager of Hougang Town Council and her husband setting up a company to provide town management services to AHTC. We find this insinuation mysterious as neither she or her husband nor any of the Directors and shareholders of the company are WP members. They were hired based on their experience in property management, professional skills and track record in running Hougang Town Council. What is MND's reply?

2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"First, restrictions should be in place in the Town Councils Act to prohibit the sale of critical assets or systems still needed for TCs' operations to third parties. On no account should TCs relinquish control over the use of assets which should survive any change in political leadership. The most critical system would be the IT system for town management.

We believe that the sale of the TCMS by the PAP TCs, whatever its other ancillary benefits, was to enable AIM to cut off any non-PAP TC from using the TCMS at short notice crippling the TC. By doing so, they acted in a party political interest and jeopardised the public interest using a critical asset developed with public funds.",34,110,012-001-090-018-013-110,323
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"In this light, I cannot help but recall the parliamentary debate in 1988 when the Town Council Bill was first presented for the Second Reading. At that debate, the then first Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong justified the introduction of Town Councils as providing political stabilisers to the political system. He said there was a need to protect the public by ensuring that political parties which aspired to be Government should first prove that they could run a Town Council for a constituency.",35,111,012-001-090-018-013-111,324

Is this what this whole AIM episode about, ensuring that the passengers in the Cessnas have bumpy rides or even crash land? Does the Government even care about the passengers in the Cessnas or are they simply collateral damaged in a bigger political game?",37,113,012-001-090-018-013-113,326

We were also mindful to minimise any related costs to the handover to both Town Councils as these costs would ultimately be borne by the residents.

There was a need to apportion an area for AHPE TC to run its services for Punggol East from 1 May 2013.

Pasir Ris-Punggol TC, along with other Town Councils using the TCMS, were then in the midst of deciding how and when to transit to a new TCMS system since the TCMS' leasing agreement with Action Information Management Pte Ltd or more commonly known as AIM would expire on 30 April 2013. As such, Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council was not in a position to commit to their request. Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council also had to know the cost, technicality, legal and audit implications of AHPE TC's request for the continued use of TCMS, and all these would require time to look into.",10,130,012-001-090-018-013-130,343

Separately, Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council had also asked the service provider providing TCMS maintenance and support to work out the technical details and cost for the boundary change and other related works to segregate Punggol East from our server and for AHPE Town Council to operate the TCMS as a separate entity.",14,134,012-001-090-018-013-134,347

In an earlier meeting on 25 May 2013, AHPE Town Council requested for Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council to bear the cost of providing a new server to Punggol East in order to store the migrated data. Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council explained to AHPE Town Council that we were not able to pay for a new server to be used by AHPE Town Council as we could not make such payments under the Town Councils Act and we could not legitimately impose this cost on the remaining residents of Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC. It would not be equitable to do so.

The Punggol East area was one of these five constituencies. All constituencies shared the same server, and they still do. As such, it was not possible for Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council to give AHPE Town Council a server.

However, the years that followed saw other means used by the Government to lower the standing of a duly elected MP, even if that individual was able to run a TC competently. Denial of upgrading projects -- such as the then Main Upgrading Programme and the Interim Upgrading Programme – was a ruthless psychological PAP tactic at the polls that pandered to the selfishness of the individual, at the expense of other higher order human instincts such as fair play and equality.",3,155,012-001-090-018-013-155,368

So in spite of the original intent of the Act, even if an MP was honest and effective, the government of the day retained significant powers to cripple him, as it did in Hougang and Potong Pasir.

The presence of this clause, in the political context of the Town Councils, ought to have raised a conflict of interest red flag because a PAP-owned company and the PAP TCs had defined their rights and obligations by virtue of a contract that ran the real risk of undermining and prejudicing an incoming non-PAP run TC.",7,159,012-001-090-018-013-159,372

Beyond managing maintenance records, feedback management amongst other critical day-to-day operational functions, the Town Council would not be able to efficiently manage the collection of S&CC fees from residents. Collection would have been a cumbersome exercise, part-manual, part-electronic, and the Town Council would have been overwhelmed by S&CC collection, leaving little time for other tasks. Until a new TCMS was established, there would have been numerous disputes pertaining to the accurate collection of S&CC fees and potentially, a whole list of unfulfilled contractual obligations with the Town Council's contractors.",8,160,012-001-090-018-013-160,373

The prospects of this reality would explain why the AHTC team worked in the months after May 2011 to stabilise Town Council operations and upscale the former Hougang Town Council's IT management system, instead of allowing the residents of Aljunied GRC to be potentially held at ransom by a one-month termination clause in the hands of fully-owned PAP company.",9,161,012-001-090-018-013-161,374

However, beyond the contention that the AIM transaction was not in the public interest, if one reflects on the historical context in the aftermath of the passing of the Town Councils Act, a fully-owned PAP company's right to terminate the TCMS was in keeping with the philosophy that has defined the relationship of the PAP government with opposition-run Town Councils since 1988, and therein lies the inherent conflict of interest surrounding AIM – a conflict of interest that has been duly recognised by discerning Singaporeans.",10,162,012-001-090-018-013-162,375

Of particular significance is MND Report's recognition of public calls to depoliticise Town Councils, a point that was somewhat reinforced by a Straits Times poll of 7 May 2013 where 41 out of 50 residents called for the same, the main concern for some being the lack of a political level-playing field and its impact on residents.",12,164,012-001-090-018-013-164,377

For the specific purposes of this debate, depoliticisation must mean that companies owned by political parties should not tender for Town Councils contracts – a glaring omission from the MND report. In addition to the recommendations called for by the Member of Parliament for Aljunied GRC Ms Sylvia Lim, the report's call for depoliticisation – if executed as imagined by most Singaporeans – would effectively entail inducting a new brand of politics into Singapore insofar as Government-Town Council relations is concerned, representing a hope and desire that goes far beyond the findings of the MND report, but one that is in line with public expectations.",13,165,012-001-090-018-013-165,378

In the AIM context, the larger point is that critical assets like the Town Council's IT system and its intellectual property must remain part of the Town Council and cannot be terminated unilaterally. Non-PAP Town Councils must be allowed to effectively manage the town without political interference by HDB or MND, or have its functions compromised by policies that serve a political purpose to the advantage of the ruling party.",15,167,012-001-090-018-013-167,380

Depoliticising Town Councils will not mean anything if political calculations continue to determine how MND or other agencies deal with non-PAP Town Councils.

Firstly, even though there was nothing wrong with the transactions between Action Information Management Pte Ltd (AIM) and the PAP Town Councils, the fact that they had business dealings with a company, which was set up by the PAP in 1991, and its directors who were their very own party members, could raise questions on whether there was any conflict of interest.",6,176,012-001-090-018-013-176,389

If they are public, then they should also be made to adhere to tight corporate governance procedures including reporting processes and requirements, conflict of interest and to include these in their annual report card which is being, anyway, done. The ideal scenario for the Town Council should be that their processes and operations are far removed from any traces of conflict of interest and so even when they deal with vendors; these vendors should be as independent as possible with little or no association to the town council members or the political party. The annual report card should then also score the town councils on its ability to do this so as to encourage them to move towards these better governance practices.

2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"First, the termination clause. The MND review has not fully addressed how public interest is being served when a vital piece of software for town management developed at a combined cost of $23.8 million was offloaded to a PAP-owned company for $140,000 with an unusual termination clause made in favour of the new owner.",5,211,012-001-090-018-013-211,424
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"The termination clause reads, ""The contractor may in his absolute discretion terminate the services during the contract by giving three months' prior notice in writing to the Town Council. However, in the event that there are material changes to the membership of the Town Council or there are material changes in the scope and duties of the Town Council, including but not limited to changes to its present boundaries, the contractor may give a month's notice in writing if he wishes to terminate the services during the contract period.""",6,212,012-001-090-018-013-212,425

How are the interests of the residents protected in such an arrangement? And what are material changes and why is it so important that if such changes were to happen, AIM could just give a month's notice to terminate its services to any Town Council?",7,213,012-001-090-018-013-213,426

Nonetheless, the PAP Town Council felt that the provision of such a one-sided termination clause was quote ""fair and reasonable as the vendor would have priced its bid on the basis of the existing TC and town boundaries. However, should this change materially, the vendor could end up providing services to a TC comprising a much larger area and a larger population of residents. But it is held to do so at the same fixed pricing since a key feature of the contract was that there should be no price changes to the TC even for extension. The TCs felt that this would be unfair to the prospective vendors. And that a clause explicitly addressing such changes would reduce the business risk to the vendor. This would help fetch a better tender price for the TCs old software"".",8,214,012-001-090-018-013-214,427
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"While the above explanation may sound logical, I would explain to this House point by point why the provision of the termination clause, you can see, makes absolutely no sense at all.",9,215,012-001-090-018-013-215,428
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"First, there would always be changes made to the size and population of the town because of Build-to-Order flats, Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme, private development and constant redrawing of our Electoral Boundaries. Is it then prudent to allow AIM or any new owner of the TCMS to simply walk away from this critical contract citing material changes and leaving an entire town in the lurch? How is public interest protected with such a one-sided termination clause?",10,216,012-001-090-018-013-216,429
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Second, in its original contract, AIM proposed a leaseback payment schedule that did not take into consideration the size and population of a Town Council. All the 14 PAP Town Councils, regardless of their size and population, were required to pay an equal amount of $785 per TC per month as leaseback payment for the use of the TCMS. Thus, it does not matter if you are running a small GRC like Moulmein-Kallang, or a big GRC like Ang Mo Kio. Each town pays AIM the same amount of subscription fee.",11,217,012-001-090-018-013-217,430
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"So was AIM concerned about the size and population of a town when pricing the TCMS subscription fee? The answer is obvious. And if AIM is not even worried about such business risks, why would the 14 PAP Town Councils lose sleep over this and want AIM to address such risks? After all, the PAP Town Councils have assessed that AIM is a company with an established track record in TCs and IT services, and they have confidence that the company would deliver on its commitments.",12,218,012-001-090-018-013-218,431
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Third, the above explanation of the termination clause sounds even more ludicrous when one finds out that there is a clause in the same contract that allows for variation and AIM will be paid in accordance to a method of calculation based on industry practice. In short, AIM is covered in material changes in size and population of the Town Council if it were to happen for whatever reason. So why was there a need to give AIM the absolute discretion to cite material changes to terminate its services to a Town Council where material changes were already covered under the variation clause? Can the Minister explain this anomaly?",13,219,012-001-090-018-013-219,432
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),The provision of this one-sided termination clause in the AIM transaction makes no sense because the interests of the residents were not protected at all. Our towns are always in a constant flux of change due to the dynamics of our public and private housing schemes and the redrawing of our Electoral Boundaries. Residents should not be made to suffer unnecessarily as a result of such material change.,14,220,012-001-090-018-013-220,433
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"The one-sided termination clause has caused so much confusion that even the Minister was confused as he said earlier that the letter of 10 June 2011 sent by the interim Secretary of the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council was a request to terminate the use of the TCMS. On the contrary, the letter was a request to continue the use of the software till 31 August 2011. The TC has no power to initiate any termination based on material changes. AIM was the one which was given that power to terminate and did exercise it 12 days later, on 22 June 2011, according to its own timeline. They set the termination date as 1 August 2011. The question is  why PAP TC allowed Town Councils to be powerless and at the mercy of AIM?",15,221,012-001-090-018-013-221,434
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"Next, I want to talk about the sale of the intellectual property rights. The Review Report has also concluded that the AIM transaction complied with the Town Council Act and financial rules. However, there is a misplaced trust that the sale of the IP of the software to a PAP-owned company was done in the best interest of the residents. Would any Member in this House want to spend $23.8 million of your residents' money to develop a vital piece of software and then offload the IP to a third party company knowing very well that future developments and upgrades of their system may depend on the use of the original IP rights?",16,222,012-001-090-018-013-222,435
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"The risks of system obsolescence are common problems faced by people or companies who depend a lot on the use of IT in their operations. Thus, everything from software to hardware can be rendered obsolete in a short space of time but the IP would not. The knowledge system that went into developing the IP for the $23.8 million TCMS is valuable and critical. The TCMS may have zero book value but its real operational value is immeasurable. Right at this moment as we debate in this Parliament, the TCMS is keeping almost the entire Singapore humming along, processing payments, managing arrears, handling residents' feedback and facilities booking, keeping the financial in check, keeping the communications flowing and more. The rights to use the TCMS must remain open to a Town Council no matter what or when material changes take place.",17,223,012-001-090-018-013-223,436
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"In the interest of the public, can the Minister state who will own the IP rights to the $17.6 million third-generation TCMS that is currently being developed NEC Asia Pacific? Will AIM be holding any IP rights direct or derivative to the new system that is being developed and funded with Town Council money?",18,224,012-001-090-018-013-224,437
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"The official explanation of the sale of the TCMS to AIM was to consolidate the IP rights under a single entity for ease of management, future development and securing extension of the NCS contract at no extra cost to the PAP Town Council until such time when the current system is replaced. As AIM outsourced its IT services to other vendors, it is basically playing the role of a project manager. And project managers do not need to own the IP rights to the project they manage especially when those projects are vital to the operation of our towns and developed with public money. It also appears incredulous that the 14 PAP Town Councils would need an external company who is technically a competitor of NCS to help them negotiate and secure extension of the NCS contract at no extra cost to the PAP Town Council even though the Town Council has a long standing working relationship with NCS going back to 2003 when it first awarded the multi-million dollar project to the IT company.",19,225,012-001-090-018-013-225,438

2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang),"The relationship between the PAP Town Council and AIM is an uneasy one. It was reported that AIM was set up by the PAP in 1991 to specifically support PAP MPs in the running of their TCs and estates. The company does not seek to make profit from its work done for the PAP Town Council and only charges management fee based on cost recovery.

So how should MND classify the sale of the TCMS to AIM, and the provision of the one-sided termination clause in this Review? Business or political?",22,228,012-001-090-018-013-228,441

This can give impetus to grassroots democracy, enabling more people to serve while also nurturing greater ownership among residents. Thick engagement, through involvement in decision-making on matters that affect a resident's sense of well-being vis-a-vis his estate, are necessary if local government is to be authentic, inclusive, and consequential. This helps get us to get to the substance of what Town Councils are about. Local government or decentralisation has been very much stunted so far.

The Town Councils Act or the TCs Act was set up to legally empower elected MPs representing their respective political parties to run their towns. The Act allowed not only freedom in appointing Town Councillors and staff; it does not prohibit transactions with persons or entities associated with the respective political parties.,9,303,012-001-090-018-013-303,516

It stretches and shows up the bandwidth and responsiveness of the MPs one elects. Resources are put in the hands of the respective MPs.

When we opened the tender, we received one bid and we are very confident that AIM, which is fully backed up by the PAP, can deliver.",3,353,012-001-090-018-013-353,566
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Dr Teo Ho Pin,"The second clarification is  why the one-month termination clause? The reasons are  first, we want to be fair to the tenderer because it is a balance of risk and pricing. Secondly, we want to get a better deal for the Town Councils because of the pricing and the TCMS extension at no extra cost. By the way, the one-month extension or termination clause applies to all TCs irrespective of their political affiliations.",4,354,012-001-090-018-013-354,567

There is no wastage of public funds because the whole AIM transaction has helped the PAP Town Councils first, to recover the residual value of the obsolete TCMS. Secondly, to secure extension of the TCMS at no extra cost. And thirdly, to make a better decision to develop a new TCMS suitable to the TCs.",6,356,012-001-090-018-013-356,569

This is because the fee is for the right to use TCMS so it applies equally to all the 14 TCs. Secondly, the $16.8 million NEC contract is based a service model so the TCs do not own this software.",7,357,012-001-090-018-013-357,570

2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Ms Sylvia Lim,"  Yes, Madam. I would like the Member to clarify what he just said. He mentioned that the termination clause in the contract of one month applies equally to Town Councils regardless of which party runs it. But I wonder if he can explain what he understands by material changes to the membership of the Town Council. That is one. And secondly, did AIM terminate any other Town Council under this clause?",1,359,012-001-090-018-013-359,572
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Dr Teo Ho Pin,"  As I mentioned, the termination clause applies to all Town Councils. As to the material change, it all depends on the substance of the change. That is the reason why it is mentioned there to be fair to the bidder, when there is a material change, they have this right to exercise it. But it is up to the bidder to exercise the right. As I mentioned -- why is it there -- it is because we want to balance the risk and the pricing of the tender.",1,360,012-001-090-018-013-360,573

Ms Sylvia Lim would be familiar with this because she exercised this latitude when her Town Council waived competition and appointed FM Solutions and Services Pte Ltd (FMSS) as their Managing Agent in 2011.

The Act by design does not prohibit transactions between the Town Council and party-related entities or persons. Latitude has always been given to MPs to manage their Town Councils according to their best judgement and be accountable to their residents politically. Town Councils run by MPs from all political parties have at one time or another appointed party supporters or former candidates to provide services to the Town Councils they run.

As I mentioned, the Town Councils Act presently does not prohibit transactions with party affiliates. However, if we choose to do this as what Mr Pritam Singh has proposed, then we must impose it across all Town Councils, and also not just narrowly on party-owned companies but companies owned by people in various forms of party affiliations, like ex-party members and party supporters and even their immediate families.",15,379,012-001-090-018-013-379,592

Ms Sylvia Lim, of course, has been spreading this narrative ever since MND found her Town Council to be lacking in performance. She asked essentially  why should the Town Councils pass the ownership of an essential software to AIM only to lease it back at a fee from AIM? The Review Report has given a detailed explanation for this arrangement. This was a sale and leaseback arrangement which is perfectly normal in the industry. Just because at the end of it, the software has been transferred to AIM does not mean that it is at all improper.",26,390,012-001-090-018-013-390,603
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Now, why did the PAP Town Councils do so, just when the software was nearing obsolescence? Precisely because the software would soon be obsolescent, the Town Councils needed to move onto next generation software. Centralising the software ownership in one entity so that the latter could negotiate with potential vendors as one would greatly facilitate the process. But as the Town Councils needed to continue to function, the Town Councils would still need to make use of the software. The sale and leaseback arrangement was a practical solution to this problem.",27,391,012-001-090-018-013-391,604
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Moreover, as new generation software would need time to develop, the Town Councils would also need the NCS to continue to maintain the system in the meantime.

I accept the point that, in general, the fact that a company had just $2 of paid-up capital must raise a flag and need to be considered. But in this case, AIM is not an ordinary $2 company. It was set up by the PAP specifically years ago to help its PAP MPs do a better job at running their Town Councils. The party was standing behind it, effectively guaranteeing its performance. Moreover, there was a track record as it was responsible for the earlier version of the Town Councils' management software. That is the difference between AIM and any other ""$2 company"" that gave the PAP Town Councils confidence to enter into this contract with AIM.",31,395,012-001-090-018-013-395,608
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"And as it turned out, did AIM perform as required? Yes, AIM performed its duties successfully. First, centralising the software did not cost the Town Councils any extra money. Second, AIM has helped the Town Councils to extend the NCS software maintenance contract at no increased cost in the past 18 months. This has saved money for Town Councils, and hence their residents. Third, AIM has got the Town Councils onto a new generation software to be developed by NEC under a new leasing arrangement. This was a major objective of the Town Councils when they called the 2010 tender to sell-and-lease-back their obsolescent software. This necessary task has now been fully completed. The Town Councils have benefited from the AIM services.",32,396,012-001-090-018-013-396,609
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,Ms Sylvia Lim further suggested that the timing of the sale of the TCMS to AIM just before the 2011 GE shows that the transaction was politically motivated.

2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Second, software becomes obsolescent with time as the hardware and software platforms on which it is written are regularly upgraded. Those of us who have to deal with software installations and software platforms, we know that. The Town Councils knew that their software which had been developed in 2003, and built upon Windows XP and Oracle Financial 11 platforms, would have to be upgraded to the next generation soon. D&T confirmed it after conducting the review. Windows XP had been superseded, in fact, two generations, by Windows Vista and Windows 7. Worse, Oracle would also soon phase out its Financial 11 platform. They therefore recommended a software leasing arrangement for the Town Councils to consider, in line with the general industry practice.",35,399,012-001-090-018-013-399,612

2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Ms Sylvia Lim further argued that the residents' interests were placed at risk by AIM's one-sided termination clause. Now, all commercial contracts come with a termination clause. Termination can be initiated by both sides after observing a period of notice. The question is  is it one-sided? The Review Team has studied the specific termination clause in question and noted in its report that the Town Councils had valid reasons to insert it. The AIM contract is a lump-sum contract and a termination clause to address material changes to the scope and duties of the Town Council will help reduce the vendor's business risk and hopefully fetch a better price.",37,401,012-001-090-018-013-401,614
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"There are now two interpretations of what actually happened. AIM insisted that it did not initiate the termination and that it was the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council which gave notice of its intention to use its own software. Only on receipt of that notice did AIM then terminate the contract. The AH Town Council's version is that they believed that it would be terminated and so decided to start sourcing for their own IT software system. The Review Team has included the full exchange of letters in their report, and we will let the readers draw their own conclusions.",38,402,012-001-090-018-013-402,615

Why would we want to deliberately disrupt the lives of residents in Aljunied? Would the WP just keep quiet and not make a political issue out of it? Who then would get the blame? Why would the PAP want to hurt the interests of residents in Aljunied and alienate them? How could we hope to regain Aljunied if we did this?",40,404,012-001-090-018-013-404,617

No way. I think they will start pointing fingers at everybody else. So when Ms Sylvia Lim says that the AIM transaction shows that the PAP is hurting the people in Aljunied as just ""collateral damage in a bigger political game"", I am disappointed at such a comment. What is our bigger political game? It is about winning back Aljunied, not about doing something petty that will just upset everybody and make us lose Aljunied permanently.",42,406,012-001-090-018-013-406,619
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Indeed, who has been playing politics with this AIM transaction? If Ms Sylvia Lim was really concerned about the termination of the contract by AIM, why did she not simply write a letter to AIM asking for extension rather than assume that it would not be acceded to? And as events demonstrated, AIM readily acceded to her subsequent requests for extensions, not once but twice. Maybe pride or political motives got in the way, and residents' interests became secondary.",43,407,012-001-090-018-013-407,620
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Please take a good look at Mr Sitoh who dealt with a similar transitional problem in Potong Pasir. He did not feel anything wrong to ask for an extension of the service of the General Manager who had served for many years under Mr Chiam See Tong. He placed residents' interests first, and because he ventured to ask, he ensured a successful transition and handing over at Potong Pasir. The transition there was not without problems; there were many. But instead of bad-mouthing or finding excuses through attributing problems to his predecessor, he and his team worked quietly round-the-clock to minimise any disruption to their residents. That is the professional way of dealing with handing over.",44,408,012-001-090-018-013-408,621
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"If there is anything suspicious about timing, it is really the timing of Ms Sylvia Lim raising the AIM issue. Why did she not raise the termination of the TCMS back in 2011 when they took over, instead of thanking AIM for agreeing to the extensions that they had requested. Why, after thanking AIM, then wait 18 months till December 2012 when the MND revealed that the Town Council's audit report had been delayed, to raise this complaint against AIM? I presume she will claim that they had been too busy setting up their own system to bother about raising this issue. Anyway, I must say it has been quite effective in distracting the public from the actual situation in the Town Council.",45,409,012-001-090-018-013-409,622
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Ms Sylvia Lim has also questioned the prudence in incurring unnecessary expenditure during handovers to replicate systems already developed with public funds, when these systems could simply be handed over to MPs taking over. I agree that Town Councils should not incur unnecessary expenditure, whether during handovers or for day-to-day operations as these are residents' funds. That is why during a handover, contracts, assets and liabilities remain vested with the Town Council. They are accessible to the newly elected MPs when they take over. It is not necessary for the new Town Council management to terminate the existing contracts and incur additional costs to replicate existing systems unless they choose to.",46,410,012-001-090-018-013-410,623
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"However, software contracts have unique difficulties with such an arrangement. There have to be significant software changes when boundaries are changed. This happens with Town Councils even when the political party remains unchanged. Where political parties change, the operating software inevitably has to evolve to suit the new MP's management style and operational preference. As Mr Zainal Sapari put it just now, ""the reality is that there will be cost incurred whenever there is a change of Town Council and which can be significant"". But I agree that we should try to minimise it, and this requires some give-and-take on the part of the two parties involved in the changeover.",47,411,012-001-090-018-013-411,624

The then Health Minister Mr Goh appointed me to start up a newly built hospital. The hospital was almost built, and the deadline to open the hospital already announced to the public. My team had to start it up. We were given – relying on my memory -- four or five months to start it up.",49,413,012-001-090-018-013-413,626
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-013,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"One of the things that was missing at that time was software. To run a hospital, you need computer software. Yes, if you do not have one software, it is very hard to run a hospital properly, and to do it manually, that is impossible. But we managed it in four, five months. How? Because the software industry is very well developed. There are off-the-shelf software programmes which you can pick and buy, and then you just have to design your operational processes to suit the software, to be in accordance with the software. So that is one quick and easy option, and that was the option I did in the case of NUH; successfully opened. But if you want bells and whistles, then of course, you have to spend time developing, modifying, changing the software codes; so it cannot be an off-the-shelf solution. In the case of NUH, we started with off-the-shelf solution, settled in, got the priorities right. And then over time, we added in all the bells and whistles, and then we had a very sophisticated software when I left the hospital.",50,414,012-001-090-018-013-414,627

It is up to you. But in any case, the bottom line is this – AIM did not terminate. They were quite willing to extend, if only you asked. But if you do not ask, why should they offer, because you may feel insulted.",51,415,012-001-090-018-013-415,628

But by the time it was hitting obsolescence, how much was it worth? Very little; nothing; probably zero. And the tender bids proved it. Nobody was interested in it. AIM had to step in, because if they did not step in, the Town Councils would be left in the lurch, which was the point that Asst Prof Eugene Tan made in his TODAY article on 6 May.",53,417,012-001-090-018-013-417,630

To be precise, when it was under Mr George Yeo, it was $6.51 per housing unit per month. Now, it is $7.87 in Financial Year 2011, in the first contract. And then up to $8.04 per unit per month now – 20% hike. In fact, FMSS' rate is more than 50% higher than the rate charged in Tampines Town Council, which is of similar size. Tampines' rate is about $5.15 per month per unit. In fact, it came down a little bit to $4.99 last year.

Hence, all contracts, including the managing agent contract, are transferred and the previous managing agent (MA) can continue to run the Town Council while the new management team eases in.

As I was saying, residents in Opposition wards are not excluded from selection of upgrading programmes, whether it is HIP or NRP. When selecting projects, MND will try to spread out the projects among the wards and the Town Councils. Priority is always given to older blocks. Within each town, we also give weight to the Town Council's ranking of projects. Ms Sylvia Lim will know that this year, her Town Council has been given three upgrading projects – two HIPs and one NRP. No Town Councils have more than three projects. My own Town Council has only one project. In accordance with the Town Council's priority ranking, two of these projects are in Hougang and one in Aljunied.",1,1,012-001-090-018-016-001,646

There is no new information or new argument that they have not considered before they drew the conclusions and wrote their Report. In the process, they have pointed out some lacunae in our current Town Councils Rules and recommended a review of Town Councils. This has given this House the opportunity to revisit the origin of Town Councils and our roles and responsibilities as MPs and as Town Councillors.

And, of course, as he knows, under the rules, there is a provision to do so provided that you satisfy the conditions for the waiver. At that time, the reasons were recorded accordingly as in there was urgency in the public interest and, in large part, due to the termination clause present for the TCMS to be cut off.

Now, we realise our duties when dealing with a sole tenderer that we need to ensure value for money for our residents. So, in actual fact, we went through some due diligence and actually commissioned a special audit of that tender award.

So the point being made there was about software companies  how many software companies really have all the directors having Town Council experience.

I can name them as a fact  Esmaco, EM Services, CPG. We knew at that point in time that all these companies have contracts with PAP Town Councils.

2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-016,Ms Sylvia Lim,"So it is with that landscape that we had to make a certain decision to find an MA willing to work with us in the Town Council. The set-up of FMSS was because of this very real possibility that we will be faced with nobody else to do it for us. And we stand by that to say that we acted in our residents' interest to ensure continuity because of this landscape. I am not sure why the Members in the House are laughing because I think, perhaps, they have not been in this position as we have but these are the facts.",8,19,012-001-090-018-016-019,664
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-016,Ms Sylvia Lim,"Now, the next clarification which I should repeat is that FMSS shareholders and directors are not WP members at all. So it is very different from AIM. As Member Denise Phua pointed out, it is not really a parallel to draw that comparison.",9,20,012-001-090-018-016-020,665
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-016,Ms Sylvia Lim,"The seventh point is, I wonder whether Minister con confirm his personal view about whether a termination of one month's notice for a critical IT system is reasonable. How does that not jeopardise residents' interest when you have that such clause. I would like his personal view on that.",10,21,012-001-090-018-016-021,666
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-016,Ms Sylvia Lim,"The last clarification for now is that he mentioned, as some others have mentioned, that we are raising this issue of AIM as an excuse for our poor performance or alleged poor performance under the TCMR. He is asking why we did not raise it earlier when we knew of it earlier. As he well knows, and I have stated this publicly in the past, one reason was that we needed to take over and it is true we were busy with that, but the second thing is also that we needed the public to see the sting of the clause before they can understand how it can jeopardise the handover. So, it is a question of when it is appropriate to raise it. So these are my clarifications for now, Madam.",11,22,012-001-090-018-016-022,667

2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-016,Mr Pritam Singh,"  Mdm Speaker, it was helpful to learn of all these revelations about FMSS here in this House. It would actually be quite useful to know revelations about PAP-owned companies, how many PAP-owned companies there are in Singapore, what business do they do? This is a piece of information that a lot of Singaporeans are very curious about. That has not been answered.",1,26,012-001-090-018-016-026,671
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-016,Mr Pritam Singh,"I am not sure whether this is the appropriate forum for it but the key instance here is, FMSS is not a WP-owned company and I think that is the point that we are stressing to the public.",2,27,012-001-090-018-016-027,672
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-016,Mr Pritam Singh,"The second point I would like to make in regard to this issue is the final point I made before I ended off my speech which is, in so far as the strategic review of TCs are concerned, MND should really look at directing companies fully owned by political parties not having any business dealing with Town Councils. I understand that Minister extended that to say party supporters also but that would make it really hazy because everybody goes to the polls. Somebody votes for PAP; somebody votes for WP. Nobody will be able to bid for a TC contract under that definition. So what we are saying is political parties should be removed from having business dealings with TCs. And let us be open about it, let us be completely transparent. Both parties, PAP, WP, everybody, any party that contests. That is the first point. And I think we really have not got that assurance yet.",3,28,012-001-090-018-016-028,673
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-016,Mr Pritam Singh,"Second point I would like to make is with regards to some of these numbers that were going around. Well, before the WP won, the Aljunied Town Council under the leadership of George Yeo, that Town Council has the highest S&CC rates in addition to one other PAP Town Council, of any Town Council all over Singapore. The numbers ought to be looked at in a different perspective. There are other ways of looking at how much value residents are getting for their dollar. But in so far as we are concerned, Aljunied, Hougang, Punggol East Town Councils with FMSS at the helm, we will make sure that residents actually get full value for their dollar. And that is our assurance to them and we will serve them to the best of our abilities.",4,29,012-001-090-018-016-029,674
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-016,Mr Khaw Boon Wan," Mdm Speaker, the point about S&CC is precisely one of those great concerns of MND because when Town Councils for political reasons wanting to be populist and reduce fees or set low fees when they are not appropriate, they are sacrificing long-term financial viability of the Town Councils. So that is one point.",1,30,012-001-090-018-016-030,675
2013-05-13,Town Councils,012-001-090-018-016,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The second point is, Mr Pritam Singh, of course, wants to define party affiliation narrowly which I disagree. We are the policy owners and we have good reasons to define party affiliation; why they cannot be so narrow as just ""party-owned"". And FMSS shareholders are not ordinary Singaporeans. Mr Pritam Singh said by widening this definition now, it covers the whole of Singapore. It does not. They are strong, clearly long-term supporters of the Workers' Party.",2,31,012-001-090-018-016-031,676

If you want, there are standard software programmes available in the market. So, indeed, if it is one month, there are available software programmes which you can buy into.

The $15,000 minimum insurance requirement covered an average of 98% of FDW medical bills from 2010 to 2012, and continues to provide a reasonable level of protection for employers, at affordable premiums. The incidence of FDWs requiring hospitalisation care remains low.

2013-05-13,Conversion of Military Driving Licences into Civilian Licences,012-001-090-018-022,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"A set of conversion criteria is necessary in view of the different requirements and operating environments faced by SAF drivers and civilian drivers. For instance, SAF’s military licensing regime trains servicemen to be competent in driving military vehicles in an operational environment, usually across off-road terrain, whereas TP’s civilian licensing regime trains drivers to meet the demands of general motoring on Singapore’s roads.",2,3,012-001-090-018-022-003,728
2013-05-13,Conversion of Military Driving Licences into Civilian Licences,012-001-090-018-022,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Given the different needs, servicemen who do not fulfil the conversion criteria have to be further assessed through TP’s driving tests before they can qualify for civilian licences.",3,4,012-001-090-018-022-004,729
2013-05-13,Improving Productivity in Public Sector,012-001-090-018-023,Mrs Lina Chiam,asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance how is the Public Service Division taking the lead in increasing productivity within the Public Sector.,1,1,012-001-090-018-023-001,730
2013-05-13,Improving Productivity in Public Sector,012-001-090-018-023,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"  Productivity is an important objective in public services. However, most governments find it difficult to measure productivity accurately in public services, as the value created from such services is often intangible and not easily quantified. For example, putting additional teachers in a school to provide a well-rounded education may be desirable, but the value imparted to the students is not easily measured. It would clearly be wrong to conclude that having more teachers for the same number of students graduating means a reduction in productivity.",1,2,012-001-090-018-023-002,731
2013-05-13,Improving Productivity in Public Sector,012-001-090-018-023,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"It is therefore a challenge to define or measure public sector productivity in the same way as the private sector. Nevertheless, the Public Service has always been committed to the efficient delivery of better services to our citizens.",2,3,012-001-090-018-023-003,732
2013-05-13,Improving Productivity in Public Sector,012-001-090-018-023,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"One indication of this is the fact that the public sector’s share of the total labour force in Singapore is one of the lowest internationally. Its 3.6% share in Singapore is close to that in Hong Kong (4%) and lower than in countries like New Zealand (7%) and the UK (12%) -- in all these cases, the numbers exclude teachers and defence personnel.",3,4,012-001-090-018-023-004,733
2013-05-13,Improving Productivity in Public Sector,012-001-090-018-023,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,We are however continually seeking improvements in efficiency in the Public Service. I will highlight four key areas to illustrate how this is being done.,4,5,012-001-090-018-023-005,734
2013-05-13,Improving Productivity in Public Sector,012-001-090-018-023,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"First, through the use of IT and automation. We are seen internationally as amongst the leaders in the use of IT to improve delivery of public services. As a recent example, with effect from 1 April 2013, Singaporeans who have successfully applied for passports may now collect them from ICA’s self-service machine, iCollect. This initiative not only makes it easier for customers to collect their passports, but also enables ICA to expand its service capacity without additional manpower.",5,6,012-001-090-018-023-006,735
2013-05-13,Improving Productivity in Public Sector,012-001-090-018-023,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Second, the Public Service is driving productivity gains through organizational efficiency. For example, the newly formed Department of Public Cleanliness at NEA has consolidated public cleanliness responsibilities for the entire Public Service. This initiative will enable the Government to reap economies of scale in the procurement and administration of cleaning services, and achieve better productivity in public cleanliness.",6,7,012-001-090-018-023-007,736
2013-05-13,Improving Productivity in Public Sector,012-001-090-018-023,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Third, we invest in the training and upgrading of public sector officers. All civil servants are required to take part in regular training to sharpen their skills and to expose them to better ways of working. The Civil Service College, which is the training arm of the Civil Service, constantly reviews its curriculum and training programmes to ensure relevance, and seeks to bring in good trainers and course providers, to help our officers improve.",7,8,012-001-090-018-023-008,737
2013-05-13,Improving Productivity in Public Sector,012-001-090-018-023,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Finally, in addition to these initiatives, the Ministry of Finance has in place a Manpower Management Framework to constrain the growth of manpower in the Public Sector. This framework provides Ministries with the incentive to moderate headcount growth, except where necessary to deliver better value.",8,9,012-001-090-018-023-009,738
2013-05-13,Improving Productivity in Public Sector,012-001-090-018-023,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"Taken in totality, these four thrusts will continue to increase productivity in the Public Sector, and aligns the Public Service to our national objective of improving productivity.",9,10,012-001-090-018-023-010,739
2013-05-13,Funds for Youth Expedition Project Scheme,012-001-090-018-024,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"asked the Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) what percentage of the funds allocated by the National Youth Council to subsidise the Youth Expedition Project (YEP) are utilised over the past five years; (b) how many YEPs have been supported through these funds over the past five years; and (c) whether more funds will be allocated for such projects in the future.",1,1,012-001-090-018-024-001,740
2013-05-13,Funds for Youth Expedition Project Scheme,012-001-090-018-024,Mr Lawrence Wong,  The Youth Expedition Project (YEP) is a flagship programme of the National Youth Council (NYC). It aims to nurture socially responsible youths who contribute to the community both at home and abroad.,1,2,012-001-090-018-024-002,741
2013-05-13,Funds for Youth Expedition Project Scheme,012-001-090-018-024,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Over the past five years, NYC has utilised around 95% of the funds allocated to the YEP programme. This has supported around 900 Youth Expedition Projects, benefitting over 1700 youth leaders and 18,000 youths. There has been strong demand for the YEP, and an average of 40 more projects have been supported every year.",2,3,012-001-090-018-024-003,742
2013-05-13,Funds for Youth Expedition Project Scheme,012-001-090-018-024,Mr Lawrence Wong,"With the establishment of the National Youth Fund, MCCY and NYC will review whether more funds can be allocated to support the YEP so that this meaningful programme can be made accessible to more youths.",3,4,012-001-090-018-024-004,743
2013-05-13,Defence Equipment Installed on HDB Blocks,012-001-090-018-025,Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene,"asked the Minister for Defence (a) whether defence equipment, such as radar, are installed on HDB blocks and, if so, what are the reasons for doing so; (b) how are public health, safety and security concerns managed and mitigated; and (c) whether these installations pose an added danger to HDB residents during times of military conflict.",1,1,012-001-090-018-025-001,744
2013-05-13,Defence Equipment Installed on HDB Blocks,012-001-090-018-025,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"  There are less than a handful of defence equipment installed on HDB blocks as part of SAF’s surveillance network to ensure Singapore’s security. These were sited only after all other viable alternatives had been exhausted. These equipment pose no adverse effects on health of individuals as they keep well within international norms and standards required by local agencies. In fact, the measured levels are similar to base stations for mobile phones that have been set up by commercial telcos across the island.",1,2,012-001-090-018-025-002,745

2013-05-13,Import of Pigs from China,012-001-090-018-026,Ms Foo Mee Har,"asked the Minister for National Development to what extent does Singapore depend on China for the import of pigs and whether the recent incident of more than 16,000 putrefying pigs in the Huangpu River presents a threat to our food security.",1,1,012-001-090-018-026-001,747
2013-05-13,Import of Pigs from China,012-001-090-018-026,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"  Our pork supply consists of live pigs, chilled and frozen pork. Singapore does not import live pigs or chilled pork from China. As for frozen pork, we import most of it from Brazil and the Netherlands. Frozen pork imports from China make up 1.6% of our total frozen pork imports.",1,2,012-001-090-018-026-002,748
2013-05-13,Import of Pigs from China,012-001-090-018-026,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,Our other pork imports from China are in the form of canned pork and luncheon pork. Such processed pork has undergone proper heat treatment processes to kill any dangerous micro-organisms.,2,3,012-001-090-018-026-003,749
2013-05-13,Import of Pigs from China,012-001-090-018-026,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The incident of putrefying pigs in the Huangpu River does not pose a threat to our food security or food safety. The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA)’s integrated food safety system ensures that all pork imports come only from sources which are approved by AVA. In addition, AVA has strict requirements for all its accredited pork processing plants to receive their raw materials only from AVA’s approved sources.",3,4,012-001-090-018-026-004,750
2013-05-13,Update on Used Cars Industry,012-001-090-018-027,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"asked the Minister for Transport (a) what was the average monthly number of used car transactions six months before the financial curb was implemented on 25 February 2013; (b) till 7 May 2013, how many of the 7,000 used cars which were in stock before the financial curb have been sold after the restriction was temporarily lifted for 60 days from 6 April 2013; and (c) how many new cars have been bought by the physically disabled or their caregivers that are exempted from the loan curb.",1,1,012-001-090-018-027-001,751
2013-05-13,Update on Used Cars Industry,012-001-090-018-027,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"  From August 2012 to January 2013, about 5,000 used cars were sold monthly, based on the data of cars that were transferred from motor vehicle dealers to buyers via the Land Transport Authority’s Temporary Transfer Scheme (TTS).",1,2,012-001-090-018-027-002,752

2013-05-13,Preparing MRT Stations for Larger Passenger Capacity,012-001-090-018-028,Dr Janil Puthucheary,asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether future MRT lines will have the potential to serve longer trains; (b) to what extent will future-proofing be incorporated into the designs of new MRT lines and stations; and (c) whether such an approach can be taken with existing MRT stations to improve carrying capacity.,1,1,012-001-090-018-028-001,755
2013-05-13,Preparing MRT Stations for Larger Passenger Capacity,012-001-090-018-028,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"  In planning the capacity of future MRT lines and stations, various factors are considered, in particular travel patterns resulting from population projections, the geographical distribution of residences and employment, and the utilisation rate of public transport. Buffer capacity is then provided, through procuring more trains than is required in the initial years, and preparing plans in advance to buy more trains to scale up capacity according to demand. For the future lines which LTA is currently planning, we will also be studying the feasibility of building the lines and the stations to be able to accommodate longer trains than what may be needed in the initial years, to provide additional buffer capacity. However, at the same time, we have to balance this wish for buffer capacity against trade-offs like higher costs, and the opportunity cost of greater land-take.",1,2,012-001-090-018-028-002,756
2013-05-13,Preparing MRT Stations for Larger Passenger Capacity,012-001-090-018-028,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"For existing lines, it is difficult and very complex to expand MRT stations to accommodate longer trains. Amongst others, we will likely need to acquire additional land around the stations. Even if this were possible, modifying the stations would require significant engineering works, and likely involve shutting down existing station operations for extended durations.",2,3,012-001-090-018-028-003,757
2013-05-13,Preparing MRT Stations for Larger Passenger Capacity,012-001-090-018-028,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"For existing high traffic stations, LTA will instead implement enhancement works where we can to improve the circulation and distribution of passengers, such as providing more entry and exit points, and more platform space.",3,4,012-001-090-018-028-004,758
2013-05-13,Dialysis Centres in New Towns,012-001-090-018-029,Dr Janil Puthucheary,asked the Minister for Health (a) how does the Ministry intend to facilitate the provision and development of dialysis centres in new towns such as Punggol; and (b) to what extent has the Ministry planned for the local community provision of future chronic healthcare needs of these citizens.,1,1,012-001-090-018-029-001,759
2013-05-13,Dialysis Centres in New Towns,012-001-090-018-029,Mr Gan Kim Yong,  Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) play a key role in the provision of dialysis services in the community. MOH has been assisting the VWOs such as the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) in identifying suitable sites in areas where there is a need for such services and in facilitating discussions with relevant authorities to secure these sites.,1,2,012-001-090-018-029-002,760
2013-05-13,Dialysis Centres in New Towns,012-001-090-018-029,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"My Ministry will continue to monitor the demand for dialysis centres, including in new towns such as Punggol. Besides ensuring sufficient capacity for haemodialysis, we are also working with the VWOs and renal physicians to improve the access of peritoneal dialysis for suitable patients who can enjoy a more active lifestyle with this modality of dialysis.",2,3,012-001-090-018-029-003,761
2013-05-13,Dialysis Centres in New Towns,012-001-090-018-029,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The Government also supports VWO providers’ efforts to raise funds so as to help reduce patient bills. For example, the $1 billion Community Silver Trust (CST) provides dollar-for-dollar matching grants for funds raised by VWOs providing intermediate and long-term care services, such as NKF. In addition to the CST, Government also provides operating subvention to help defray VWOs’ operating costs for providing dialysis service and lower the cost to patients. We have recently increased our subvention to enhance the support for VWO providers.",3,4,012-001-090-018-029-004,762

2013-05-13,Singapore's Submission on Review of ASEAN Processes,012-001-090-018-030,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs),"The key strategic issue facing ASEAN is how to maintain our centrality and relevance in an increasingly complex and challenging geopolitical and economic environment. This was clearly on the minds of all the Leaders at the recent ASEAN Summit held in Brunei on 24-25 April. Since the ASEAN Charter entered into force in 2008, the world has changed immensely, and change continues at an unprecedented rate and in unpredictable ways.

A united and economically integrated ASEAN is essential if we are to hold our own in the new environment and remain an attractive partner for the major powers. ASEAN still has much to do to fulfil our goal of establishing an ASEAN Community in 2015, as well as implement the Initiative for ASEAN Integration Work Plan II, the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.

Both sides had a useful round of discussions at the ASEAN-China Senior Officials’ Consultation in Beijing on 2 April 2013, where we agreed to continue consultations on the implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the SCS (DOC), as well as on the way forward on a COC. We were encouraged by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s recent expression of China’s readiness to explore a COC with ASEAN. However, we are still at the stage of talking about talks on a COC.

2013-05-13,Singapore and ASEAN's Role in Resolving East China Sea Dispute,012-001-090-018-031,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs),"  It is our long-standing policy that territorial issues should be settled by claimant countries in a peaceful manner in accordance with international law, including UNCLOS. The question of sovereignty over the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands can only be resolved between China and Japan. Singapore and ASEAN take no position on the merits of their respective positions. However, Singapore closely watches the recent developments on the issue with some concern. China and Japan are the second and third largest economies in the world and important partners of many countries around the region including the US. Any escalation of tensions can have potentially serious ramifications on the interests of not only the countries directly involved. We hope that both sides would exercise restraint and engage in dialogue to overcome their differences, and not allow their overall bilateral ties to be held hostage by one single issue.",1,2,012-001-090-018-031-002,774
2013-05-13,Singaporeans Who Are Not Able to Benefit from MediShield,012-001-090-018-032,Mr Zaqy Mohamad,asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry will consider allowing citizens who do not qualify for MediShield coverage because of pre-existing health conditions to purchase commercial insurance using their Medisave or CPF Special Accounts; and (b) what is the current number of Singaporeans who are not able to benefit from MediShield due to the pre-existing health conditions and what are their age profiles.,1,1,012-001-090-018-032-001,775
2013-05-13,Singaporeans Who Are Not Able to Benefit from MediShield,012-001-090-018-032,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"  MediShield currently covers 92% of the resident population. Over the years, my Ministry has worked with the CPF Board to introduce various auto-cover points, including when one starts work and at birth, to bring Singaporeans under MediShield protection as early as possible, before they develop pre-existing health conditions. The number of residents who have applied but were unable to obtain MediShield coverage due to pre-existing conditions is generally very low, at less than 0.5% of residents aged 60 and below and about 1% to 2% of residents above age 60.",1,2,012-001-090-018-032-002,776

Medisave may be used for private health insurance plans that comply with MOH requirements, such as plans that are integrated with MediShield and provide guaranteed renewals, regardless of conditions that develop after coverage begins.

2013-05-13,PMETs' Vulnerability to Retrenchment,012-001-090-018-033,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"This increase was partly due to above-average incidence of redundancy for PMETs in electronics (at 21 per 1,000), financial services (14 per 1,000) and information & communications (13 per 1,000) ? industries which typically hire more PMETs.

2013-05-13,PMETs' Vulnerability to Retrenchment,012-001-090-018-033,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Even though the incidence of redundancy was higher among PMETs than non-PMETs in 2012, unemployment amongst resident PMETs remained low. The annual average unemployment rate for those with a degree stands at 2.7%, which is comparable to the overall unemployment rate of 2.8%. This is lower2 than the overall unemployment rates in comparable economies such as Hong Kong (3.3%) and South Korea (3.2%). There is likewise no significant difference between the long-term unemployment rate of those with degrees and those without3. At the same time, there are still many jobs available for PMETs.

Businesses can apply for or renew licences, check application statuses, update licences, and terminate their licences online, in one online transaction. In addition, we have also introduced various other platforms to streamline the interactions between the Government and businesses. For example, local and international suppliers can search for procurement opportunities and submit bids online through the Government’s one-stop e-procurement portal, known as GeBiz (Government Electronic Business).",1,2,012-001-090-018-037-002,802

2013-05-13,Improvements Brought about by Fort Canning Tunnel,012-001-090-018-043,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"  Let me start with a brief background on the Fort Canning Tunnel. The tunnel was first mooted when URA formulated the Civic District Master Plan for the Bras Basah area, back in 1988.",1,2,012-001-090-018-043-002,828
2013-05-13,Improvements Brought about by Fort Canning Tunnel,012-001-090-018-043,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"There was active public engagement on the plans back then, particularly on the issue of retaining the National Library building. Options to improve the transportation network in the area were carefully studied. The conclusion was that a realignment of Stamford Road and a tunnel through Fort Canning Hill was the best option to realise the Master Plan’s objective of creating a vibrant and pedestrian-friendly civic district around the Bras Basah area. The tunnel would provide the most direct link for traffic from Marina Centre and the Central Business District to Orchard Road, and in turn siphon traffic away from the Bras Basah area, making it more pleasant for pedestrians.",2,3,012-001-090-018-043-003,829
2013-05-13,Improvements Brought about by Fort Canning Tunnel,012-001-090-018-043,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Therefore, the Fort Canning Tunnel was not justified by traffic benefits alone, but to realize other benefits for the public and in optimising land use for the area. When constructing the tunnel, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) chose the method of tunneling that would cause the least disturbance to the surroundings and saved about 35 trees, including an iconic 50-year old Terap tree.",3,4,012-001-090-018-043-004,830
2013-05-13,Improvements Brought about by Fort Canning Tunnel,012-001-090-018-043,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"Since its opening in January 2007, the Fort Canning Tunnel has served its objectives. Traffic has been diverted from Stamford Road, and public buses can now ply smoothly with minimal delays at junctions. With the narrowing of Stamford Road from four to three lanes, pedestrians too have a better walking experience in the area.",4,5,012-001-090-018-043-005,831
2013-05-13,Improvements Brought about by Fort Canning Tunnel,012-001-090-018-043,Mr Lui Tuck Yew,"It is difficult, if not impossible, to attach a dollar value to heritage landmarks and national icons when evaluating the costs and benefits of a project. We are mindful to adopt a balanced approach by taking into consideration both the tangible and intangible aspects of projects. Decisions are not made on monetary costs and benefits alone. The preservation of heritage landmarks and national icons has always been an important consideration in our planning process, and will continue to be so going forward.",5,6,012-001-090-018-043-006,832

These included additional exclusive turning lanes for traffic turning into different parts of the Hub, extended bus bay and junction widening at Commonwealth Avenue West/Clementi Ave 3. LTA has also stepped up enforcement against illegal parking and waiting, especially around the bus bay next to the MRT station.

2013-05-13,Part-Time Workers Seeking Flexible Work,012-001-090-018-053,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"  The Government already has schemes in place to help SMEs tap on part-time workers today. For example, SPRING has implemented a part-time pool programme for the Retail and Food Services sectors, which encourages SMEs to adopt flexible staffing models and integrate part-timers into their workforce. Under the programme, appointed service providers recruit and deploy a pool of trained part-timers for companies to tap on. This pool includes students and previously economically inactive matured workers. The industry associations, namely the Singapore Retailers Association (SRA) and the Restaurant Association of Singapore (RAS), train the part-timers with WSQ accredited training. To date, more than 120 companies and more than 3,000 part-timers have joined the programme. The Hotels sector has a similar part-time pool programme, driven by the Singapore Hotels Association (SHA). We would encourage industry associations to play an active role in developing such part-time pool initiatives if their sectors have similar needs for part-time workers.",1,2,012-001-090-018-053-002,873

We are aware that some employers, especially SMEs, face challenges in implementing flexible work arrangements. Hence, we launched WorkPro this year to help employers put in place flexible work arrangements, and tap on local mature workers and those who wish to return to the workforce. The Work-Life Grant under WorkPro provides funding support of up to $160,000 per company for the implementation of work-life strategies, particularly flexible work arrangements, to help employers attract and retain employees.

2013-05-13,Investigation and Enforcement Powers for Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices,012-001-090-018-054,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"  The Tripartite Alliance on Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP) was set up in 2006 as a promotional body. Leveraging on its unique tripartite identity, TAFEP works in partnership with employer organisations, unions and the government to create awareness and facilitate the adoption of fair, responsible and merit-based employment practices. TAFEP has made good progress – employers are today more aware of what it means to have fair employment practices and the number of employers who have signed the Employer’s Pledge of Fair Employment has more than trebled, from about 600 in 2007 to more than 2000 in 2012.",1,2,012-001-090-018-054-002,876

This consultation is free and TAFEP will follow up to contact the employer where there is a possible case of discrimination. Most employers whom TAFEP had engaged in the past on such complaints were cooperative and took active steps to rectify their discriminatory practices. In some instances, TAFEP may also suggest relevant training for the employers to assist them in adopting fair employment practices.",2,3,012-001-090-018-054-003,877

He had said then that the Government expects all employers doing business in Singapore to comply with the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices. While TAFEP as a promotional body does not have the powers to enforce these practices, MOM will step in and investigate complaints surfaced by TAFEP where prima facie evidence suggests that there are discriminatory hiring practices at play.

2013-05-13,Senior Citizens Performing Physically Demanding Jobs,012-001-090-018-064,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"  MOM does not define and categorise jobs by whether they are physically demanding or not, nor find it practical to do so. The nature of jobs varies across industries and companies, even for jobs with the same title. In June 2012, 45% of resident workers aged 60 and over worked in the category of Production & Transport Operators, Cleaners & Labourers or related occupations, which generally tend to consist of jobs that may be comparatively more physically demanding. This is due in part to the lower educational profile of our older workers.",1,2,012-001-090-018-064-002,929
2013-05-13,Senior Citizens Performing Physically Demanding Jobs,012-001-090-018-064,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The type of jobs suitable for workers depends on many factors, such as the worker’s skill sets, physical abilities and preferences. While we do not actively re-deploy older workers into any particular jobs or industries, we tailor the job placement assistance that we provide to meet each job seeker’s circumstances and needs. For instance, WDA’s Career Centres are sensitive to the needs and requirements of each individual, including senior citizens. Our Career Consultants adopt a case-management approach to help each client based on his individual capabilities, circumstances, physical abilities and job preferences. We also provide information to workers and job seekers to help them make more informed job choices. In addition, we help those who wish to change jobs do so, by referring them to other jobs and helping them acquire the relevant skills.",2,3,012-001-090-018-064-003,930
2013-05-13,Senior Citizens Performing Physically Demanding Jobs,012-001-090-018-064,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Given our ageing population, the proportion of older workers will increase across all industries over time. Therefore, more importantly, we need to prepare employers and workers for this demographic shift in our workforce. Employers need to redesign their jobs and work processes to better match the capabilities and needs of older workers. This will help older workers to continue to work effectively in their respective occupations. Job-redesign not only helps to make jobs less physically demanding, it can also increase productivity through process improvements.",3,4,012-001-090-018-064-004,931

2013-05-13,Home-Ownership Needs of Low-Income Elderly,012-001-090-018-075,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"  The Enhanced Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS) and the Silver Housing Bonus (SHB) were implemented on 1 February 2013. To date, we have received 265 applications for the Enhanced LBS, or an average of 88 applications per month. This is higher than an average of 18 applications per month before the enhancements. For SHB, we have received 15 applications and 170 requests for financial counselling. The numbers are lower, as SHB has just been implemented and the process of selling and buying of flats to right-size and qualify for SHB takes time. We will continue to reach out to elderly Singaporeans to raise awareness of the schemes.",1,2,012-001-090-018-075-002,983
2013-05-13,Home-Ownership Needs of Low-Income Elderly,012-001-090-018-075,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"The Enhanced LBS and SHB are part of a range of monetisation options for elderly Singaporeans who wish or need to unlock the value in their HDB flat asset to enhance retirement income. Elderly Singaporeans who have adequate finances or family support may not feel the need to take up the schemes. Nonetheless, as our population ages, we will look into more ways to help elderly who wish to monetise their flats. This topic will be discussed as part of MND’s ""Our Singapore Conversation on Housing"". We invite Singaporeans to join the discussions and suggest ways to further enhance the monetisation options.",2,3,012-001-090-018-075-003,984

2013-05-13,Exposures of Financial Institutions to Home and Real Estate Development Financing,012-001-090-018-076,Mr Gan Thiam Poh,asked the Prime Minister (a) what are the respective exposures of financial institutions (FIs) to (i) owner-occupied home financing (ii) non-owner occupied home financing and (iii) real estate development financing; (b) whether such exposures are excessive and healthy; (c) what is the impact on FIs for each percentage of increase in interest cost; and (d) what is the impact on FIs of a downward correction in property prices.,1,1,012-001-090-018-076-001,986
2013-05-13,Exposures of Financial Institutions to Home and Real Estate Development Financing,012-001-090-018-076,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"  As of March 2013, property-related exposures accounted for 28% of banks’ total outstanding non-bank loans. These exposures comprised housing loans at 17%, and loans to property developers and construction companies, at 11%. Of the housing loans granted, more than 70% were for owner-occupied residential properties.",1,2,012-001-090-018-076-002,987

The measures, including especially the more stringent caps on loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, have also provided a buffer for banks should property prices decline. The average LTV ratio for outstanding housing loans stood at a reasonable 48% as of Q1 201310.",2,3,012-001-090-018-076-003,988

An FI could be affected in two ways. First, its net interest margins may rise or fall, depending on whether interest income from its assets increases by more or less than the interest expense on its liabilities11.",3,4,012-001-090-018-076-004,989
2013-05-13,Exposures of Financial Institutions to Home and Real Estate Development Financing,012-001-090-018-076,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister),"While the impact on the FIs’ net interest income may therefore be either positive or negative, there is a second, important way in which banks may be adversely impacted. The overall loan quality of an FI could be impacted if borrowers facing higher interest costs encounter difficulty servicing their loans, or default on their loans. The default rate currently remains very low, at well below 1% for housing loans. However, a low default rate is to be expected during years when property prices are on the upswing.",4,5,012-001-090-018-076-005,990

The aim is to assess their ability to withstand adverse financial and economic shocks, including a sharp correction to property prices. We also assess the potential impact on Singapore’s financial stability.

If unchecked, this raises the risk of a sharp decline in the property market later on. While the quality of banks’ housing loan portfolios remains strong, this could potentially deteriorate. We will continue to watch the property market closely, and take steps when necessary to avoid a bubble that could hurt borrowers and destabilise our financial system.",6,7,012-001-090-018-076-007,992

2013-05-13,Measures to Improve Vigilance against Terrorism,012-001-090-018-077,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"  Singapore has not suffered a terrorist attack in recent years. But we work on the premise that terrorist groups and radical individuals have not stopped trying. A terrorist attack remains a real and present threat to Singapore. The recent Boston Marathon bombing serves as a sombre reminder that terrorists can strike anytime, anywhere and at any target. As a community and as individuals, we must never let our guard down as we seek to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our way of life.",1,2,012-001-090-018-077-002,994

These measures have been stepped up in the wake of the Boston attack. The police are working closely with organisers of sports events to implement enhanced security measures to prevent similar attacks. This includes increasing police patrols, conducting bomb sweeps and implementing checks on persons and belongings. Besides sports events, the police will also ensure that security measures have been put in place for other high profile events and sensitive locations, and that these measures are regularly reviewed and remain effective against potential threats.",2,3,012-001-090-018-077-003,995

2013-05-13,Measures to Improve Vigilance against Terrorism,012-001-090-018-077,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Aside from the measures taken by our security agencies, our safety and security also depend on the community at large playing a key role in preventing and mitigating the effects of terrorism. The Boston attack showed how the security agencies were supported by community efforts and resources. Ordinary Bostonians provided first aid to victims and cooperated with the police in identifying and tracking down the suspects. Security measures taken by business owners in the area of the bombing, such as surveillance cameras, provided the security agencies with valuable images of what actually happened during the attack. In Singapore, MHA has worked with private business and premise owners through the Safety and Security Watch Groups to enhance security and vigilance in commercial premises and during large scale events. There is no room for complacency in dealing with potential terror threats that could strike us anytime. MHA will continue to strengthen our capabilities to deal with potential threats while expanding our community partnership programmes to ensure that everyone is aware and prepared to play his or her part in keeping Singapore safe and secure.",4,5,012-001-090-018-077-005,997
2013-05-13,Tax Allowances under the Mergers and Acquisitions Scheme,012-001-090-018-078,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether the utilisation of tax allowances by 42 companies in Years of Assessment 2011 and 2012 under the Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) scheme is within the expectation of the Ministry and if there will be plans to further enhance the scheme to provide greater incentives to stimulate more M&A activities amongst small and medium enterprises to facilitate industry consolidation.,1,1,012-001-090-018-078-001,998
2013-05-13,Tax Allowances under the Mergers and Acquisitions Scheme,012-001-090-018-078,Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,"  Of the 42 companies which have benefited from the Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) scheme over the last two Years of Assessment (YAs), 31 are smaller companies with annual revenue of up to $50 million. Such companies are the main target of the scheme. Moreover, the number of companies which utilised the M&A scheme in the YA 2012 had more than doubled compared to YA 2011.

2013-05-13,Rationale for Penalties under the Statistics Act,012-001-090-018-079,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"  The Department of Statistics (DOS)’s statistical activities are governed by the Statistics Act. Surveys conducted by DOS are usually carried out on a sample of firms or households that is representative of the entire population. Obtaining accurate returns from this representative sample is critical to ensure that the statistics compiled are reliable, as they are widely used by the government, academics and the general public. Accuracy of returns includes not only ensuring that data captured on individual firms or households are correct and consistent, but also that there is no selection and response bias in terms of respondents to the survey.",1,2,012-001-090-018-079-002,1002
2013-05-13,Rationale for Penalties under the Statistics Act,012-001-090-018-079,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,The penalties provided under Section 9(1) of the Statistics Act are thus intended to deter non-response and wilful provision of false information to DOS. The Statistics Act also sets out strict requirements to protect the confidentiality of individual data collected. The penalties and safeguards in the Statistics Act are similar to statistical legislations governing national surveys in many other developed and regional countries.,2,3,012-001-090-018-079-003,1003

For example, trained survey officers who can speak the languages and dialects that the respondents are conversant in will make arrangements to visit at dates and timings convenient to the respondents. In the case of the Household Expenditure Survey, which takes place every five years and is currently being conducted, survey officers will assist households with the recording of their daily expenditure if necessary, and also accept receipts with sufficient details. DOS will only impose penalties for non-compliance as a last resort. Thus far, DOS has not had to do so for household surveys.",3,4,012-001-090-018-079-004,1004

NEA has no plans to change the current arrangement where the cleaning of hawker centres is a shared responsibility between the various stakeholders, including the Town Councils, the Hawker Associations and the cleaning companies who employ the cleaners.

About 9 in 10 employers indicated that such programmes have helped their employees to be more effective in their work, and were able to handle duties beyond the technical and professional areas. More than 9 in 10 employers also observed that their employers were more motivated to perform better in their work after completing their course of study.",3,5,012-001-090-018-098-005,1079

2013-05-13,Foreign Worker Quota for the Construction Sector,012-001-090-018-103,Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef,asked the Acting Minister for Manpower whether the foreign worker quota for the construction sector can follow that set for the year in which the project is awarded and not the year of commencement of the project.,1,1,012-001-090-018-103-001,1104
2013-05-13,Foreign Worker Quota for the Construction Sector,012-001-090-018-103,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"  As part of our national drive towards more productivity-led manpower efficient growth, the Government has progressively reduced the Man-Year Entitlement (MYE) for the Construction sector since 2010. The MYE reflects the quota of foreign workers allocated to a main contractor for a specific construction project.

2013-05-13,Foreign Worker Quota for the Construction Sector,012-001-090-018-103,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"The reason for pegging implementation to the date of MYE applications (i.e. after the commencement of the projects), rather than date of contract award, was to encourage the industry to respond more quickly to the MYE reductions. Otherwise, the push for greater productivity in construction may be delayed for a longer period. In addition, the MYE reductions were phased out over four years, to allow the industry time to adjust. We also did not reduce the overall Dependency Ratio Ceiling (DRC) for the Construction sector, taking into account the importance of ensuring the smooth completion of key infrastructural projects.",4,5,012-001-090-018-103-005,1108
2013-05-13,Foreign Worker Quota for the Construction Sector,012-001-090-018-103,Mr Tan Chuan-Jin,"Together with the many Government assistance schemes to help companies build new capabilities, adopt technology, improve business processes and upgrade their workers, these MYE reductions are important to spur the transformation of the Construction sector towards higher productivity and lower reliance on foreign manpower. The productivity level of our Construction sector is about one-fifth below that of Hong Kong and South Korea, and even further below Japan and other international leaders. We must therefore continue to strongly encourage Construction companies to reduce their overall reliance on manpower, but in a manner that does not delay critical public infrastructure projects that are already underway.",5,6,012-001-090-018-103-006,1109
