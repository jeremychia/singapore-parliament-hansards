2017-01-09,Trade Associations' Roles to Drive Industry Transformation Maps,013-001-094-030-002,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"  Madam, I thank the Member for his question and welcome our trade associations and chambers' interest to be actively involved in our industry transformation efforts.",1,2,013-001-094-030-002-002,5
2017-01-09,Trade Associations' Roles to Drive Industry Transformation Maps,013-001-094-030-002,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"Madam, the Government regards our trade associations and chambers (TACs) as important partners who are integral to our industry transformation efforts. Industry transformation is a major initiative that requires the commitment of all stakeholders to succeed. In particular, TACs, with their in-depth understanding of the needs and growth opportunities of their respective industries, can support the development of industry-specific strategies. Hence, the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) are being jointly developed and implemented with industry associations, business chambers, companies as well as unions. And I think the Member would be familiar with that effort.",2,3,013-001-094-030-002-003,6
2017-01-09,Trade Associations' Roles to Drive Industry Transformation Maps,013-001-094-030-002,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"The 23 ITM sectors, which account for about 80% of our GDP, will be launched by the end of this year. To date, we have launched six ITMs for the retail, hotel, food services, precision engineering, logistics and food manufacturing sectors. Each of these ITMs would be led by one of our economic agencies that includes the Economic Development Board, IE Singapore, SPRING Singapore and STB. The full list of the sectors and the lead agencies is available on the MTI website. The tripartite partners will be actively involved in all aspects of the ITM process, from planning to implementation.",3,4,013-001-094-030-002-004,7
2017-01-09,Trade Associations' Roles to Drive Industry Transformation Maps,013-001-094-030-002,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"The 23 sectors include industries which are covered by the National Productivity Council and the SkillsFuture Council, and also contribute significantly to the economy and employment. However, I want to emphasise this, our aim is to enhance productivity, innovation and competitiveness across all sectors. Even in sectors for which we do not yet have an ITM, TACs can play an important role in industry development by focusing on priority areas and tapping on Government schemes for assistance.",4,5,013-001-094-030-002-005,8
2017-01-09,Trade Associations' Roles to Drive Industry Transformation Maps,013-001-094-030-002,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"For example, the Singapore Food Manufacturers' Association (SFMA) has helped to develop strategies to drive innovation and exports, which are the industry's priorities. SFMA, working together with SPRING, implemented design thinking and product development workshops to help food manufacturers develop globally competitive products. SFMA also worked with IE Singapore to launch an online Singapore shop, ""Tasty Singapore"", on China's top e-commerce platforms like Alibaba's Tmall, to help local companies enter the Chinese market.",5,6,013-001-094-030-002-006,9
2017-01-09,Trade Associations' Roles to Drive Industry Transformation Maps,013-001-094-030-002,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"TACs have also helped to generate broad-based support for industry initiatives that require scale beyond the efforts of individual companies. For instance, the Container Depot Association (Singapore) (CDAS) recently launched an electronic Container Trucking System, a common IT platform, which helped shorten waiting time at the depot and reduced redundant trips for all container logistics companies.",6,7,013-001-094-030-002-007,10
2017-01-09,Trade Associations' Roles to Drive Industry Transformation Maps,013-001-094-030-002,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"SFMA and CDAS were supported in these efforts by SPRING and IE Singapore through the Local Enterprise and Association Development programme (LEAD). LEAD is an important source of support for TACs to enhance their capacity and to help their industries improve productivity, innovate, and internationalise, even if there is no ITM. For example, the Print and Media Association of Singapore, for which there is no specific ITM, is tapping on LEAD to build a training academy, develop a machine capacity sharing platform, and support knowledge sharing and R&D collaborations in the industry. Such examples demonstrate the valuable role TACs can play in industry development.",7,8,013-001-094-030-002-008,11
2017-01-09,Trade Associations' Roles to Drive Industry Transformation Maps,013-001-094-030-002,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"Mdm Speaker, to reiterate, our industry transformation programme is a major initiative that requires the commitment of all stakeholders. We are still in the early stages and much work remains to be done. Our TACs are important partners in this effort and can make valuable contributions. My message to TACs is this  if you have a proposal to address a need to enhance skills, productivity, innovation, or internationalisation in your industry, there is no need to wait for an ITM to be launched. Take it up with the Ministry or economic agency with whom you have been dealing. There are no wrong doors and our economic agencies will do their best to support your efforts with the relevant programme.",8,9,013-001-094-030-002-009,12
2017-01-09,Trade Associations' Roles to Drive Industry Transformation Maps,013-001-094-030-002,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),We look forward to working closely with our TACs in this important effort.,9,10,013-001-094-030-002-010,13

2017-01-09,Implication of Recent ASEAN-Sino Partnerships,013-001-094-030-003,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"  Madam, China's investments in Southeast Asia as part of the ""Belt and Road"" initiative help to meet the region's infrastructure needs and enhance its connectivity.",1,2,013-001-094-030-003-002,15
2017-01-09,Implication of Recent ASEAN-Sino Partnerships,013-001-094-030-003,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"As a major investor in markets such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam, and Southeast Asia accounting for close to 25% of our total trade, Singapore welcomes further economic development in our region. We actively engage our neighbours, bilaterally and through ASEAN, to broaden economic cooperation and create opportunities for our businesses. This is complemented by our efforts to promote the free flow of trade and investment through the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), our network of Free Trade Agreements and Investment Guarantee Agreements, and the in-market presence of our economic agencies. Our economic agencies also work with industry partners and trade associations to track regional developments and identify opportunities.",2,3,013-001-094-030-003-003,16
2017-01-09,Implication of Recent ASEAN-Sino Partnerships,013-001-094-030-003,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"Mdm Speaker, we must expect that competition will continue to increase as our neighbours move up the value chain. This is not something new for Singapore and we will press on with efforts to enhance productivity, innovation and competitiveness. To ensure that our industries and companies remain well-positioned for growth, the Government adopts a range of strategies across sectors. Specifically on ports, which the Member had highlighted, the Ministry of Transport will elaborate later on our efforts to keep our port competitive by investing in technology and automation to improve productivity and service levels.",3,4,013-001-094-030-003-004,17
2017-01-09,Implication of Recent ASEAN-Sino Partnerships,013-001-094-030-003,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"Members will also be aware, as I had just elaborated, that we have embarked on a $4.5 billion Industry Transformation Programme. Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) set out a growth and competitiveness plan for each sector, supported by initiatives to raise productivity, develop the right skills for the jobs in the sector now and in the future, drive innovation, and promote internationalisation, with Government playing its role in supporting as an enabler. In doing so, these ITMs take stock of the external trends and domestic concerns affecting each industry, some of which the Member has referred to in his question, in order to provide industry-focused support to companies.",4,5,013-001-094-030-003-005,18
2017-01-09,Implication of Recent ASEAN-Sino Partnerships,013-001-094-030-003,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran),"Transforming individual sectors is part of our broader effort to build and sustain a vibrant and resilient economy in the long term. This is also the focus of the Committee on the Future Economy (CFE), to ensure our economy remains competitive and well-positioned for future opportunities. The Committee's report will be issued soon.",5,6,013-001-094-030-003-006,19

2017-01-09,Implication of Recent ASEAN-Sino Partnerships,013-001-094-030-003,Mr S Iswaran,"  Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for his supplementary question. I do not propose to go into the CFE's recommendations. Those will come out in due course. I will make this point  in terms of investments and economic development in the region, in an era of globalisation and increasing connectivity, when we are seeing more Chinese companies go abroad, and they are not just from China but they are from other parts of the world as well. We are no stranger to investments from the US and Europe. We must continue to expect that there will be development taking place, sometimes in sectors that we deem to be complementary; other times, maybe where we are in direct competition.",1,9,013-001-094-030-003-009,22
2017-01-09,Implication of Recent ASEAN-Sino Partnerships,013-001-094-030-003,Mr S Iswaran,"But as I said earlier in my reply, the key point is this  overall, such investments enhance the opportunities set, whether it is to participate in these projects as partners or in terms of overall economic development. Importantly, we must continue our effort in maintaining our emphasis on competitiveness and ensuring that our industries remain viable in the face of different types of competition that will arise; today, it is this form that the Member has highlighted, but there were others in the past and there will certainly be different forms in the future.",2,10,013-001-094-030-003-010,23

In addition, our position as a regional bunkering and oil storage hub is anchored by a strong ecosystem of oil refineries and oil traders, and by the high volume of ships calling at Singapore for various services.",2,3,013-001-094-030-004-003,26

For example, the new berths at Pasir Panjang Terminal Phases 3 and 4 feature a fully-automated yard crane system, which raises port productivity. In time, PSA will integrate this with an automated guided vehicle system, which is currently under trial, to move the containers around the port. Singapore is also the first port in the world to require bunker to be delivered via a mass flow metering system. This not only enhances operational efficiency, but also strengthens the integrity of our bunkering services.",6,7,013-001-094-030-004-007,30

MPA regularly surveys shipping companies on how they view supporting port services in Singapore, such as towage and pilotage services, compared to those at other ports. This enables MPA to systematically identify and address any shortcomings, and keep standards high.",7,8,013-001-094-030-004-008,31

With an annual capacity of up to 65 million TEUs, the Tuas terminal is expected to be the largest container terminal in the world, allowing us to achieve greater economies of scale and to more efficiently handle the mega ships of the future.

2017-01-09,Impact on Singapore of Construction of Kuala Linggi International Port in Malacca,013-001-094-030-004,Mrs Josephine Teo,"  Thank you, Mdm Speaker. In response to Mr Saktiandi's question, I think our working assumption is that the shipping companies are always driven, firstly, by commercial considerations. They are not going to call at our port because of altruism or because they like us. So, the first thing we must do is to ensure that the product that we offer to them, the services that we offer to them, meet their requirements, and in fact, allow them to make a better go of their commercial considerations than if they were to call at other ports. That is the primary consideration.",1,16,013-001-094-030-004-016,39
2017-01-09,Impact on Singapore of Construction of Kuala Linggi International Port in Malacca,013-001-094-030-004,Mrs Josephine Teo,"So, all of the activities and the significant investments that we are making are geared towards ensuring that commercially, the considerations will tilt the calculations of the shipping companies in favour of Singapore. Therefore, efficiency is of very high priority, and I think also, the ability to deliver high quality service in a very consistent and reliable manner. That is also what counts.",2,17,013-001-094-030-004-017,40
2017-01-09,Impact on Singapore of Construction of Kuala Linggi International Port in Malacca,013-001-094-030-004,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Furthermore, I think the shipping companies will also consider if, for example, there are instances where the services have to be curtailed or if they are not up to expectations, what is the recovery plan that the port operator is able to offer? I think those are the primary considerations and it is in these areas that we must continue to put our emphasis on, in order to secure our position as a competitive hub port.",3,18,013-001-094-030-004-018,41

2017-01-09,Update on Seizure of Singapore's Terrex Infantry Carrier Vehicles in Hong Kong,013-001-094-030-006,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"  Thank you very much. Mdm Speaker, MINDEF and the Chief of Army have already disclosed the procedures used by the SAF for shipping military platforms for overseas training. Let me summarise. Singapore has limited training areas. Each year, the SAF moves over 700 military platforms using commercial carriers to all parts of the world in Asia, Australia, Europe and the United States. The SAF's contracts with these shipping companies and agents require them to comply with established protocols and all relevant international and local port rules. But the contracts leave it to the shipping companies to designate routes and ports, because this is their core business. Neither the SAF, Singapore, nor indeed most other countries, operate on the assumption that our cargo will be arbitrarily seized when transiting reputable foreign ports. The SAF has followed these procedures for shipping military equipment for over 30 years without any significant incidents.",1,8,013-001-094-030-006-008,54
2017-01-09,Update on Seizure of Singapore's Terrex Infantry Carrier Vehicles in Hong Kong,013-001-094-030-006,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"These commercial arrangements have enabled the SAF to ship military equipment safely and economically. It would cost three to four times more, and add several hundred million dollars to MINDEF's annual budget, to ship all military equipment directly from point-to-point. Neither does the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) have transport ships with that scale and capability to ship all this equipment. However, our Landing Ships Tanks (LST), currently our largest multi-purpose and transport ships, are due for replacement.

Where we think the risk of detention of SAF assets has gone up, whether in Asia or any other part of the world, we will impose extra precautions even if this means incurring higher freight charges.

They were in transit on board the ship when they were ordered to be off-loaded by the Hong Kong authorities and detained. The legal position is that the SAF Terrexes and other equipment detained in Hong Kong are the property of the Singapore Government. They are protected by sovereign immunity, even though they were being shipped by commercial carriers. This means that they are immune from any measures of constraint abroad. They cannot legally be detained or confiscated by other countries. This principle is well-established under international law, and we are advised by lawyers that it is also the law in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).",6,13,013-001-094-030-006-013,59

This is an enormous achievement of China in the last 70 years.",3,25,013-001-094-030-007-025,110

If we look at the way Southeast Asia and even Singapore have progressed over the last 70 years since the end of the Second World War, there were several critical ingredients to this. One is that we had peace and stability. Two, we had international law. Three, we have had reasonably free trade. These have been ingredients for us all to achieve progress and prosperity without war and conflict. So, looked against this light, we must welcome a rising China, a stronger China, an economically more integrated China. And we have to focus on the opportunities whilst at the same time recognising that there will be issues to resolve from time to time.",4,26,013-001-094-030-007-026,111

We are a tiny city-state. We are a multi-racial society and we are located in the centre of Southeast Asia. These circumstances are permanent. What this means ‒ and I said it earlier ‒ is that, from time to time, other countries, big countries, will place expectations, quite frankly, sometimes, they will put pressure on us because they want us to completely align ourselves with their interests. This is where we, sometimes, from time to time, have to courteously, respectfully, differ and remind everyone, big or small, that please let Singapore be Singapore. We may be small but we are an independent, sovereign nation. We have our own permanent interests. We want to maintain our independence and to have as many friends as possible. We cannot be at the beck and call, or act at the behest of any single super power. Let us be ourselves. And if that means, from time to time, I have to have a difference with you, so be it.

Whether it is TPP, RCEP or any other free trade agreement, the point is this  trade represents three times our GDP. This is a ratio which I think no other country has. And because of that, for us, trade is not a negotiating point; it is not debating point. Trade is our lifeblood. So, when we go round the world saying, ""Look, we want to lower the barriers for trade because we believe this is a formula that has generated enormous opportunities and wealth for so many of us"", that does not mean that free trade is an unalloyed good. You have to be aware that for each nation that engages in this negotiation, you also have to ensure that you protect the vulnerable groups in our society.

I do understand the Minister's point. But in the light of the comments made by China after the reports of the seizure and particularly comments that we should respect the One China policy and that they have communicated with us and that they have also requested that we abide by Hong Kong's laws, what are the grounds that the Ministry has to assume that China has not influenced Hong Kong's decision to detain the vehicles or in the decision-making process?

Hong Kong has told us they are conducting investigations. They told us that they will handle this in accordance with their laws. Both the Minister for Defence and I stand before you, and I am sure the message will be conveyed to them that we welcome this position, that Hong Kong will handle this according to its laws. I should add that China also has publicly stated that this will be handled according to Hong Kong SAR's laws.

Again, because this is so important, I hope Members will bear with me if I repeat word-for-word what I said earlier. Our relations with China and our interactions with Hong Kong and Taiwan are based strictly on our One China policy. We have consistently abided by this policy and the understandings reached when we established diplomatic relations with China in 1990. This is a longstanding position.

Unfortunately, SingNet's DHCP server encountered problems assigning IP addresses to its broadband customers' modems. As a result, these customers could not obtain or renew their IP addresses in order to connect to the Internet.

At the end of the day, it is something in which we are mindful where we need everyone within the value chain − the businesses and even consumers like ourselves − to put in place some cyber hygiene practices at home and in our workplaces. We will work closely with the industry and industry associations to ensure that all our businesses understand what needs to be done. We will work with the major operators who provide the service to the small companies so that they understand what needs to be done. So, it is an on-going effort.

We have to continue to monitor the situation. I agree with him that the most important thing is how we can resolve the disruption as quickly as possible. We have impressed upon the telcos and the ISPs that this is something that we want them to put in place quickly and ahead of time.

However, the unemployment rate for local residents aged 50 and above has also increased from 2.1% in September 2014 to 2.3% in September 2016, in other words, an increase of 0.2% over a period of two years. There was also a corresponding rise in the long-term unemployment rate by 0.2% from 0.8% to 1% over the same two-year period from September 2014 to September 2016.

On the ground, many of us have seen more residents coming forward to the Meet-the-People Sessions (MPS) seeking help, especially for those who are above 40 years old. If they lose their jobs, it is very hard for them to find a job. Even if they find a job, usually the pay is very much lower than what they had previously. So, there is also this issue about underemployment. Sometimes, after a while, they have no choice but to take up any employment that they can find. I mean they are not choosy but, on the other hand, if do have a family to feed. Our hearts are with them and we want to know how we can help them further.",1,7,013-001-094-030-010-007,170

Not all jobseekers need our help. For example, last year, we conducted more than 90 job fairs for the employers to offer their job openings to job seekers.

2017-01-09,Number of Workers who Secure Jobs at Government-supported Job Fairs,013-001-094-030-011,Mr Lim Swee Say,"Secondly, in terms of job fairs, let me put it this way. Jobseekers coming to us to look for jobs, we will help them in various ways. First, one to one. For every jobseeker, we look at his or her skills profile, career interest, and we look for a suitable job for him. So, a one-to-one matching. In some cases, it is a group to group. For example, a company has a retrenchment exercise, 20 workers were retrenched. For the group of 20 workers, we look for a group of employers. We will bring the employers to the company to do a group-to-group matching, and try to help the 20 workers to find 20 jobs. In other cases, we go for the ""many to many"" approach. Job fairs is an example where we organise a job fair − typically about 400 jobs per job fair − and the number of jobseekers attending can run into hundreds and thousands. We do not keep track of them.",2,10,013-001-094-030-011-010,188
2017-01-09,Number of Workers who Secure Jobs at Government-supported Job Fairs,013-001-094-030-011,Mr Lim Swee Say,"The reason why we do not keep track of them is because the job fair serves various purposes. In some cases, jobseekers are not looking to work but we want to encourage them. For example, in a community, we want to encourage more of our older residents to take on employment. So, we would bring employers with jobs in the community to the Community Centre to draw them out. As a result, we have residents with no intention to work, but having attended our job fair, they said, ""Oh, I did not know that nearby there are such job openings."" So, this is the first objective. The second objective is that we have jobseekers who are not active jobseekers or what we call the passive jobseekers. They have jobs today, they are not in a hurry to get a job. But they would like to know what is available. For example, when we organise a job fair with the hotel industry, many workers from other sectors come to attend and understand better where is the hotel sector heading for so that in case one day, they need to move on to this sector. Of course, lastly, those who are looking for jobs.",3,11,013-001-094-030-011-011,189

The first phase of reforms undertaken in 2012 requires contract details of OTC derivatives transactions, such as the size, mark-to-market value and maturity, to be reported to licensed trade repositories. This enables MAS to monitor any potential financial stability risks. Later this year, MAS will finalise and implement regulations for the central clearing of widely traded OTC derivatives contracts.

In fact, if I may suggest, that the MAS should perhaps not allow the primary residence of the investor to be used to contribute to the net personal assets to meet the S$2 million threshold.

In the case of joint accounts, when one party is a non-accredited investor, he or she can opt out of protection measures available to retail investors. While it may be common in the wealth management industry where only one joint account holder is an accredited investor, for example, a millionaire father with a joint banking account with his son who is still in university and we cannot over regulate to not permit non-accredited investors from being joint account holders. It may be prudent to add a requirement that mandates banks to primarily deal with the party who is the Accredited Investor, if the investment products sold are not permitted to be sold to retail investors.",21,78,013-001-094-030-016-078,279

My concern is that some bankers may not be properly incentivised to accurately determine a customer's net assets, for example, a careless banker may ""overestimate"" a potential client's net assets so as to ""upgrade"" him to an accredited investor. Lessons from the recent 1MDB money laundering scandal should be a stark reminder that self-regulation by banks may not be completely effective in some areas.

Individuals whose wealth is concentrated in their primary residence and have little liquid assets otherwise, will no longer qualify as AIs. The aim of this change seems to be to ensure that AIs have at least S$1 million in liquid assets, that is, financial assets net of the property they reside in, which is reasonable intent, and one that I agree with.",17,100,013-001-094-030-016-100,301
2017-01-09,Securities and Futures (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-030-016,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"I would like to ask a few questions about how these definitions will be operationalised so as to best realise this intent. Firstly, does the S$1 million financial asset threshold include the value of insurance policies? If so, how is this value calculated? By virtue of total premiums paid, maturity value of the policy or some other criteria?",18,101,013-001-094-030-016-101,302
2017-01-09,Securities and Futures (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-030-016,Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member),"Secondly, should mark-to-market prices be used to determine the value of the property as well as the value of the more liquid assets? At the moment, some banks depend on investors' self-declaration in form filling. Will Financial Service Institutions or FSIs be required to ascertain mark-to-market prices for the properties and financial assets that the investors declare? If so, this may saddle FSIs with higher compliance costs, costs which may get passed on to their customers to some extent. But in any case, it would be important and useful for the position to be clarified so that FSIs are held to the same standard and are consistent in their practices.",19,102,013-001-094-030-016-102,303

For example, the bonds of companies undergoing some debt restructuring exercise or companies that are undergoing liquidation. Are illiquid bonds included in the definition of financial assets or should we differentiate between illiquid and liquid bonds to be considered within the S$1 million financial asset threshold?",20,103,013-001-094-030-016-103,304

2017-01-09,Securities and Futures (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-030-016,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"Firstly, the amendment to the Securities and Futures Bill safeguards the investors' interests. Recently, I read a newspaper article in Lianhe Wanbao, and the headline is, ""Sleepless Nights for elderly couple who lose $30,000"". An elderly retired couple attended an investment talk and forked out $10,000 to buy bonds. The other party promised they would get back their principal plus 10% interest within a year. However, when the bond matured, they did not get their principal back. This elderly couple has been suffering from insomnia because they would also lose their further investment of $20,000 in bonds which is about to mature.",3,107,013-001-094-030-016-107,308

There are so many types of financial products in the market now and many seniors hope to retire comfortably using these avenues of wealth management, but not all investors are savvy enough or equipped with the necessary knowledge to evaluate the risks the merits of a financial product. The sales executives tend to be glib and persuasive; those with no investment experience can be easily misled.",4,108,013-001-094-030-016-108,309
2017-01-09,Securities and Futures (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-030-016,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"Based on the current legislation, investors' risk category is defined according to their financial assets, including the value of their properties. For instance, some investors may have financial assets of two million, but this is mainly in property, with very little in cash. Once the investment fails, practically everything is wiped out, bringing their quality of life under jeopardy. Amending the Bill would define more clearly the conditions of retail investors and institutional investors; only part of the property value can be included as part of their personal assets. This would bring up the threshold for the retail investors and safeguard their interests.",5,109,013-001-094-030-016-109,310
2017-01-09,Securities and Futures (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-030-016,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"The second reason is that the amendment of the Bill would widen the scope of governance, and ensure that transactions are properly regulated. In recent years, some ""non-conventional investment products"" have become increasingly popular, like precious metals, red wine, land banking, and et cetera. Prior to the amendment, with the exception of collective investments, these non-conventional investment products do not come under the purview of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). In order to avoid coming under MAS regulation, some market players have become very creative and restructured their products. Once the amendments are enacted, all investment products would come under the purview of MAS. This is a very good move.",6,110,013-001-094-030-016-110,311
2017-01-09,Securities and Futures (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-030-016,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"However, besides these two points, I still have some reservations. Overly strict controls may make the financial markets stagnate. A prosperous and a lively market has to have some element of risk. How could the Government achieve a balance between the two? For example, SMEs always encounter problems of financing. There is a new financing method called the crowdfunding, which could provide capital for SMEs and start-up companies.",7,111,013-001-094-030-016-111,312

After amending the Securities and Futures Act, this could hamper such new funding channels. Hence, I hope that when the Government decides to stipulate related legislations in the future, it could strike a balance between maintaining an active market and strengthening governance. An over-regulated system could produce the ""hairy-crab effect"" of constraining the markets.

To many, the pervasive misconduct amongst traders felt like ""daylight robbery"", and served to further corrode what little remained of public trust in banks and those who run them. Their manipulation of the LIBOR rate impacted the man-in-the-street as well as corporations around the world, because it affected what was paid for loans and earned for savings.

The financial industry is both complex and competitive. This creates some undesirable outcomes. For example, lending cost is advertised differently for different products. It is calculated differently for  (i) housing loans compared to car loans, (ii) car loans compared to credit card loans; and (iii) credit card loans compared to hire-purchase financing. Processing fees and penalty costs for these different products vary considerably too. Because of all these, consumers have difficulty understanding the true cost of their spending decision. For decisions like buying a house or a vehicle, a miscalculation could be a big financial impact.",8,147,013-001-094-030-016-147,348

Perhaps, MAS can study international best practices, including from the US' ""Truth in Lending"" Act. This Act requires the lenders to provide important pieces of information, such as the annual percentage rate (APR), the term of the loan, and the total cost of the borrowers. Can MAS share what it considers as the best formula to calculate interest rates, be it APR, EIR or nominal rates, and lending cost, which also includes fees and penalties, to our consumers? Would MAS also consider gradually aligning our companies towards communicating interest rates and lending cost, in a simple and unified way?",9,148,013-001-094-030-016-148,349

Two, brains − a team of highly qualified experts who can quickly assess the risk profile and complexity of any new products, and flag potential risks.

Financial products can now be distributed through multiple channels, not all of them visible to the authorities. To counter this, we should enlist the help of the public to flag any suspicious offerings. The goal is to make this as simple and as painless as possible, to encourage people to highlight any products where malfeasance may be suspected. While this may create false positives, it is more important here to avoid the converse problem of false negatives resulting in significant losses for investors.",9,170,013-001-094-030-016-170,371
2017-01-09,Securities and Futures (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-030-016,Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"Brains. Regulating new financial products is a challenging task. On one side, you have some of the smartest people in the world, who are so incentivised to create new products and very complicated products to make as much money as possible for themselves. And on the other hand, you have overburdened regulators trying to stay on top of new innovations over a multiple asset classes. One solution could be to create a committee that convenes to assess the complaints and determine if new structures and products are fraudulent. This should be staffed by industry experts drawn from leading financial institutions, who would be called upon on a regular basis.",10,171,013-001-094-030-016-171,372

This means empowering them to make immediate and decisive action, including blacklisting or even shutting down entire asset classes. It could also define which investor types are allowed to invest in a particular asset class. Again, there might be ""false positives"" where the asset class ultimately proves to be legitimate, but the focus should be on protecting retail investors.",11,172,013-001-094-030-016-172,373

And if the expert panel judges that there is reason to believe that it is fraudulent, that it does not pass muster, then the committee puts it on a blacklist. The burden then falls on the issuer to prove that it is innocent by undergoing the full suite of regulatory due diligence. All further activities in this issue must cease and all monies collected since must be held in escrow until regulators are satisfied. The committee acts as a ""rapid response force"" to flag suspicious activities, giving the regulators more time to respond to it fully. Speed is of the essence here as we must stop fraudulent offerings before too many people get affected.",12,173,013-001-094-030-016-173,374

Ultimately, individual investors need to take responsibility for their own actions. But given the asymmetry of information, they need help to decide. A classification scheme that indicates the likelihood of capital loss and the size of losses, as well as the technical complexity of the product, would help retail investors avoid unsuitable products. In one of the consultation papers, there was mention of this complexity versus risk framework which personally I thought was a good idea. The only challenge was that it required a high degree of technical expertise to execute well. This would require additional regulatory resources, which I would like to encourage and support.",13,174,013-001-094-030-016-174,375

As he pointed out, investors who have more wealth may not necessarily be better informed or require less regulatory protection than retail investors. Likewise someone who has certain knowledge, such as having made certain investment transactions or worked in the financial industry for some time also may not necessarily be sophisticated investors when it comes to their own money. The truth is all criteria are never perfect − we are all finding proxies and the best possible proxies. But the use of wealth or income thresholds, while not perfect, is a fairly objective proxy for financial sophistication and is also widely used by other regulators around the world.",10,185,013-001-094-030-016-185,386

With that, the specific AI-eligibility thresholds become much less critical. In a similar vein, Mr Leon Perera asked several questions on what are the detailed calculations of the threshold. To answer his question, it does include insurance and life policies; it does include all bonds, liquid or not.

MAS has considered this carefully but we decided against it. The flexibility which will be given to joint accounts where at least one account holder is an AI is on the condition that every account holder opts-in to be an AI, and only in respect of investment transactions made out of that joint account. However, unlike joint accounts, corporates and trusts are distinct legal persons, and shareholders and beneficiaries behind them do not enjoy that right to opt-in. Hence, corporates and trusts should only be treated as AIs if they are AI-eligible in their own right, or all shareholders or beneficiaries are AIs.",13,188,013-001-094-030-016-188,389

In response to industry's concerns − and this came about because of our consultation effort − the industry raised on concerns on the potential impact to their business. MAS will apply an opt-out approach for existing AI clients. So, the default for existing AI clients is to remain as AIs if they continue to meet the AI-eligibility criteria. FIs would only need to notify them of their right to opt-out of the AI status, and the implications of their choices.",14,189,013-001-094-030-016-189,390

However, this need not be at odds with the enhancements to the AI regime. The new definition of AI is a sharper one and will accord protection to investors who need them the most. The opt-in mechanism raise awareness of their own investment needs, and better understanding of the nature of their relationship with their financial service provider. These are really the key reasons behind the changes to the AI scheme, a sharper protection, and is important for the long-term competitiveness of the industry and sophistication of the market.",15,190,013-001-094-030-016-190,391

These come from a wide range of sources, including members of the public, financial industry and other regulatory and enforcement agencies, local as well as overseas. Where information received suggests a breach of laws, the relevant experts within the authorities will investigate and take appropriate action. It actually operates in similar ways as the committee suggested by Mr Ong Teng Koon. But the function is operationally sited, as opposed to becoming a staffed committee. This, we think, can ensure greater responsiveness.",18,193,013-001-094-030-016-193,394

To warn consumers early that they are dealing with entities that are not licensed by MAS, MAS publishes an Investors Alert List (IAL). The IAL contains a list of entities that may have been wrongly perceived by the public to be licensed by MAS. Consumers are encouraged to exercise caution when dealing with such entities as they will not be able to rely on regulatory safeguards under the SFA. The list is not exhaustive, and is updated based, in part, on public feedback and complaints received by MAS.",19,194,013-001-094-030-016-194,395

However, as highlighted by several Members of this House, this can be seen as draconian, and we must be mindful that an overly-regulated environment could stifle legitimate business and innovation. We should avoid inadvertently subjecting all forms of economic activities, involving consumers handing over monies to a third party in anticipation of a return, to financial regulation.

We deliberately took a calibrated approach, in two phases, and for the first phase, focused on trade reporting and central clearing obligations because these have the biggest systemic implications. Even for trade reporting, we did not take a ""Big Bang"" approach, but start with larger financial institutions, such as banks, and for larger asset classes, such as interest rate derivatives first. For clearing, it is a similar progressive implementation approach. Later this year, MAS will require large players, that is, banks with above $20 billion notional value of OTC derivatives, to have their widely-traded US-dollar and Singapore-dollar interest rate derivatives to be centrally cleared.",31,206,013-001-094-030-016-206,407

It ranges from three months to 12 months, depending on the seniority as well as the functional role of the officer. But conflict of interests do exist and we all know that. Ultimately, it is also an issue of integrity. Given the reputation of MAS, the conduct of our officers and our track record, I do not think there is any suggestion that our system is currently inadequate. So, we will continue to do these ‒ impose a garden leave but allow a movement of talent from industry to Government, to any other sectors. In that way, when we have regulation and policy reviews, there is greater understanding all round.

There are two scenarios I would like to highlight here. The first is that of an employer who does not wish to offer re-employment on grounds of performance which is allowed under the Act and the second is that of an employer who terminates an employee with notice on ageist grounds because they have become too old but does not state this reason or leave any evidence of this being the reason.",4,36,013-001-094-030-017-036,474

A good starting point would be to get good data from a comprehensive survey of employees, not only of employers, and this is a subject we have discussed in this House last year. We could then look at better carrots or employers can demonstrate robust and auditable hiring and firing practices that give no quota to prejudice of any kind.

2017-01-09,Retirement and Re-employment (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-030-017,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"There are many reasons why it is important to expand the opportunities for older persons to work, if they wish to. Foremost among these of course is the ageing population as the Minister has already mentioned. In addition, the Ministry of Manpower's statistics report that the older residents aged 60 and over accounted for the largest share among age groups with residents outside the labour force. In 2006, 35% of residents outside the labour force were 60 or older; over the decade, this proportion has grown steadily, with the latest reported figure for 2016 showing 44% of residents outside the labour force belonging to this age group. With figures of this magnitude, expanding opportunities for re-employment beyond the current threshold of 65 years is clearly welcomed and necessary.",10,60,013-001-094-030-017-060,498

Another important factor is the duration of the employment contracts that employees are on. In June 2007, 25% of resident employees aged 60 and over were on term contracts. Almost a decade later, in June 2015, we still have 21% of resident employees aged 60 and above on term contracts. So, despite the improvement over the intervening period of time, the age-connected pattern in term contracts has remained basically unchanged. Hence, just as in June 2007, the proportion of employees on term contracts was more than twice that of all other age groups for those above 24 years of age. In addition, the proportion of resident employees on term contracts was lowest for those aged 30 to 39, and then increased with the group age thereafter for all the other groups.",11,61,013-001-094-030-017-061,499

For example, the employer can arbitrarily choose not to offer re-employment to the employee if the employee is assessed by his employer to have unsatisfactory work performance or medically unfit to continue working. The law should make provisions to allow for a worker to have independent assessment on medical fitness. This can be achieved by appointing a review panel of independent doctors, to challenge the assessment of the company's doctor when the worker is certified unfit to work.

In 1993, the average life expectancy of Singaporeans was around 77 years. Today's average life expectancy is around 83 years and still rising. What was the model that was used to calculate the optimal retirement age that led to 67 as the target retirement age in 1993? Is the same model in use today?

It has been stuck since 1999. Twenty years is a good time to reconsider whether we should raise the retirement age to 65 for future cohorts and existing cohorts if they so desire. This will encourage employers to think longer term when it comes to staff recruitment and, especially, training and retention.

If so, why not entrench 65 as the retirement age then? The employers are ready. They do not even cut salaries by 10% at age 60 anymore, which is why the Bill is repealing that part of the law.

Is there any reason not to stipulate the contract length to be at least two years, unless the senior chooses otherwise to have one-year contracts? Two years seems more reasonable and balanced.

Previously, workers were required to engrave intricate details like 2D dot-matrix or QR prints on very small data plates. Thanks to job redesign, workers can now make use of a laser marking machine and the relevant software to perform the engraving. This is especially helpful for the mature workers as it augments their physical abilities and enables them to continue doing this high precision job. This also helps them gain new skills and new process capabilities. The reduction in printing errors saved time and money, thus raising productivity for the company. This example showcases the viability of job redesign and I urge the Ministry to encourage and support more companies to embark on such projects.

If one were to flip the coin to the other side, one would come to realise that fundamentally older workers provide stability to the organisation. For example, should the network fail or if there is tech downtime, they do not panic for they have alternative ways to get things done even though they are not tech savvy unlike our younger generation that often become paralysed when there is tech downtime. We should recognise and acknowledge the fact that our baby boomers and Generation X are willing to learn new technology to be tech savvy.

A technician denied of re-employment after he turned 65 since the employer's legal obligation is until employee is aged 65, sought employment in many industries including security industry which was a 12-hour shift work. He wants to be gainfully employed so as to keep himself active while earning to support his spouse who is a housewife as his two children are residing overseas. The word is to keep himself active, that is occupied and to have some money in his pocket for daily expenses. ""Is it too much to ask for?"" he asked. He personally shared that there is prejudice against older workers which is a challenge to prove as it is rather subtle. I shared with him that TAFEP has been doing extensive work to promote fair and progressive work practices and to highlight cases of such nature to TAFEP should he feels strongly that there is discrimination. He shared that he does not want trouble.

This will also assist the SMEs who usually do not have the luxury of more resources and ability to dedicate their staff for external training. For workers in this situation, they will be further disadvantaged from not having a chance to learn broadly.

I have been waiting for many years to take over the position of my boss. My boss is going to retire very soon, because he is reaching 62 soon.

Employers did not want to move, young workers did not want us to move, and unions were pressured by senior employees not to give in to demands for wage cuts. So, we were stuck.

The core difference between retirement and re-employment age is that when you raise the retirement age, the expectation is for same job, same pay.

The re-employment age in Japan today is still at 65. We learnt from them five years ago and adopted the re-employment age of 65. Come July, our re-employment age will be 67, but in Japan, it is still 65. Our re-employment age at 67, compared to many other countries, is already among the higher ones.

Looking at the employment rate for those aged 70 to 74, Singapore is 24%. Is that low? Is that high? Again, we compare it to all these other countries. One country that is much higher than Singapore is Korea, which has 32.3%. I must really visit Korea soon to see how and what we can learn from them. Japan is again higher than us, 25%.

Up until 2012, the link between retirement age and the CPF PEA, is direct and identical. It is a point-to-point linkage. So, when the retirement age was 60, PEA was 60. When the retirement age went up to 62, PEA was 62. But in 2012, something happened. The two are still related, but they are no longer identical. They are still related because both are related to the expected life span but yet at the same time, I think from 2012, you would notice that even though we raised the re-employment age to 65, the CPF PEA in fact, went up much slower to 63 in 2012 and 64 in 2015, and 65 only in 2018.",21,100,013-001-094-030-019-100,764

It used to be point-to-point, but now, it is a range. The CPF payout start range is now 64 to 70, and the re-employment age will be 67 by July, within that age band.

Contractual benefits have never been part of the Employment Act. In other words, even the Retirement and Re-employment Act cannot protect your contractual benefits. Contractual benefits are bounded through contracts. It applies to all workers, young and old. Whether you are 40 years old or you are re-employed and aged 62, all your employment contract terms depend on what is contained in there; it is a subject of direct negotiation between the employee and employer, or between the union and the management.

So, if the employer is indeed being unreasonable in terms of the terms and conditions, and after mediation, we could not succeed in a resolution, and the case goes to the ECT, the ECT will make reference to this set of tripartite guidelines and rule whether the terms and conditions offered upon re-employment are reasonable.

2017-01-09,Retirement and Re-employment (Amendment) Bill ,013-001-094-030-019,Mr Leon Perera,"  I thank the Minister for his answers. Just a few brief clarification questions. First, with regard to the possibility of discriminatory employment practices, the Minister cited an example of ageism, everything going bad in the last three years and how the employee in that case can go to MOM. My question  is what will MOM do at that point. I suppose MOM will look at the case and see if it contravenes the Retirement and Re-employment Act. Would MOM also look at that company in a more systematic way? The reason I mention this is because of the ""double weak companies"". For those who discriminate against Singaporeans, there is a so-called framework where you look for other evidence or a pattern of discrimination, who are the people they have hired over time and so on. Does the MOM do that now in cases of ageist discrimination and other kinds of discrimination, or will it consider doing so in the future if it does not do so now?",1,132,013-001-094-030-019-132,796

I am wondering why do the tripartite partners feel that raising the retirement age or eliminating the retirement age, reduces the Labour Force Participation. I am wondering is there really a causation or could it just be a correlation. There could be other reasons countries like the UK and the US may have lower post-65 labour Force Participation; they could have more generous defined benefits and pension schemes, for example. It may not be just the raising of retirement age that is the thing that lowered the Labour Force Participation.",2,133,013-001-094-030-019-133,797

The senior management has been ageing. When we introduced re-employment up to age 65, the employees and the union asked the management how this would affect the renewal of the senior management in the company. The Chairman and CEO, in consultation with the top management of the company, about 20 to 25 of them, they came to a collective decision. They decided that in this company, all senior management of certain positions, on a voluntary basis, will exclude themselves from re-employment. They are very determined and said that leadership renewal for their company is critical to their sustained success.

The results, so far, I would say, seem to be more positive because the employment rates in Japan and Singapore are relatively higher compared to other countries. But the Member is right that this cannot be the only reason. It could be many other reasons and that is why in Singapore, we make sure that all the conditions are right, are conducive to be supportive of re-employment. It is not easy.

An example would be if an officer or instructor fails to comply with Training Safety Regulations (TSR) or any training safety protocols recommended in any SAF lesson plans or, manuals.

2017-01-09,Measures to Reduce Food Waste,013-001-094-030-021,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what plans are in place to reduce the amount of food waste generated in light of 785.5 million kilogrammes of food waste being generated in 2015; (b) what are the top contributing factors of food wastage; and (c) what are the targeted approaches to be undertaken by the Ministry to tackle each contributing factor effectively.,1,1,013-001-094-030-021-001,871
2017-01-09,Measures to Reduce Food Waste,013-001-094-030-021,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"  Food waste is a concern to my Ministry. When we throw away food, we waste the resources used in its production and expand manpower and resources for waste collection and cleaning. Food waste, when not properly managed, causes odour and pest issues. It also contaminates recyclable materials when they are mixed. Besides the environmental impact, wasting food is a waste of money.",1,2,013-001-094-030-021-002,872
2017-01-09,Measures to Reduce Food Waste,013-001-094-030-021,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"The amount of food waste in Singapore has increased by about 50 per cent over the past ten years. Households generate around half of the food waste, with the other half generated by sources such as food manufacturers, hotels, shopping malls and hawker centres. We can expect the amount of food waste to rise further as population size, incomes and economic activities increase.",2,3,013-001-094-030-021-003,873
2017-01-09,Measures to Reduce Food Waste,013-001-094-030-021,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"Unfortunately, there is no easy solution to this problem. My Ministry believes that a multi-pronged approach should be adopted to combat food waste. This starts with avoiding, where possible, excess food production. Where this is not possible, we encourage the re-distribution of excess food. Lastly, we encourage food waste to be segregated for recycling and treatment. Food waste segregation is an important step that reduces the likelihood of recyclable contamination and enhances the effectiveness of our recycling efforts.",3,4,013-001-094-030-021-004,874
2017-01-09,Measures to Reduce Food Waste,013-001-094-030-021,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"My Ministry works closely with other Government agencies and private sector partners to combat food waste in the non-household sector. In October 2016, the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) launched a food waste minimisation guidebook for food retail establishments, with the aim of sharing good practices, such as smart planning and inventory management, to avoid food waste and save costs. To promote food redistribution, guidelines on the proper handling and re-distribution of unsold and excess food have also been incorporated. People sector organisations, such as Food Bank Singapore and Food from the Heart, also play an important role to re-distribute food to those in need.",4,5,013-001-094-030-021-005,875

Food waste is treated on site at the hawker centres at Block 628 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4 and Tiong Bahru. We have taken this one step further at Our Tampines Hub, where up to 1.4 tonnes of food waste generated from the hawker centre and food and beverage (F&B) outlets can be recycled each day into non-potable water and fertilizer. The NEA has also supported the installation of on-site food waste treatment systems at 19 premises under its 3R Fund, including Resorts World Sentosa, Mandarin Orchard and Amara Hotel.",5,6,013-001-094-030-021-006,876

The NEA launched a public education campaign in 2015 to increase awareness of the food waste situation and promote ways to reduce food wastage. These include tips on planning food purchases, food storage and food preparation habits to help consumers minimise food wastage while saving money. The NEA also partnered the North East Community Development Council (CDC) to launch the 'I Love My Food @ North East' initiative in November last year.

For example, households in Taipei segregate their food waste from other household waste before disposal. Some states in Australia have turned to technological solutions instead, such as in-sink grinders for food waste. We will monitor these best practices overseas, and hope to seek the support of Members to partner us in these efforts. Together, I hope that we can gradually change the attitudes and habits of households to reduce food waste.",8,9,013-001-094-030-021-009,879

2017-01-09,Radicalisation of Foreign Domestic Workers,013-001-094-030-022,Mr K Shanmugam,"  In the past two years, seven foreign domestic workers in Singapore were found to have been radicalised through the internet. They did not have plans to carry out acts of violence in Singapore at the time they were investigated. However, their interactions with others showed that they had bought into radical ideologies and were on a dangerous path. Their presence in Singapore posed a security concern. They were repatriated to their home countries.",1,2,013-001-094-030-022-002,881

2017-01-09,Challenges in Ramping Up HDB Flats Supply,013-001-094-030-023,Mr Lawrence Wong,"  Helping young couples own their first home is one of our key priorities. The ramp-up of Built-To-Order (BTO) flat supply between 2011 and 2014 has helped to clear the first-timer demand backlog. Most first-timers are now able to select a flat within their first or second application, and definitely on their third try. We will monitor the market closely and calibrate our flat supply to be responsive to the housing needs of Singaporeans.",1,2,013-001-094-030-023-002,885
2017-01-09,Challenges in Ramping Up HDB Flats Supply,013-001-094-030-023,Mr Lawrence Wong,"To shorten waiting time for flat buyers further, HDB has since 2011 been calling tender for many projects as soon as designs are ready, instead of the previous practice of doing so only after 70% of flats have been booked. Hence, waiting time today is mainly down to construction time. In this regard, HDB has also adopted various productivity measures in the design and construction phases, such as the use of precast technology, to expedite construction.",2,3,013-001-094-030-023-003,886
2017-01-09,Challenges in Ramping Up HDB Flats Supply,013-001-094-030-023,Mr Lawrence Wong,"In terms of challenges in ramping up new flat supply, immediate sites availability is one, as time is often needed to ensure that existing encumbrances and uses on the sites are cleared. There is also a need to ensure that there will be sufficient infrastructure capacity, such as transport, sewerage and drainage, to support the new housing developments.",3,4,013-001-094-030-023-004,887
2017-01-09,Challenges in Ramping Up HDB Flats Supply,013-001-094-030-023,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Nonetheless, we recognise that some young couples want a new home as quickly as possible. HDB is studying how we can advance the construction work of some BTO projects and build them ahead of their sales launches. While it is not feasible to do so for the entire flat supply due to land constraints and risk of over-supply, we can potentially do this for some projects every year. This will provide some flats with shorter waiting to cater to couples who need a new BTO flat more urgently.",4,5,013-001-094-030-023-005,888

2017-01-09,Improvements after Signalling System Upgrade at North-South and East-West MRT Lines,013-001-094-030-025,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked the Minister for Transport following the upgrade of the signalling system at the North-South and East-West MRT lines (a) what improvements have been observed; (b) what is the average interval between train arrivals during peak hours; and (c) what maintenance protocols are in place to ensure that the signalling system on the newer lines are always in optimal working condition.,1,1,013-001-094-030-025-001,891
2017-01-09,Improvements after Signalling System Upgrade at North-South and East-West MRT Lines,013-001-094-030-025,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"  The upgrade of the signalling system for the North-South Line will be completed by March this year, and that for the East-West Line by 2018. When the upgrade is completed, we will be able to run the trains closer together  one train every 100 seconds, compared to 120 seconds today. We will run the trains at this improved frequency during peak hours, effectively increasing the capacity of the two lines by 20 percent. Commuters can benefit from shorter waits and more comfortable rides.",1,2,013-001-094-030-025-002,892
2017-01-09,Improvements after Signalling System Upgrade at North-South and East-West MRT Lines,013-001-094-030-025,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Changing the signalling system is however a complex undertaking and we have been advised by other MRT operators, including the London Underground, to expect significant teething problems in the process. Thus, I had asked the Land Transport Authority and the operator SMRT to conduct much more extensive testing before switching to the new signalling system. Still, the experience elsewhere suggests that testing may not completely anticipate and eliminate the technical glitches that come when the system is fully loaded. We thus seek commuters' understanding and patience.",2,3,013-001-094-030-025-003,893

2017-01-09,Action against Illegal Gambling Dens,013-001-094-030-026,Mr K Shanmugam,"First, information-sharing between agencies. An inter-agency operations centre (IAOC) led by Police, has been established at the Geylang Neighbourhood Police Centre since May 2016. The IAOC allows multiple agencies to plan and execute enforcement operations in a coordinated manner. Take the example of the sale of duty-unpaid cigarettes, an issue which was raised by Ms Chia. The IAOC's CCTV camera feeds of Geylang allow Singapore Customs and Police to conduct surveillance, identify persons-of-interest, locate storage areas for duty-unpaid cigarettes, and mount joint-operations to apprehend illegal peddlers and seize the cigarettes.",7,8,013-001-094-030-026-008,902
2017-01-09,Action against Illegal Gambling Dens,013-001-094-030-026,Mr K Shanmugam,"Second, our enforcement agencies are deploying more technology to enhance their effectiveness at Geylang. The Police have installed more Police cameras and improved the lighting at the Geylang lorongs. A total of 171 cameras have been installed at Geylang since 2015. This is a fourfold increase from the 47 cameras in 2014. The increased street lighting and wider network of cameras enhance the deterrence and detection of illicit activities at back alleys and side lanes, including those mentioned by Ms Chia such as the peddling of duty-unpaid cigarettes and illegal gambling.",8,9,013-001-094-030-026-009,903
2017-01-09,Action against Illegal Gambling Dens,013-001-094-030-026,Mr K Shanmugam,"Third, to optimise the limited enforcement resources available, the various law enforcement agencies have pooled and re-organised existing auxiliary police officers into multi-skilled enforcement teams. Unlike single-agency teams which have a limited scope of enforcement, these multi-skilled teams allow officers to take action against multiple offences during each enforcement round, therefore delivering a greater impact on safety and security at Geylang with the same amount of resources. Since April 2016, the multi-skilled teams have performed high-visibility patrols at Geylang and enforced against a range of regulatory offences, including the supply of medicinal and health products without a valid licence, another area of concern raised by Ms Chia.",9,10,013-001-094-030-026-010,904

Anti-stick paint is applied on lamp-posts and other street infrastructures to make it more difficult for advertisements to be pasted on them.

In this regard, MENDAKI has developed and launched a Resource Depository to help parents navigate national resources on early childhood and learning. MENDAKI is also partnering the Early Childhood Development Agency to better support low-income and vulnerable families on KidSTART, so as to enable their young children to have a good start in life.

In return, Johor is entitled to a daily supply of treated water from Singapore ""not exceeding at any time two per cent of the total quantity of water supplied to Singapore from twelve midnight of any one day to twelve midnight of the following day"". In other words, Johor is entitled to buy up to about 5 mgd of treated water provided that Singapore is first able to abstract its entitlement of 250 mgd of water from the Johor River, and to subsequently import about 245 mgd of treated water in any given day. However, out of goodwill and without prejudice to our rights under the 1962 Water Agreement, Singapore has in practice supplied Johor with treated water in excess of Johor’s entitlement, even on occasions when PUB is unable to abstract its 250 mgd entitlement, for example during dry weather. Singapore has in fact been regularly supplying Johor with 16 mgd of treated water. In addition, we have supplied a further 5 to 6 mgd of treated water on a case-by-case basis at Johor's request during dry weather (for example in June and July 2016), as well as when Johor's water treatment plants are partially shut down for their monthly operational maintenance.",2,3,013-001-094-030-031-003,940

As a result, the water level in Linggiu Reservoir has dropped drastically over the past few years, from 84% at the start of 2015, to 49% at the start of 2016, to the lowest recorded level of 20% in October 2016. It stands at 27% as of 1 January 2017. There is a significant risk that Linggiu Reservoir may fail (ie, drop to 0%) in 2017 if it turns out to be a dry year. Should Linggiu Reservoir fail, there will be many more occasions when it will not be possible for PUB to abstract its entitlement of 250 mgd, and the current abstractions by Johor’s Semangar and Loji Air Water Treatment Plants will also be affected.

The Prime Ministers agreed on the importance of ensuring reliable and adequate water supply from the Johor River. The Malaysian Government reaffirmed its commitment to uphold Singapore's rights under the 1962 Water Agreement.

Although global growth is projected to improve marginally, the elasticity of trade to global growth is likely to remain weak due to factors such as the slowdown in investment growth in major advanced economies and China, as well as insourcing trends in China. This suggests that external demand for Singapore and regional countries may not see a significant uplift this year. Nonetheless, there are bright spots in the economy such as the education, health & social services, and information and communications sectors, which are likely to continue to see healthy growth.

The slower growth was partly due to the sluggish external environment, which had dampened productivity growth not just in Singapore but also in other developed economies. Our productivity growth has also been weighed down by the weak productivity performance of domestically-oriented sectors such as construction and food services, as well as a shift in employment towards these sectors.

2017-01-09,Complaint against EM Services for Refusal to Supply Lift Components,013-001-094-030-044,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"  The Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) first received a complaint against E M Services Pte Ltd (E M Services) in April 2014. After a preliminary enquiry, CCS commenced investigations. CCS subsequently conveyed its initial findings to E M Services. In September 2015, E M Services voluntarily committed to CCS that it would supply lift spare parts to any purchaser such as third party lift maintenance contractors. In assessing E M Services' commitments, CCS conducted public consultations and market tests to ensure that the commitments sufficiently addressed the competition concerns highlighted. In May 2016, CCS accepted E M Services' signed commitment. The duration of CCS' investigations in this case is similar to its past 3 investigations on Asia Pacific Breweries Singapore, Cordlife and Coca Cola which involved voluntary commitments.",1,2,013-001-094-030-044-002,1012

2017-01-09,Assessment of Deployment of Driverless Vehicles for Public Transport,013-001-094-030-045,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"  Self-driving technology indeed has the potential to transform public transport. For example, self-driving buses can help address the shortage of bus drivers. Self-driving pods or shuttles can be deployed at the neighbourhood level to further improve the first and last mile of a public transport journey. Commuters can summon these vehicles using their smartphones, and the vehicles will bring them in air-conditioned comfort from their doorsteps to the train station. This will be especially useful for the elderly, families with young children, and the less mobile.",1,2,013-001-094-030-045-002,1015

Nanyang Technological University (NTU) is developing self-driving buses for Singapore’s roads and climatic conditions. We expect the first on-road testing of NTU's self-driving buses to commence by the middle of 2018. A*STAR, Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART), Delphi Automotive Systems and nuTonomy are currently conducting self-driving trials in one-north Business Park which would be useful for first and last mile application. ST Engineering and Sentosa Development Corporation will be trialing a fleet of self-driving vehicles to ferry visitors within Sentosa, as Gardens by the Bay had done.

2017-01-09,Amount of Operating Subsidy for Public Bus Operators in 2017 under Bus Contracting Model,013-001-094-030-046,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"  Our public bus industry fully transitioned to the bus contracting model in September 2016. This includes the two packages of bus services awarded to Tower Transit and Go Ahead through open tenders and the twelve packages that are operated by the incumbent operators, SBST and SMRT. Over time, the operators of the twelve packages will also be appointed through open tenders, starting with that of the Seletar package to be awarded in 1Q 2017.",1,2,013-001-094-030-046-002,1019
2017-01-09,Amount of Operating Subsidy for Public Bus Operators in 2017 under Bus Contracting Model,013-001-094-030-046,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"Service levels have improved under the contracting model. Bus services now operate at scheduled headways of 15 minutes or less during peak hours. As operators compete for bus captains with improved remunerations and working conditions, more Singaporeans have been attracted to the industry. The number of Singaporean bus captains has increased from around 2,400 to 3,000 over the past year.",2,3,013-001-094-030-046-003,1020

After factoring in the recent fare reduction, we expect to incur $3.5 to $4 billion in subsidies for bus services over the next five years. To prevent the subsidies from ballooning over time, we will continue to impose cost discipline on the operators through regular competitive tenders, and also through regular rationalisation of bus services, where ridership is low and the commuters have shifted to new MRT lines. We must also maintain price discipline through regular fare adjustments.",3,4,013-001-094-030-046-004,1021

2017-01-09,Steps to Prevent Commercial Vehicles from Parking in Non-charging Parking Spaces,013-001-094-030-049,Mr Khaw Boon Wan,"  Roads in private residential estates are public roads. Hence, where parking is allowed along these roads, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) cannot forbid any individual or company from parking. LTA is open to suggestions from residents on how parking schemes can be improved to minimise inconvenience to them, but once instituted, these parking schemes will have to be uniformly applied to all vehicles.",1,2,013-001-094-030-049-002,1028

2017-01-09,Impact of Managed Care Companies and Third Party Administrator Companies on Healthcare Costs,013-001-094-030-068,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"  Managed care companies (MCCs) and third party administrator (TPAs) play a role in the healthcare system by providing information to patients and helping them with the administrative and claims processes. The Singapore Medical Council (SMC) is not prohibiting such services. The SMC's concern is with the charging practices adopted by some MCCs and TPAs, which compromise patient care and contribute to rising healthcare costs. For example, there are MCCs and TPAs which charge doctors referral fees of up to 25% of doctor’s fees. Their financial incentives are not aligned with the patient's interests as the decisions on referrals and care can be unduly influenced by the fee arrangements. In addition, the high referral fees will ultimately be borne by patients in the form of larger bill sizes or higher insurance premiums.",1,2,013-001-094-030-068-002,1097

The SMC has since revised their Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines to state that doctors must not allow financial arrangements to lead to any compromise in the care of patients. Any charges which doctors pay to MCCs or TPAs should commensurate with the actual administrative work done by these intermediaries in processing the cases, rather than based primarily on the fees charged to patients.

There are many factors which can contribute to increases in healthcare costs. For example, an ageing population and a higher rate of chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension will increase the volume and complexity of healthcare services. We are investing in health promotion initiatives to help Singaporeans lead healthy and active lives. Another priority is to provide appropriate care for patients by moving healthcare services beyond hospitals into the community, and to improve productivity and efficiency in our healthcare institutions. MOH is also working with the professional bodies and industry players to enhance information transparency on fees and charges, and to discourage over-servicing by healthcare providers.

SACs conduct activities such as outreach, home visits and centre-based activities, to encourage seniors to form social support networks and help detect risks early. An SAC is usually established when there is a reasonable number of seniors in the rental blocks. Larger centres are built in locations with more seniors within a cluster of rental blocks. MSF regularly reviews the planning and development of SACs, taking into account factors such as the projected elderly population in upcoming rental blocks, the SAC utilisation patterns and users' feedback. There is currently a total of five SACs in Bedok planning area, including one in Bedok South subzone.",2,3,013-001-094-030-071-003,1111

2017-01-09,Update on NEA's Rodent Control Efforts,013-001-094-030-075,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"  Since 2011, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has been carrying out regular inspections of public areas to identify potential food sources and harbourages for rodents, as well as rodent burrowing activities. Some 32,000 burrows were detected in the first 10 months of 2016, a 12.5% decrease over the same period in 2015. Around 90% of these burrows were found in housing estates managed by the Town Councils (TCs), mostly near bin chutes and bin centres. With numerous such facilities located in housing estates, rodent control remains a challenge for many TCs, especially in areas where individual stakeholders fail to adopt proper food storage and waste management practices, resulting in ample food sources for rodents.",1,2,013-001-094-030-075-002,1125

Last year, NEA calibrated the programme further to provide TCs with the flexibility to tailor specific rat control efforts according to the rodent situation in their respective housing estates. For instance, TCs can choose to adopt a combination of rodent control methods, such as population culling or burrow treatment. So far, 15 TCs have come on board the programme.",2,3,013-001-094-030-075-003,1126
2017-01-09,Update on NEA's Rodent Control Efforts,013-001-094-030-075,Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M,"In some areas, actions by one party to destroy rodent burrows may displace the rodents to another location. NEA has, therefore, taken steps to strengthen the coordination between multiple stakeholders by facilitating the formation of Rat Coordination Task Forces. These working groups, which also include the TCs, facilitate the coordination of rodent control plans amongst the various stakeholders and help ensure that all parties play their part. Progress has been encouraging, especially in areas such as Redhill Close, Clementi Ave 3, Bedok Central and Bangkit Road, where the number of burrows has fallen by more than 30% since coordination efforts began.",3,4,013-001-094-030-075-004,1127

Retail food establishments that fail to keep their premises free of rodent infestation could have their licences suspended or revoked. NEA also inspects shopping malls and requires the operators of such premises to put in place rodent control programmes and proper waste management practices.
