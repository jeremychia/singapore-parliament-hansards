2016-11-10,Impact on Singapore of Phase Three of US Rebalancing Strategy,013-001-094-029-002,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"  Mdm Speaker, as an independent and sovereign nation, Singapore pursues policies for its own interests for all matters of state, including defence, with the goal to attain the right and best conditions that ensure our survival and progress in this competitive world. We, Singaporeans, are ultimately responsible for our own security but we will partner like-minded countries that pursue common objectives of peace and stability for our region.",1,2,013-001-094-029-002-002,10
2016-11-10,Impact on Singapore of Phase Three of US Rebalancing Strategy,013-001-094-029-002,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"For this reason, Singapore joined the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) in 1971 which imposes an obligation on the five nations to consult in the event of an external attack on Malaysia and Singapore. In the past decade, we have also worked with other ASEAN countries to build a security architecture that is inclusive and based on the rule of law; where peaceful settlement of disputes, dialogue, cooperation and non-provocation are the norm for countries within that framework. This led to the set-up of ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting (ADMM)-Plus in 2010, which includes, apart from the ASEAN member states, China, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand from Asia, as well as the US and Russia.",2,3,013-001-094-029-002-003,11
2016-11-10,Impact on Singapore of Phase Three of US Rebalancing Strategy,013-001-094-029-002,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"As a matter of policy, Singapore will continue to partner like-minded countries to pursue peace and stability for our region. We seek to be friends with all militaries and encourage them to use our port and airbases for transit. Indeed, military ships and submarines from many countries, both from ASEAN-Plus countries like US, China, India and Japan as well as from other continents like Europe, South America, Oceania and Africa, stop and use facilities at Changi Naval Base.",3,4,013-001-094-029-002-004,12
2016-11-10,Impact on Singapore of Phase Three of US Rebalancing Strategy,013-001-094-029-002,The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen),"US ships and planes are more frequent users since the 1990 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed by our founding PM, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, and then-US Vice President Dan Quayle. That MOU facilitated the US' presence in this region and provided the security umbrella under which emerging economies in Asia thrived. The MOU was updated by the Strategic Framework Agreement by Prime Minister Lee and then-US President George W Bush in 2005. And recently, we enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement with the US in 2015.",4,5,013-001-094-029-002-005,13

2016-11-10,Impact on Singapore of Phase Three of US Rebalancing Strategy,013-001-094-029-002,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"  Madam, the main thrust of my response to the Member's questions is that Singapore must dictate its policies based on its own interests. That is our starting point. Our policy must work to the best of Singapore and Singaporeans.",1,7,013-001-094-029-002-007,15
2016-11-10,Impact on Singapore of Phase Three of US Rebalancing Strategy,013-001-094-029-002,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"Now, obviously, we have to watch what other countries do with foreign policy. Singapore is a small country and as I said in my answer, we will work with like-minded partners who pursue peace and stability in our region. In this framework, we have facilitated and pushed for ADMM-Plus. We push for joint cooperation and exercises with other countries, and we want to seek to have as many friends as possible. We encourage countries to use our facilities, whether it is Changi Naval Base or the airbases.",2,8,013-001-094-029-002-008,16
2016-11-10,Impact on Singapore of Phase Three of US Rebalancing Strategy,013-001-094-029-002,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"There are specific agreements that we have entered into.

2016-11-10,Impact on Singapore of Phase Three of US Rebalancing Strategy,013-001-094-029-002,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"We also have an MOU, a Strategic Framework Agreement and an enhanced DCA with the US, which facilitates the use of their ships and planes in our airbases.",4,10,013-001-094-029-002-010,18
2016-11-10,Impact on Singapore of Phase Three of US Rebalancing Strategy,013-001-094-029-002,Dr Ng Eng Hen,"To answer the many theoretical scenarios which the Member has raised, which I do not propose to address, I think our starting point is whatever the calculations of other countries, whatever their foreign policy, we start from this important fundamental â€“ we seek to make sure that Singapore benefits the most. Our foreign policy or defence policy is predicated on making sure that we position ourselves in the best possible position to survive and to compete. We want to make friends with as many militaries and countries as possible.",5,11,013-001-094-029-002-011,19

2016-11-10,Genetic Screening for Women Seeking Fertility Treatment,013-001-094-029-003,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"  Thank you. MOH had previously received requests to allow Pre-implantation Genetic Screening (PGS) to identify chromosomal abnormalities in embryos created through in-vitro fertilisation (IVF), with the aim of improving the chances of conceiving. We had not granted approval so far as the published evidence had been unclear. In recent years however, newer technologies for PGS have emerged and some jurisdictions have now allowed PGS.",1,5,013-001-094-029-003-005,24
2016-11-10,Genetic Screening for Women Seeking Fertility Treatment,013-001-094-029-003,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"MOH is therefore reviewing the clinical effectiveness of PGS and its ethical implications. To assess clinical effectiveness, NUH will be conducting a three-year pilot PGS programme which will commence by early next year.",2,6,013-001-094-029-003-006,25
2016-11-10,Genetic Screening for Women Seeking Fertility Treatment,013-001-094-029-003,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"MOH will also look into the ethical concerns and regulation of PGS. For example, we will need to ensure that embryos are not eliminated solely based on parental preferences on characteristics such as gender.",3,7,013-001-094-029-003-007,26

2016-11-10,Reduction in Hawker Stall Rent for Hawkers who Fall Ill,013-001-094-029-004,The Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"That said, when no other options are available, we do, from time to time, grant concessions where the circumstances are exceptional and worthy of compassion. For example, we have waived rent payments in a case where the stallholder was temporarily unable to operate his stall after he sustained serious injuries and had to undergo extensive medical treatment for a few months.",2,3,013-001-094-029-004-003,32
2016-11-10,Reduction in Hawker Stall Rent for Hawkers who Fall Ill,013-001-094-029-004,The Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan),"Ultimately, stallholders need to assess their own health and determine whether they are able or suited to work in the hawker trade. Those who are often medically unfit to work in the hawker trade may wish to transfer their stalls to their relatives and consider other employment options.",3,4,013-001-094-029-004-004,33

In doing so, NParks considers factors like the site condition and landscaping scheme.

2016-11-10,Decisions on Tree-cutting and Replanting Activities within Estates,013-001-094-029-005,Mr Desmond Lee,"  Madam, there are various factors that go into how NParks selects trees for planting, whatever the reason may be. In the Member's example, it is to replace a tree that had to be felled because it was ill and cannot be saved.",1,7,013-001-094-029-005-007,40
2016-11-10,Decisions on Tree-cutting and Replanting Activities within Estates,013-001-094-029-005,Mr Desmond Lee,"NParks, over the years, would have obtained lots of residents' feedback, feedback from municipal agencies as well about the maintainability of a tree, the risk structure of particular types of trees given their height, their crown and the incidence of branch falling or how frequently the leaves are shed, making things difficult for the cleaning companies; but also for biodiversity reasons. So, some street scape forms part of nature ways where we try to plant a variety of plans and tree species in order to provide connections between areas of biodiversity.",2,8,013-001-094-029-005-008,41
2016-11-10,Decisions on Tree-cutting and Replanting Activities within Estates,013-001-094-029-005,Mr Desmond Lee,"Of course, we look at considerations such as the ability to provide shade, screening for privacy, and the ability to survive urban environment stresses and ease of maintenance.",3,9,013-001-094-029-005-009,42

It is great to know that the welfare of our students are taken care of. I just have two supplementary questions, Mdm Speaker. One of them is how comprehensive is this insurance coverage for the students and is this coverage portable and is it, perhaps, extended up to a certain period of time?",1,5,013-001-094-029-006-005,51
2016-11-10,Policy on Students Getting Hurt on School Premises,013-001-094-029-006,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"The reason why I ask the Parliamentary Secretary is because, say, in a scenario where a student is in the last year of his time with the school, perhaps, Secondary 4 or Junior College 2 before they move on to the next level of their education, should they suffer bad injury like breaking their leg while playing football for the school, and then this injury may take some time to heal â€“ there may be follow-up operation, complications that may take a year or a year and a half later â€“ does the insurance plan that the MOE may have for the student then cover him or her, even though they may have left the particular MOE school and moved on to the next course of their life?",2,6,013-001-094-029-006-006,52

2016-11-10,Selective Relaxation on Total Debt Servicing Ratio Restrictions,013-001-094-029-007,The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"This is to help ensure that borrowers have sufficient cash income to meet their debt obligations. The 60% threshold applies to any property loan regardless of whether it is a loan for purchasing a property or a loan secured on an unencumbered property. Even with unencumbered private property as collateral, it is important that the borrower has sufficient cash income to meet the debt obligation. If the borrower fails to make repayment and defaults, the lender could seize and sell the property. This may not be a big problem for a wealthy borrower with several properties, but for someone who is living in that property, it can cause significant hardship.",2,3,013-001-094-029-007-003,64

I kind of expected that answer, but the reason I am highlighting it is because as the Minister mentioned, the TDSR formula is actually focused on income and does not take into account the assets that the potential borrower may have. We are seeing residents of ours in this current economic climate that have seen a drop in their income. They do believe that with the assets that they have, if there can be some relaxation where they can get a loan from a financial institution, they will be able to manage their overall indebtedness. Of course, in their view, the bank would be secured with their asset but they feel that they have other resources to manage such a loan. They need to manage their current liquidity challenges. I think this is a problem that MAS could look into.",1,5,013-001-094-029-007-005,66

2016-11-10,Selective Relaxation on Total Debt Servicing Ratio Restrictions,013-001-094-029-007,Mr Ong Ye Kung,"  There are some circumstances, for example if the borrower runs a company, is a sole proprietor or SME boss and the loan is raised in the name of the company, actually the TDSR does not apply.

2016-11-10,Telecommunications (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-029-010,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"Mdm Speaker, the TA must remain relevant and effective in regulating and providing for the development of our telecoms industry amidst rapid changes and recent developments. Since the last review in 2012, my Ministry has been keeping a close watch on how the industry has evolved, both locally and internationally, as well as the changing needs and demands of Singapore consumers. We have made three key observations.",3,4,013-001-094-029-010-004,135
2016-11-10,Telecommunications (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-029-010,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"First, the reliance on telecom services by consumers and businesses, especially for mobile telephone services, has increased dramatically over the last few years. Total mobile data usage has more than doubled since 2012, due to increased smartphone penetration and the use of data-intensive applications, such as mobile video streaming. Hence, consumers and businesses have come to expect more reliable and better quality service standards. To meet these rising demands, IMDA must have the ability to facilitate the continued deployment of telecoms infrastructure.",4,5,013-001-094-029-010-005,136

Madam, this should not be the case. It has been 16 years since the telecoms sector was fully liberalised. A key consideration for liberalisation was to allow end users more choice.

As we have experienced a recent spike in the number of cable cut incidents around Singapore, we wanted to send a clear and strong deterrent signal to would-be cable-cut offenders that they must follow the prescribed procedures for isolating telecom cables before commencing earthworks. Given the seriousness of cable-cut incidents and their adverse impact on end users, we have assessed that a more effective and targeted deterrent approach would be to focus on actively prosecuting and seeking harsher criminal sentences for such offences. This effort is underscored by IMDA's recent prosecution of a case which has led to Court fines totalling $165,000 in 2015.",8,9,013-001-094-029-010-009,140

However, IMDA has faced many practical challenges with building managers that have delayed timely deployments in the buildings they manage. To ensure COPIF's effectiveness, clause 2 will expressly clarify that parties who have control over the day-to-day management and operations of the building must also comply with COPIF. In practice, IMDA will continue to enforce COPIF requirements on the legal owner of the building in the first instance, before reaching out to building managers, such as the Management Corporations and Town Councils.",12,13,013-001-094-029-010-013,144

Clause 8 will provide greater certainty to building owners and occupiers on this notification and objection process. For example, before entering a building, licensees must first issue clear and accurate notifications to the building owner stating their intent and nature of the activities to be done, including whether they intend to use the space and facilities to serve any other building.",13,14,013-001-094-029-010-014,145
2016-11-10,Telecommunications (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-029-010,The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim),"In our dense urban environment, mobile deployments need to be sited at suitably high locations, such as building rooftops and towers, to optimise coverage of each mobile antenna. Accordingly, it is usually optimal for mobile operators to deploy their infrastructure on rooftops to serve multiple buildings from one location. This is known as ""spring-boarding"". Given the advantages that spring-boarding confers, clauses 9 and 10 will empower IMDA to establish a framework to further regulate and facilitate the use of and access to buildings for spring-boarding. Following these amendments, IMDA will consult affected stakeholders on amendments to COPIF to allow spring-boarding and other related operational details.",14,15,013-001-094-029-010-015,146

Madam, I would like to assure the House that this amendment will not prevent building owners from having promotional tie-ups with operators that end users can benefit from. This amendment simply prevents a building owner from denying end users the right to choose their preferred operator. The amendment is also not intended to apply to data centres, central offices and telecom exchanges, as their customers lease space to locate their equipment, and are not considered tenants or residents for the purpose of this provision.",15,16,013-001-094-029-010-016,147

Although no concerns were raised in relation to these powers during the public consultation, I wish to assure the House that IMDA will be reasonable, prudent and circumspect in the application of these powers, and that IMDA will take affected parties' concerns into account before making a decision. IMDA will also only narrowly apply these powers to specific contractual clauses that are inconsistent with the written notice or direction. In all other cases, these amendments to the TA will not affect the continuance of existing contracts, which should carry on until the expiry or termination.",16,17,013-001-094-029-010-017,148

Given that IMDA's regulatory powers for the telecom and media sectors are contained in the TA and IMDA Act respectively, clauses 17 and 21 will make amendments to both, to give IMDA powers to establish an ADR framework, as well as the rules, procedures, and operational mechanics of the ADR scheme. As I mentioned during the debate on the IMDA Bill in August this year, having telecom and media regulation in separate legislation is an interim measure, and my Ministry remains committed to the longer term approach of developing a holistic framework for the infocomm media sector through streamlined rules and regulations.",17,18,013-001-094-029-010-018,149

As such, participation in the ADR scheme will be made mandatory for service providers. Consumers, however, will have the flexibility to resolve their disputes through the ADR scheme, or through other avenues, such as the Courts or Small Claims Tribunal. IMDA is considering a suitable and independent operator for the ADR scheme, and will consult relevant stakeholders on the details of the scheme after the legislative framework is in place.",18,19,013-001-094-029-010-019,150

Clause 15 inserts a new section 32DA to empower IMDA to issue directions to enforce conditions of approval for mergers and acquisitions involving a designated telecoms licensee, business trust or designated trust.

Firstly, on the proposal in the Bill to empower IMDA to establish a framework for further regulating and facilitating access to rooftop space for the deployment of mobile equipment.

So, you do not clog up your rooftops with too many base stations or you have too many inline within the building repeater cells, for example. This may be especially important if they are moving to a new 5G network in the future based on new infrastructure, thus sharing may provide economies of scale for the operators and be more cost-effective for consumers, too.",3,32,013-001-094-029-010-032,163

I applaud this scheme but seek more clarity on how it will be implemented. Will the ADR scheme be administered by the Government? What sorts of disputes can consumers bring to the ADR operator? Will consumers have to pay for ADR services, and will the outcome of the ADR process be legally binding? How is the proposed ADR scheme different from some of the existing mediation channels available to consumers today, such as CASE or the Singapore Mediation Centre?

A nominal fee will also be paid by the subscribers because we want to dissuade frivolous claims. Although only approximately 400 disputes were escalated to IMDA in 2015, the actual number of disputes is likely to be higher, as some subscribers may have given up on pursuing their disputes. So, Madam, in order to contain the costs of running the ADR scheme and, of course, to ensure its sustainability, IMDA is exploring the possibility of appointing existing mediation service providers, such as the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE), to help us in rolling out the scheme.

Madam, as mentioned in my opening speech, the proposed amendments are to facilitate the deployment of telecoms infrastructure and are intended as general empowering provisions for IMDA. The details of how IMDA will operationalise these powers will still need to be studied in consultation with stakeholders, as the issues on the ground can be complex, and addressing them directly in legislation will not be straightforward.

Madam, I would like to reiterate that these amendments will not affect existing contracts which should carry on until their expiry. In relation to the Member's example of a mobile operator cancelling his existing contract in order to relocate to the same building so that they get rent-free, I understand that similar cases were raised when COPIF was first introduced in 2013. But since then, IMDA has not seen such cases being surfaced. Removing and reinstalling mobile equipment is, indeed, very expensive. Mobile operators are also hesitant to accept protracted disruptions to their mobile coverage while a new contract is being negotiated. The bottomline is that it is not in their favour to do the relocation.",9,92,013-001-094-029-010-092,223
2016-11-10,Telecommunications (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-029-010,Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,"Mr Zaqy and Mr Ong also asked how the optimal allocation of Mobile Deployment Space (MDS) and associated costs of mobile deployment on rooftops are determined. To clarify, Madam, the COPIF today already requires that building owners provide a specific amount of rent-free MDS to mobile operators upon request, and that mobile operators compensate the building owners for the associated costs of mobile deployments. And these costs may include security escorts to rooftop access, increasing load bearing capacity of the building, and the utility bills for running mobile equipment. So, with the proposed amendments, it is envisaged that building owners must provide rooftop space as MDS if the mobile operators request it. However, Madam, the total amount of MDS set aside, the principles of allocating MDS amongst multiple mobile operators, and the framework for compensating costs associated with the mobile deployments will remain consistent with existing COPIF practices for a start. Any unresolved dispute between the building owners and mobile operators over issues, such as competing uses or compensation, can also be escalated to IMDA. IMDA will then work with relevant agencies to strike a balance between the property rights of the building owners and the provision of good quality telecom services to the public. So, whenever there are disputes, we will step in. We will basically bring the parties in and see what is the best solution possible. I agree with the Member that we need to provide the best coverage possible for our consumers.",10,93,013-001-094-029-010-093,224

I would like to share with this House that it is already being practised. In fact, IMDA facilitates the sharing of certain infrastructure amongst licensees where it is technically challenging to replicate or there are physical constraints. And this includes the sharing of spaces on existing monopoles and cell towers, as well as sharing mobile deployments in places, such as MRT tunnels. For MDS in buildings, the COPIF currently limits the total amount of mobile deployment spaces that is set aside.

On average, Madam, IMDA receives about 30 such objections every year from building owners or occupiers involved in this process. IMDA has been able to resolve most cases through informal mediation, without having to issue any formal directions for the works to be carried out. As for timelines, the TA does not state a fixed timing for resolving disputes. Each case is unique, and IMDA will set a reasonable amount of time for all parties to reach a happy resolution. Thereafter, if the dispute remains unresolved, the telecommunication licensee will inform IMDA, and IMDA will typically hold an inquiry within the next 14 days. So, we will step in as quickly as possible to make sure we can resolve the dispute.",12,95,013-001-094-029-010-095,226

First, I would like to take this opportunity to clarify that Singapore has a liberalised telecommunications market whereby IMDA does not impose restrictions on foreign ownership and control in telecommunications licensees. However, IMDA does maintain oversight over such transactions and appointments to ensure that they do not cause significant harm to market competition, consumers and public interest. And Alex Yam raised his concern about section 32(d). I wish to clarify that the amendments will specify the exact laws which can be overridden by directions issued under section 32(d). This is narrower than the existing section 32(d) as directions could previously take effect despite any written law.

The answer is  different parts of the pipeline network are owned and managed by different parties and, accordingly, the appropriate licensee for each part will necessarily be different. We want to ensure that where pipelines run together, there is a single party that is accountable for that segment of the pipelines, rather than having different licensees being responsible for different pipelines that, in effect, run parallel to each other and lying side by side. However, where some pipelines branch off into an adjacent corridor owned and managed by another party, then that party is the most appropriate person to be licensed for that segment of pipelines running along his corridor.",4,31,013-001-094-029-011-031,266

A person's appearance can change over time. A person's fingerprints may also wear out over time as he gets older, or if he does a lot of manual work. ICA has received feedback from some travellers who found it difficult to use the automated clearance gates at the checkpoints. Poor fingerprint quality could also be a reason. These travellers had to be directed to the manned counters instead. This has been a source of intrigue, and sometimes even frustration to these travellers, and also to fellow travellers queuing up behind them to use the automated lanes.",12,13,013-001-094-029-012-013,285

Once implemented, persons can continue to use ICA's automated facilities at the checkpoints, even if their fingerprints may have faded over time. This will smoothen the immigration clearance process for individuals, and also benefit other travellers, by reducing overall queue times.

This gives search, seizure and use of force powers to national registration officers, which the Senior Minister of State would confirm would be ICA officers only and not private sector persons, but, nevertheless, therefore extending police powers to another group of personnel outside of the police. I would like to record my concern on this point. Is this extension of police powers really necessary or desirable?

There is a global movement in several countries to tighten registration and security. Brazil has recently announced plans to share biometric data from their electoral registry with the federal government for a unified Brazilian identity card project. This is unprecedented in South America. Japanese tech firm NEC has also developed new technology biometric scanners to identify even new-borns and infants to monitor vaccination rates in developing countries. A prototype has run in India and it was used to capture biometric information from 300 children. In the Straits Times on the 5 November, it was also pointed out by a senior cyber security official that the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence that Singapore can be a model for building a resilient national critical information infrastructure with regard to national data registration.",1,64,013-001-094-029-012-064,336

2016-11-10,National Registration (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-029-012,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Firstly, on the safety of the data collected, as have been previously raised by my fellow colleague. There has been many discussions about the collection of biometric data, since identify theft and security breaches are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Iris scans are especially sensitive because it is so powerful. The most advanced scanners can identify many people in a split second, even from a long-range. The data is almost fool-proof, and is permanent. If this data falls into the hands of people with mal-intentions, the consequences can be dangerous. The public could have questions on how secure the database will be, whether third parties, apart from the Government, will have access to the data, and so on. There will always be teething issues with the introduction of any new technology, especially one as personal as this, and we should have ready answers. In this light, can the Minister share plans on how it will ensure that the new data collected will be secure? How does the Ministry plan to satisfy the public about this?",6,79,013-001-094-029-012-079,351
2016-11-10,National Registration (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-029-012,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Secondly, on user acceptance. Some people might be skeptical â€“ even fearful â€“ of new technology like this, which could be seen as a page out of a science fiction novel. For the older generation, there could be misconceptions â€’ will it hurt my eyes, does it involve lasers? For the younger generation, there could be discomfort from what they see as additional Government ""surveillance"". Certainly, the technology has been tried and tested, but how does the Ministry plan to educate the public to debunk these myths?",7,80,013-001-094-029-012-080,352

I have read that iris scanners are able to detect stress through indicators, such as movement of the eyeballs. Once stress is detected, the system will immediately alert authorities. If this is truly available, it would be a real step-up for security at our checkpoints. Can the Minister share if the iris imaging technology we will acquire can provide this extra layer of security?",8,81,013-001-094-029-012-081,353

2016-11-10,National Registration (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-029-012,Mr Desmond Lee,"Mr Leon Perera asked about whether there would be processes beyond what I have just identified for the enrolment of irises. At this point in time, in order to minimise inconvenience to members of the public, we are limiting enrolment to those interfaces that ICA already has with members of the public â€’ registration at 15, and re-registration in subsequent years. And of course, when a person applies for a passport, there will also be another opportunity and touch-point to enrol the iris. This would necessarily mean that enrolment of the entire population will take quite some time. But let us start with the initial touch points first. That will already allow large numbers of Singaporeans and PRs to have their iris images enrolled.",19,116,013-001-094-029-012-116,388
2016-11-10,National Registration (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-029-012,Mr Desmond Lee,I will move on to the appointment of non-ICA employees as registration officers. Many Members spoke about this. Mr Alex Yam and Mr Melvin Yong asked why non-ICA employees should be appointed as registration officers. Mr Leon Perera asked whether these non-ICA employees would be subjected to the Official Secrets Act and other forms of security measures and undertakings. Mr Alex Yam asked if this was a productivity measure.,20,117,013-001-094-029-012-117,389
2016-11-10,National Registration (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-029-012,Mr Desmond Lee,"Mdm Speaker, ICA's objective is to partner other agencies and the private sector to deliver certain registration services more conveniently to the public, specifically to provide services at more locations. ICA will be highly selective about what we appoint non-ICA employees to do. These may include functions, such as the issuance of NRICs and enrolling of iris images. They will not be appointed to perform sensitive functions that require them to access, retrieve or alter individuals' personal information in ICA's records.",21,118,013-001-094-029-012-118,390
2016-11-10,National Registration (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-029-012,Mr Desmond Lee,"ICA has also put in safeguards. This includes strict user-access controls to prohibit non-ICA employees from accessing, retrieving or altering any information, such as an individual's personal records from ICA's systems. Personal information collected by these employees will also be transmitted directly to ICA. Non-ICA employees will not be allowed to edit the information. Their role is to guide the public through the enrolment process and not to manage the information collected.",22,119,013-001-094-029-012-119,391
2016-11-10,National Registration (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-029-012,Mr Desmond Lee,"For greater accountability, ICA will only appoint full-time staff of these entities as registration officers. Private entities will be required to submit to ICA, the particulars of each employee whom they intend to appoint with these registration duties. And each of them will have to be individually appointed as a registration officer by the Commissioner of ICA. This will be done only after ICA has assessed the entity and each individual for their suitability, and conduct necessary screening measures. So, apart from the suitability of the institution, the individuals, Mr Leon Perera asked whether there will be a privacy impact assessment or security impact assessment conducted. The entire framework will be put under scrutiny in order to ensure that privacy is secured. In addition, under a new section 3A, these officers and individuals who are appointed by Commissioner of ICA will be deemed to be public servants for the purposes of the Penal Code.",23,120,013-001-094-029-012-120,392

2016-11-10,National Registration (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-029-012,Mr Desmond Lee,"Madam, I will now move on to the powers to refuse the registration of certain types of names. Mr Alex Yam said that parents should think of the consequences of giving undesirable names to their children, and asked if ICA could come up with a set of guidelines on allowable names. Mr Leon Perera wanted to know if time would be given to parents who register names that may not be registered under these new rules; instead of being compelled to make a decision there and then, on the spot.",25,122,013-001-094-029-012-122,394
2016-11-10,National Registration (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-029-012,Mr Desmond Lee,"I will deal with that first â€’ Mr Leon's point. Certainly, this is a very important decision for parents and will affect the children all through their lives. The kinds of names to give is not an issue that we expect parents to take lightly. Neither do we want to put them in a position to be rushed. So, certainly, in the rare instance where the name suggested may not comply with the rules, the officers will give the parents ample time to reconsider. Even with the registration of a child's birth, there is a period of time given to parents to make that registration.",26,123,013-001-094-029-012-123,395
2016-11-10,National Registration (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-029-012,Mr Desmond Lee,"Madam, we fully agree that names should be given responsibly and that has, indeed, been ICA's experience so far. So, in response to Mr Leon Perera's question about how often we see such inappropriate names or names existing 66 characters, the answer is very few and far between. This is the power that is embedded in the registration legislation of many other developed countries. The legislative language referencing public interest also exists in these other countries. ICA does not intend to prescribe a set of guidelines on allowable names, since the vast majority of names are registered without issue. It is not our intention to regulate the kinds of names parents choose for their children.",27,124,013-001-094-029-012-124,396
2016-11-10,National Registration (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-029-012,Mr Desmond Lee,"Instead, ICA will assess each name at the point of registration to ensure that they do not flout the conditions stipulated in the new section 6A. And names that do not meet the mark will be refused registration. The Commissioner may also refuse to register names that are obscene or offensive. The Commissioner will have to carefully consider each case on its own merits before he exercises his discretionary powers to refuse registration, a power which ought to be exercised sparingly.",28,125,013-001-094-029-012-125,397
2016-11-10,National Registration (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-029-012,Mr Desmond Lee,"Mr Leon Perera asked for examples of names that could possibly flout public interest. I have given a few earlier. Those that used titles like ""Sir"", ""Professor"", ""President""; names that are offensive or that use expletives. One other example could be names that could possibly be deemed derogatory or highly offensive to any particular race or religion. Again, bearing in mind that this is the parents' right to express the kind of name they would like for their children to carry through their life, we will exercise these powers very sparingly and carefully.",29,126,013-001-094-029-012-126,398
2016-11-10,National Registration (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-029-012,Mr Desmond Lee,"Madam, Mr Patrick Tay asked if ICA can provide NRIC replacements at selected intervals of a person's lifetime due to fair wear and tear and outdated photographs. While Mr Leon Perera asked whether ICA can give more assurance to people who have lost their NRICs, especially if they are impecunious or unable to afford the fee for replacements â€’ either the first or subsequent replacements.",30,127,013-001-094-029-012-127,399
2016-11-10,National Registration (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-029-012,Mr Desmond Lee,"Let me deal with the second query first. ICA considers each application for waiver holistically, taking into account a range of factors. ICA will consider waiving the replacement fees fully or partially for cases where the loss of IC was not through negligence but due to circumstances beyond the cardholder's control. For example, their wallet was stolen or they faced financial difficulties.",31,128,013-001-094-029-012-128,400
2016-11-10,National Registration (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-029-012,Mr Desmond Lee,"Madam, we certainly understand that NRICs are critical for many functions â€’ whether interfacing with Government or in daily life in Singapore. The loss of an NRIC poses not just inconvenience to the individual but also tremendous risks to him or her in terms of identity theft. People could use their ICs to borrow from loan sharks. Identity thefts could also pose national security risks. Criminals, syndicates or even terrorist organisations could use Singapore identity documents or NRICs maliciously. Therefore, it is important to reflect proper safekeeping of the NRIC in the law. We balance the need to emphasise that responsibility with the ability of people to afford the replacement fees. In relation to affordability, I have given the Member the answer that ICA will assess each case based on the person's circumstances and the circumstances under which the identity card was lost.",32,129,013-001-094-029-012-129,401
2016-11-10,National Registration (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-029-012,Mr Desmond Lee,"In relation to Mr Patrick Tay's earlier question, currently, a person registers and receives his first NRIC at the age of 15 and he then has to re-register to receive a second NRIC at 30, with an updated photograph. ICA is looking at introducing another NRIC re-registration at a later phase of a cardholder's life so that the information captured, such as the photograph, will be more up-to- date. ICA will release more details in due course.",33,130,013-001-094-029-012-130,402
2016-11-10,National Registration (Amendment) Bill,013-001-094-029-012,Mr Desmond Lee,"Finally, Madam, Mr Leon Perera also asked about the explanatory statement of the Bill which refers to that the Bill will not result in any increase in public expenditure. This is indeed the case. The enactment of the Bill and its execution will not cause increase in public expenditure itself. Because when ICA puts the systems in place, MHA will include this amount as part of the Supply Bill and we will reflect that expenditure under that Bill.",34,131,013-001-094-029-012-131,403

Currently, it costs six to nine months, and $5,000 to $7,000 of legal fees to achieve that, which could be a burden to some foster parents. So, if MSF is empowered to recommend legal guardianship as needed, we can cut out unnecessary costs.",13,71,013-001-094-029-013-071,481
2016-11-10,Child Development Co-Savings (Amendment No 2) Bill,013-001-094-029-013,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Next, I would like to talk about easing the financial burden on adoptive parents. Let me share on the state of adoption today. There is less adoption than it used to be. In 2014, 352 children have been adopted, which is a sharp drop from 732 a decade ago. The number of adoption agencies has also halved. For Singaporeans that embark on the adoption process, it is a costly process. Why? Well, there are not many children available for adoption locally, as many unwanted pregnancies have resulted in abortions. So, many potential adoptive parents have to look at adopting overseas, especially if they want someone who can fit well into their family circumstances. However, internationally, many countries are strengthening their adoption guidelines, and understandably so. The net effect is that the cost of adopting overseas, usually through an agent, has gone up considerably. I was told that the cost ranges from $25,000 to $50,000 to adopt from overseas.",14,72,013-001-094-029-013-072,482

Firstly, perhaps our Government can consider providing a small grant to subsidise foreign adoption cost for Singaporean couples who have failed repeatedly to conceive. Why? Even after the recent generous increase in subsidies for IVF in public hospitals, many Singaporean couples who tried unsuccessfully to conceive have to still incur costly and repeated IVF treatment, especially if they do so in a private hospital. These couples would also have drawn down on their Medisave funds. As such, a small grant to offset this cost, perhaps helping all but couples in high-income brackets, would be welcomed.",15,73,013-001-094-029-013-073,483

For example, there is a pair of grandparents from Kebun Baru, whose daughter, a single mother herself, has passed on. So, this pair of grandparents are striving their best to be adoptive parents to their grandson. They are both in their 60s and 70s. They are both struggling to have full-time jobs, so that they can support their grandson who is also their adopted son.

Enhancements have been made to grant fathers of adoptive children two weeks of paternity leave. While unwed mothers are now entitled to full maternity leave of 16 weeks, are there considerations made to allow unwed fathers to enjoy the same?

Female employees who are pregnant or on maternity leave are protected by law from being dismissed or retrenched. Can the protection be extended beyond pregnancy and maternity leave period so as to give security and assurance to mothers who return to work after childbirth? The transition back to work after maternity leave ends is not an easy period as they learn to cope with balancing demands of work and the needs of their babies. While they were away, their jobs may have been re-allocated by employers and upon their return, these mothers may face possibilities of re-deployment or even redundancy.

Studies have shown that women choose to leave the workforce mainly due to family commitments and whether they are raising children or caring for elderly dependants, their contribution is invaluable to our society and nation's development. However, the work that these women are doing goes unpaid and they are relying on financial resources of their spouses and loved ones alone.

As educational standards of workforce rises and women choosing to have children later, more and more who leave the workforce are PMEs in mid-career. This loss to the talent pool can be mitigated by enabling seamless transition of these women back to work. While many of their skills may have become outdated or irrelevant in the many years when they were at home, these PME women do possess skills and experience which can be transferable to new jobs. Various Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) targeted at mid-career PMEs can be enhanced to make the jobs more attractive to back-to-work PMEs, the women especially, in terms of pay, career prospects and flexibility in work arrangements.",8,94,013-001-094-029-013-094,504

Besides the Career Support Programme and Professional Conversion Programme, to give confidence to these women and also potential employers, I suggest the introduction of a Returnship Programme spanning four to six months to facilitate the matching of women jobseekers and employers. During the Returnship period, women jobseekers are given guidance and training to update their skills, better understand the job and ascertain her suitability for the position. Upon successful completion of Returnship, women jobseekers can embark on PCP for further training to make the career switch.

Expansion of leave to single parents and adoptive parents are laudable, perhaps timely to also consider extension of child care leave to foster parents fostering young children so that they can spend time helping the foster children to settle into their new home.

The tremendous efforts these families undertook to adopt the children from overseas impressed upon me that it is not the financial aids that we provide that is material to them, but the acknowledgement from society that they are akin to the child's natural parents for their love in raising the child as though it is their own and also the fairness in including them under such benefit schemes that really makes the difference.",2,100,013-001-094-029-013-100,510

Furthermore, they believe strongly in shared parenting. In fact, gender stereotypes on child-caring is evolving. It is already archaic to think that only women must bear the primary care-giving role. Legislating a second week of paternity leave and allowing for shared parental leave of up to four weeks cater for such demand and change.

While I am glad for these provisions, I am cautious for the eventual consumption of additional week of paternity leave or shared parental leave. Only 40% of our fathers used their one week of paid paternity leave last year. This shows that our families might face structural problems. Common anecdotally-evidenced gaps include the lack of support from employers, especially smaller companies which might genuinely face operational constraints. Fathers with reservist duties are also hesitant to take leave. In fact, some employers have commented it is difficult to support two types of national service.

Similar to maternity and paternity leave, adoption leave is intended to support parents of infants in the first year of delivery. Beyond the child's infancy, all working parents â€“ including adoptive parents â€“ can take six days each of paid childcare leave when the child is below age seven, and six more days of unpaid infant care leave when the child is below age two, to spend more time to bond with their children.",11,162,013-001-094-029-013-162,572

He suggested a grant to offset foreign adoption costs for couples who have failed repeatedly to conceive. As the focus of adoption is to find a suitable family for a child, subsidising the fees charged by commercial adoption agencies is not the right solution, we think, in terms of protecting the best interests of the child. Mr Kwek also suggested allowing single parents who were previously married and adopted a related child to benefit from the Parenthood Tax Rebate.

I agree with Mr Kwek that we should make it easier for foster parents to discharge their parenting responsibilities. We have about 400 foster parents caring for over 400 children today. Mr Kwek mentioned about the Bao Lady. In fact, I visited her and spoke to her and her family. They are really quite amazing. I visited various foster families as well. It is really quite encouraging to see families with such capacity to love, not just for their children but for many children over many years. It really makes a difference for these children whose families may not be ready to take them in and look after them for a period. Foster parents play a very significant role. We are heartened to see that Singaporeans are willing to go that extra mile to care for vulnerable children. We certainly want to encourage more Singaporeans to come on board to be foster parents. We will certainly keep the suggestions in mind as we continue to develop foster care.",13,164,013-001-094-029-013-164,574

Mr Patrick Tay asked if the Government would consider putting in place Returnship Programmes to help match women jobseekers and employers. He also suggested providing an Income Supplement to stay-at-home mothers and for Workfare Scheme benefits to be extended to a select group of such young mothers. I think this is an idea that we can consider, though we should take a hard look at all the current job-matching services and to minimise duplication of efforts.

Today, eligible stay-at-home mothers already enjoy all the measures under the Marriage and Parenthood package except understandably, those related to employment such as leave benefits.

Mr Tay asked to extend protection beyond pregnancy and maternity leave for female employees. We will work with tripartite partners in the next round of review to study this, while being mindful not to change the laws so drastically that it results in unintended consequences such as resentment against mothers and impact on gender bias; because this could impact on their employability.

Firstly, she asked what measures will be taken to ensure that workers who are terminated without just cause know their leave entitlements upon termination of employment. MOM encourages to implement fair and non-discriminatory employment practices.

The weekly index simplifies the provisions of the Act, and does not change entitlement. A self-employed person who works seven days a week, and takes the full maternity leave continuously, will be paid based on seven days a week. Where maternity leave is taken flexibly, it will be based on the number of days she works in a week, or 48 days, whichever is lower.

Ms Thanaletchimi said that employees whose services are terminated with just cause cease to be entitled to Adoptive Leave, Government-Paid Maternity Leave and Government-Paid Paternity Leave. I would like to clarify that a woman only forfeits Government-Paid Maternity Benefit, and even then, only for the relevant employment period where she is dismissed with sufficient cause. If she had worked satisfactorily in other jobs in the 12 months preceding delivery, she can still receive a Government-Paid Maternity Benefit amount based on income earned from those jobs.",23,174,013-001-094-029-013-174,584

We are mindful that low-income families face more challenges in saving into the CDA. This is why we have introduced the CDA First Step of $3,000 earlier this year. This is directly provided into newly-opened CDAs, without parents having to save first. We also reach out to lower income families through touch-points such as the Social Service Offices and Family Service Centres, to increase awareness about the CDA.",25,176,013-001-094-029-013-176,586

One such example is the OCBC Starter Scheme, which was introduced in 2012 and will end in December 2016. Under this scheme, if lower income parents saved $50 in the CDA, OCBC would contribute $100 into the account. As Government provides matching contribution of $150, the children will effectively receive co-savings of $250 in return for the $50 saved.",26,177,013-001-094-029-013-177,587

Shared parental leave also provides parents the flexibility to decide and to choose their leave arrangements to care for their newborns, based on their respective family's circumstances.

Parents sometimes do not know what impact their comparisons have on their children. In some situations, the child loses confidence in his ability and he starts to wonder if he will be unloved by his parents the moment he fails to meet their expectations.

With the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the USSR, many of these shipping companies have struggled to survive. Their crew even had to arrest their own ships to sue for their own unpaid wages.

When companies collapse, they can leave crew stranded onboard with wages unpaid, and sometimes even without funding for repatriation and in some situations, even without provisions, as fleet management take time to work out solutions for the crew as well as with creditors.

It may not be convenient for the crew given the way ship operations are run. Vessels have tight turn-around time and may not have much time in port. Crew may need to man the vessel even when the ship is in port. In some situation, the master may not grant permission for crew to go ashore. Sometimes, the owners or their agents may not allow the crew to go ashore and the agents' co-operation is required as they need to get the paperwork from local port authorities and also arrange for harbour launches to go to the anchorages to pick the crew which can be costly to the crew.",9,35,013-001-094-029-014-035,641

If ship owners give up their ships, refused to pay crew wages and let the ships be sold via judicial sale, all creditors will compete for a share of the sale proceeds.

If the outstanding wages exceed four months, the crew may still need to instruct their own lawyers to effect recovery of their unsecured amount. Hence, this convention does not fully assist the crew with unpaid wages of more than four months. There are a small number of ship owners, whose crew may not be paid wages on a regular basis. They may, for example, be paid their full wages at the end of the contract term, which can be a few years. Meantime, they may be given, say, a small allowance. They may use such allowance to buy daily necessities.",18,44,013-001-094-029-014-044,650

The crew's only option will be to leave the vessel and instruct lawyers to file a claim in court. But the crew may not have the funds to do so. Some of the crew may even have entered into one-sided contracts with manning agents. Included in this category, are some fishing fleets, which I understand come into Singapore port for various reasons. These are not Singapore registered vessels. They are foreign-owned and have foreign crew. For the crew on these vessels, sadly, this Convention may be academic to them and will not really improve their lot.",19,45,013-001-094-029-014-045,651

The crew can only make any claim on the MLC certificates if they are still serving on board. It brings the possibility of owners repatriating seafarers by giving false assurances that outstanding wages of claims will be paid after repatriation. But once repatriated, the financial security may no longer assist the seafarers. And the seafarers will have to engage lawyers to pursue their claims.",22,48,013-001-094-029-014-048,654

There is adequate food, water and medical supplies onboard the vessel. We know this because the unions, together with the Maritime Port of Authority (MPA), made an inspection.

Seafarers can use the satellite phone or the internet onboard the ship to get in touch with the MPA to raise any matter of concern. I know that Mr Tan highlighted that, sometimes, the ship owners or the ship managers may make things very difficult for the seafarers. And that is a very valid point, which is why I think it is very important to work with our unions. Work with our unions to educate the seafarers and also to provide to them alternative avenues of feedback, alternative avenues where they can raise their grievances. So, that is something that we take very seriously. Work in partnership with the unions to make sure that the seafarers' rights are not only protected on paper, that they are, in effect, properly protected. Should any owner of a Singapore-registered ship fall short of fulfilling its obligations, MPA can take court action to impose financial penalties or even de-register the ship from the Singapore Registry.",11,82,013-001-094-029-014-082,688

And a ship may be detained when it is found to be non-compliant with international conventions, including the MLC. And to the point that you made, consistent enforcement is absolutely right. I fully agree with you. And MPA carries out regular spot-checks to make sure that the MLC certificates are, in fact, being procured properly. And if the MPA has reason to suspect that any vessel, whether they are flagged in Singapore or elsewhere, are not in compliance with any of these international conventions, then the MPA will do whatever it can to make sure that these ship owners are taken to task.",12,83,013-001-094-029-014-083,689
