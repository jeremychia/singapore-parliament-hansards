Is the main objective of SGN Funding Programme to encourage Singaporean talent abroad to return to Singapore and contribute to our economy and our society.

And there are close to 300 partners that collaborate with the SGN on various partnership initiatives, to do a few things and the aim of SGN is to do a few things  one, to promote networking and collaboration amongst Singaporeans and friends of Singapore; two, connect the community of family and friends of Singapore; and three, at the same time, also to provide platforms to share about opportunities and development in Singapore and Southeast Asia.",3,9,014-001-095-087-001-009,9

Does SGN work closely with our Missions abroad to engage Singaporeans on domestic and foreign policy issues that matter to them overseas as well as their families back home? This is related to also my cut on Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) later no engaging Singaporeans on foreign policy.,1,15,014-001-095-087-001-015,15

Since the launch in August 2020, the SGN has replaced the Overseas Singaporeans Unit and is now sitting with the Economic Development Board. As part of that, the SGN team will work closely with not just the economic agencies but also with MFA and our Missions as well, to allows Singaporeans, even though they cannot come back – for example, in the last three years, whether they are in Beijing or in other cities in Australia and the US – that they have a way to stay connected to Singapore and at the same time, to also understand the various refinements to the policies, and the current affairs as well.",1,16,014-001-095-087-001-016,16

However, there are no plans to pursue this aim through legislation. Our public communications policy calls for plain language so that messages are clear and accessible for members of the public. The Government Instruction Manual requires all public servants to write well and speak clearly. Communication is an essential function of public service and we need to do so in all four of our official languages.",1,2,014-001-095-087-002-002,18

However, introducing legislation is not the answer. Instead we will pursue this aim through education, training, role-modelling and holding ourselves to high standards. The experience in other countries where legislation has been introduced suggests that our approach has merit.",2,3,014-001-095-087-002-003,19

I just have one supplementary question, which is that, would the Government consider launching a whole-of-Government movement to simplify language in Government communications in a very concerted manner that is regularly reviewed.",1,6,014-001-095-087-002-006,22

2023-02-27,Plain Language Legislation for Clarity and Accessibility,014-001-095-087-002,Mr Leon Perera,"  Yes. I received this letter from a particular agency and I am just going to read out this one sentence  ""We have reviewed your case and we regret to inform you that we are unable to accede to your request as the evidence supports the offence disclosed.""",1,9,014-001-095-087-002-009,25
2023-02-27,Plain Language Legislation for Clarity and Accessibility,014-001-095-087-002,Mr Leon Perera,"I do not mean to be too prescriptive but, for example, you could reword this and say, ""We have reviewed the facts and we are sorry that we cannot agree to your request because there is not enough proof."" This is an example. For many Singaporeans who receive Government communications, English may not always be their first language. So, I think my clarification is, would the Government consider implementing much more simplified communications in its letters and so on to Singaporeans, as a whole-of-Government effort.",2,10,014-001-095-087-002-010,26
2023-02-27,Plain Language Legislation for Clarity and Accessibility,014-001-095-087-002,Dr Janil Puthucheary,"  Mr Speaker, I agree with Mr Leon Perera that we do need to simplify our communications and aim for clarity, wherever possible. We also do have to make sure that there is precision and accuracy in the statements. These are tensions that Government officers will require training and support, but I can assure Mr Perera we have the same intent.",1,11,014-001-095-087-002-011,27

2023-02-27,Distinction between Social and Illegal Carpooling,014-001-095-087-003,The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for Transport),"However, if the carpooling is among strangers, that is, the passenger does not know the driver, then, in the interest of both drivers and passengers, this must be done via licensed carpooling operators, for example by booking GrabHitch or RydePool services; or through other smaller operators. In such cases, operators are required to verify drivers’ licences and enforce a maximum of two carpool journeys a day at cost recovery. Details of booked trips are also recorded by operators, which can be used to aid investigations in the event of an incident or a dispute. Illegal carpooling trips matched through other platforms such as Telegram chat groups do not have such safeguards. We would urge members of the public to book their journeys only with carpooling operators.",2,3,014-001-095-087-003-003,31

2023-02-27,Distinction between Social and Illegal Carpooling,014-001-095-087-003,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),  I thank the Senior Minister of State for her reply. I have two supplementary questions. Will social carpooling individuals be put in a difficult situation if LTA tightens regulations towards illegal carpooling and how effective is LTA's enforcement in differentiating between the two practices?,1,6,014-001-095-087-003-006,34
2023-02-27,Distinction between Social and Illegal Carpooling,014-001-095-087-003,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Second, as many carpooling groups can operate through chatgroups such as Telegram, how does the Ministry of Transport (MOT) intend to leverage technology and work with the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) to monitor such groups?",2,7,014-001-095-087-003-007,35
2023-02-27,Distinction between Social and Illegal Carpooling,014-001-095-087-003,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"  I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. Firstly, as I have mentioned earlier, to ensure commuter safety, we have limited the matching of carpooling services with strangers to be done only via licensed carpooling operators or the smaller operators, that means business entities that are carpooling operators, because these operators maintain records of the drivers as well as the trips booked, in case of a dispute or an incident. In the past, we have had reports of disputes as well as assault cases arising from unregulated carpooling services.",1,8,014-001-095-087-003-008,36
2023-02-27,Distinction between Social and Illegal Carpooling,014-001-095-087-003,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"But social carpooling arrangements – generally made between friends or colleagues, typically no payment made – are permitted. LTA will only take enforcement actions against drivers who are found to have completed these carpooling trips with strangers for a fee that are matched through other channels besides the carpooling operators. And usually, this is taken either through public feedback or if LTA conducts enforcement operations that are targeted at these illegal carpooling activities. When we conduct operations, we need to get evidence that these completed trips are actually between strangers and are for a fee through a channel that is not through the carpooling operators, before we take action.",2,9,014-001-095-087-003-009,37
2023-02-27,Distinction between Social and Illegal Carpooling,014-001-095-087-003,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,LTA will exercise reasonableness and will not intervene if they are purely social carpooling arrangements.,3,10,014-001-095-087-003-010,38
2023-02-27,Distinction between Social and Illegal Carpooling,014-001-095-087-003,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"Basically, if the driver provides trips through these chatgroups and has a valid vocational licence and drives a public service vehicle, then, that is not illegal and it is allowed. It is only not allowed if the driver does not have a valid vocational licence and does not drive a private hire car (PHC). Then, that would be illegal.",4,11,014-001-095-087-003-011,39

2023-02-27,Balance in MediSave Amounts Following Death of CPF Account Holders,014-001-095-087-007,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer),"  I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the reply. I note that the data given is only for those above 85 years old. Because there is quite a number who are below 85 at the point of death, the figures are not given. But, otherwise, I think the main crux is that we do hear, anecdotally, many MediSave account holders who pass on with larger or quite significant amounts in their MediSave accounts. And therefore, an appeal for the Ministry of Health (MOH) to consider whether we can allow greater MediSave deductions, especially those with chronic illnesses, rare diseases, as well as for exigencies, where they need to tap on the MediSave to pay, to prolong their life and make sure that they are adequately treated.",1,5,014-001-095-087-007-005,65

And insofar as those who are 65 years old and above, the amount left in their MediSave is also not that high.

2023-02-27,Correlation between Tightening of Foreign Worker Quotas and Hiring of Singaporeans at Higher Pay,014-001-095-087-008,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"One key finding of our internal studies on foreign workforce policies is that tightening access to lower-skilled foreign workers is more likely to have a positive impact on local employment outcomes, compared to tightening access to higher-skilled foreign workers. This is because businesses will then be able to substitute lower-skilled but cheaper foreign workers with locals, and therefore, improve their production processes accordingly. This has informed our approach of remaining open to high-quality, foreign professionals, while maintaining a disciplined stance in regulating the number of work permit holders through quotas and also levies.",3,4,014-001-095-087-008-004,74

Just two clarifications or supplementary questions. Firstly, just to make sure that I have the right understanding. The Minister was saying that, based on the impact studies that have been conducted in the past, for lower-skilled workers, when the supply of foreign manpower, when that tap is tightened, that tends to lead to better employment outcomes for Singaporeans at the lower end of the wage scale – I just wanted to clarify that. Because that is an interesting finding.",1,8,014-001-095-087-008-008,78
2023-02-27,Correlation between Tightening of Foreign Worker Quotas and Hiring of Singaporeans at Higher Pay,014-001-095-087-008,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"For the other observation that the Minister made about the studies that for more highly-skilled foreign professionals, that that correlation does not really apply so much as it does to the lower-skilled workers. Would the right conclusion to draw from that, be that we, in Singapore, are not producing enough highly-skilled or qualified professionals to fill the job vacancies that the economy is creating?",2,9,014-001-095-087-008-009,79
2023-02-27,Correlation between Tightening of Foreign Worker Quotas and Hiring of Singaporeans at Higher Pay,014-001-095-087-008,Dr Tan See Leng,"  I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. The first point, in terms of the studies' findings for low-skilled workers, it is up to a certain point. The studies have shown that, if you tighten at the lower-skilled part, the net result is that we do get substitution and our locals can take on these jobs, but at slightly higher levels. To a point.",1,10,014-001-095-087-008-010,80

We are already doing significantly more to improve their prospects, in terms of moving them, in terms of investing in their training, and in upskilling and upgrading. But again, because of the fact that there are all these accelerating changes, economies and industries are evolving very rapidly, and coupled with that, significant disruptions that are happening.",3,12,014-001-095-087-008-012,82

After a two-year hiatus, the SLD resumed last year in a physical format. SLD22 was a successful event that was well-attended by 37 ministerial-level delegates, including from both the United States and China. The SLD remains the premier defence and security conference in Asia and provides a venue to affirm mutually beneficial principles and to allow for dialogue, if not build trust.

Based on our estimates, the automated system will save employers, NSmen, MINDEF and MHA more than 260,000 man-hours of processing effort every year. Apart from saving time, the automation has also allowed us to make payment much faster. Since September, 90% of claims have been paid within 10 days from the start of in-camp training (ICT).

This means that if the data from CPF Board or IRAS indicates that an NSman earns less than $1,600 per month, MINDEF will top up his NS Pay to $1,600 per month, prorated according to the duration of the ORNS activity. As an example, if an NSman attends a 12-day ICT, on a prorated basis of a base pay of $1,600, he would be paid at least $600.",21,144,014-001-095-087-012-144,253

2023-02-27,Committee of Supply – Head N (Ministry of Foreign Affairs),014-001-095-087-013,The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan),"First, foreign policy begins at home. I think the Leader of Opposition also agrees with that. If we are not united and successful as a thriving, vital city-state in the heart of Southeast Asia, we will quickly become irrelevant to the world. I am also gratified that if you listen to all the speeches by the PAP Members of Parliament, the Opposition and the Nominated Members of Parliament, in fact, if you all exchanged your speeches, it would not have been noticeable.

Both sides need to establish guardrails, as hardened, negative views against the ""other side"" increasingly become structural features of geopolitical discourse in both the US and China. For example, there is a growing body of opinion within China that the US is a superpower in terminal decline, which is determined to contain China's rise at all costs. In the US, there has also been a deep shift in attitudes towards China. The US believes that China ""is the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to advance that objective"".

The US has identified computing-related technologies, biotech and clean tech as force multipliers throughout the technological ecosystem and emphasised leadership in each of these arenas as a national security imperative. Consequently, the US has decided it needs to maintain as large a lead as possible over China in these fields.

Singapore will not escape such spill-over consequences. Our open economy is highly dependent on doing business with the entire world and we have benefitted greatly from being a vital node in globalised supply chains. The US is the largest foreign investor in Singapore and our top trading partner for services. But we are also one of the largest investors in China, which is our top trading partner in goods. If the US and China get along, then Singapore will be ideally positioned to prosper.

Under the FIR Agreement, Indonesia will delegate to Singapore the provision of air navigation services in portions of the airspace which are within the realigned Jakarta FIR which are nearest to Singapore. This will ensure that the present and future air traffic to Changi Airport and nearby Indonesian airports continue to be managed safely and efficiently. The DCA will enhance cooperation and interaction between our two military forces. It will provide clarity for the SAF's training in Indonesian archipelagic and territorial waters and airspace, on a basis that fully respects Indonesia's sovereignty over its territory, while preserving Singapore's rights under UNCLOS. Finally, the ET will strengthen cooperation between our law enforcement agencies to combat crime and to complement our existing cooperation with Indonesia.

Singapore has always advocated engaging major players so that they all have a stake in the peace, stability and development of our region, and can create a stable balance of power in the Asia Pacific. This provides small countries like Singapore more room for manoeuvre than if there was only a single power dominating our region. Naturally, we do not want the major powers to make Asia their battleground or conduct proxy wars here.

Our external partners also want to do more with ASEAN. Last year ASEAN upgraded its relations with the US and India to Comprehensive Strategic Partnerships, after doing the same with China and Australia the year before.

Mr Gerald Giam asked if we are looking at alternative options for decision making, when consensus is difficult or hindered. The need for consensus is in fact, a design feature, it is not a bug, precisely because of the great diversity within ASEAN. No other regional association has the level of diversity that ASEAN represents.

Singapore has been steadfast in our support for a negotiated two-state solution that allows both Israelis and Palestinians to live side-by-side in peace and security, in accordance with the relevant UNSC resolutions. As a friend of both sides, we continue to urge both Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) to return to direct negotiations. A two-state solution requires both sides to have the political will to negotiate with each other in good faith and make the necessary concessions. The recent decision by Israeli government to retroactively legitimise nine outposts in the West Bank is deeply worrying. Such unilateral moves will only further heighten tensions and undermine any prospect for peace. We urge all parties to avoid taking further unilateral actions. The status quo at the Temple Mount/Haram Al Sharif should be maintained.

There for 10 days, they operated in very difficult conditions. They had to contend with freezing temperatures, the ever-present threat of further collapse of buildings and the calamitous security situation.

It seems to me, by reference to the increasing number of recent cases of young persons being self-radicalised through access to harmful online content, that there is a case to take a relook at the legislative levers to ensure that our Home Team officers, particularly the Internal Security Department (ISD) have the tools to prevent the proliferation of such cases. Otherwise, the impact on Singapore can be significant and severe.",18,19,014-001-095-087-014-019,704

I commend the Singapore Prison Services (SPS) for spearheading efforts with its stakeholders to keep the recividism rate amongst desisters relatively low and stable. The five-year recividism rate of 39.9%, which I believe is being released for the first time this year, is an encouraging statistic even though there is a slight increase in the two-year recividism rate by 0.4% to 20.4%.",20,21,014-001-095-087-014-021,706

This was something I pushed for in this House when I suggested that the Jobs Growth Incentive for ex-offenders to help them during the COVID-19 pandemic be turned into a permanent scheme.,21,22,014-001-095-087-014-022,707

2023-02-27,Committee of Supply – Head P (Ministry of Home Affairs),014-001-095-087-014,Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok),"To effect permanent changes, we have to start with the individual and work with their families too. This will not be easy but has to be done. I understand that SPS has, over the years, built a substantial number of volunteers who are roped in to help with reintegration support for prison inmates and desisters. I believe that there is a case for SPS and its volunteers to partner the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), Ministry of National Development (MND) and other Government agencies to co-create bespoke plans for each desister that has a series of incentives and disincentives during the supervision period of desisters. The purpose is to motivate desisters to be responsible family members and encourage reconciliation within their families. I truly believe that once our desisters are accepted back and reconciled with their families, the sky will be the limit for them.",24,25,014-001-095-087-014-025,710

They have talent, knowledge and experience which Singapore can benefit from. We need to get behind them and signal to them that we will support them so long as they keep on the path of rehabilitation and reintegration. Early last year, I suggested in this House that our desisters be given an opportunity to perform at our National Day Parade. Having seen them perform, I know that they will be a hit amongst Singaporeans. I understood that my suggestion was made too late for National Day Parade (NDP) 2022.

Both the two-year recidivism rate at 26.1% and the five-year recidivism rate at 45.2%, were up.

I believe it would be helpful, so I would advocate for it. And I used the peg of the findings of the latest Census report which spoke of English and how commonly it is spoken in Singapore, comparing 2020 to 2010 and it is much more widely spoken today. So, the peg that I am coming in from is its utility as a tool to improve integration between Singaporeans and new citizens.",1,319,014-001-095-087-014-319,1004

Within a span of three weeks, I had two separate families come and see me. One had lost $280,000 and one having lost $80,000.

I thank Minister Mrs Josephine Teo for her explanation on how we are using drones and unmanned surveillance equipment. My humble suggestion is that that not substitute the need for good human ground judgement in order to know how to prevent crime and also disperse crowds.

Indeed, we have a ""kill switch"" which I mentioned in my main reply. This emergency self-service ""kill switch"" allows customers to suspend their accounts quickly, if compromised. But this is their own account. As noted by Mr Christopher de Souza, what happens often is that the original sum of monies from the bank account, customer's account, gets dismantled, dispersed and then, goes through the banking system into various other bank accounts not owned by them. So, while the bank account, the original bank account holder, the victim has activated the ""kill switch"" for his or her own account, it has not stopped the monies from being transferred to other accounts.",1,338,014-001-095-087-014-338,1023

And guess how many accounts the original sum of monies went through? Eighty-nine bank accounts. That was how quickly bank accounts were set up and the monies is dispersed through the banking system. And that is why it is important that we work with the various retail banks to have the retail banks co-located together so that we can share information quickly and for the banks to quickly trace the monies and close off those bank accounts and stop the monies from moving through the banking system and then, out of Singapore, whereby it is then out of our jurisdiction.",3,340,014-001-095-087-014-340,1025

One of the many challenges facing Singapore is that we are a small country of about 730 square kilometres in size. There is competing demand for the limited land to be used for residential, industrial, commercial, roads and parks. Given the limited land resources in Singapore, it is important that the State maximise the best use of its available resources. I had previously suggested that we consider using the car park space at sports stadiums to be used for parking by heavy commercial vehicles at night when the stadium is not used.

The current retirement age of 65 years was introduced way back in 1969, more than half a century ago, when the life expectancy in Singapore was 67.6 years.

Minister, last November, the Chief Justice revealed in a speech he made at the Supreme Court that when a Judge approached 65 years of age, he would ordinarily be offered an extension to continue in office till the age of 68. So, my question is, if this is ordinarily being offered to Judges upon reaching 65, why not simply extend the retirement age to 70, since ""ordinarily"", there will be an extension of the term of office?",1,27,014-001-095-087-016-027,1469
2023-02-27,Committee of Supply – Head E (Judicature),014-001-095-087-016,Ms Sylvia Lim,"The second clarification is that he mentioned that some Judges might want to leave the Court at 65, they may have other plans and so on.

But that is not the same as mandating that. So, ordinarily offered does not mean that in all these cases, it is accepted. There is still an option for a Judge to take one or more of the routes that I have indicated, such as being appointed as a Senior Judge instead, or perhaps taking on a case, depending on his or her preference on the caseload schedule.",2,30,014-001-095-087-016-030,1472

In such cases, operators are required to verify drivers’ licences and enforce a maximum of two carpool journeys a day at cost recovery. Details of booked trips are also recorded by operators, which can be used to aid investigations in the event of an incident or a dispute. Illegal carpooling trips matched through other platforms such as Telegram chat groups do not have such safeguards.

Firstly, as I have mentioned earlier, to ensure commuter safety, we have limited the matching of carpooling services with strangers to be done only via licensed carpooling operators or the smaller operators, that means business entities that are carpooling operators, because these operators maintain records of the drivers as well as the trips booked, in case of a dispute or an incident.

LTA will only take enforcement actions against drivers who are found to have completed these carpooling trips with strangers for a fee that are matched through other channels besides the carpooling operators. And usually, this is taken either through public feedback or if LTA conducts enforcement operations that are targeted at these illegal carpooling activities. When we conduct operations, we need to get evidence that these completed trips are actually between strangers and are for a fee through a channel that is not through the carpooling operators, before we take action.",2,9,014-001-095-087-003-009,1566

And insofar as those who are 65 years old and above, the amount left in their MediSave is also not that high. So, although we do see some with large amounts left, in general, we believe a larger number do not have excessively high amounts, of more than $10,000.

2023-02-27,Correlation between Tightening of Foreign Worker Quotas and Hiring of Singaporeans at Higher Pay,014-001-095-087-008,The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng),"One key finding of our internal studies on foreign workforce policies is that tightening access to lower-skilled foreign workers is more likely to have a positive impact on local employment outcomes, compared to tightening access to higher-skilled foreign workers. This is because businesses will then be able to substitute lower-skilled but cheaper foreign workers with locals, and therefore, improve their production processes accordingly. This has informed our approach of remaining open to high-quality, foreign professionals, while maintaining a disciplined stance in regulating the number of work permit holders through quotas and also levies.",3,4,014-001-095-087-008-004,1603

Just two clarifications or supplementary questions. Firstly, just to make sure that I have the right understanding. The Minister was saying that, based on the impact studies that have been conducted in the past, for lower-skilled workers, when the supply of foreign manpower, when that tap is tightened, that tends to lead to better employment outcomes for Singaporeans at the lower end of the wage scale – I just wanted to clarify that. Because that is an interesting finding.",1,8,014-001-095-087-008-008,1607

Would the right conclusion to draw from that, be that we, in Singapore, are not producing enough highly-skilled or qualified professionals to fill the job vacancies that the economy is creating?",2,9,014-001-095-087-008-009,1608
2023-02-27,Correlation between Tightening of Foreign Worker Quotas and Hiring of Singaporeans at Higher Pay,014-001-095-087-008,Dr Tan See Leng,"  I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. The first point, in terms of the studies' findings for low-skilled workers, it is up to a certain point. The studies have shown that, if you tighten at the lower-skilled part, the net result is that we do get substitution and our locals can take on these jobs, but at slightly higher levels.

We are already doing significantly more to improve their prospects, in terms of moving them, in terms of investing in their training, and in upskilling and upgrading. But again, because of the fact that there are all these accelerating changes, economies and industries are evolving very rapidly, and coupled with that, significant disruptions that are happening.",3,12,014-001-095-087-008-012,1611

2023-02-27,Committee of Supply – Head J (Ministry of Defence),014-001-095-087-012,Mr Heng Chee How,"Given low fertility rates and shrinking cohort sizes, the SAF needs to optimise the contributions of every soldier – in two ways. The first concerns medical fitness and job requirements. To complement our existing medical screening process, we introduced functional assessments for pre-enlistees with selected orthopaedic conditions. Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked for an update on this.",3,126,014-001-095-087-012-126,1764
2023-02-27,Committee of Supply – Head J (Ministry of Defence),014-001-095-087-012,Mr Heng Chee How,"Under this functional assessment, we assess the pre-enlistee's ability to do physical tasks such as running, jumping and carrying heavy loads. This approach allows us to accurately match more servicemen to operational roles as compared to the traditional approach of matching servicemen based only on their medical diagnosis.",4,127,014-001-095-087-012-127,1765
2023-02-27,Committee of Supply – Head J (Ministry of Defence),014-001-095-087-012,Mr Heng Chee How,"To date, 100 pre-enlistees with certain orthopaedic conditions have undergone such functional assessments and 75 have been found to be fit to be deployed to a wider range of operational roles than before. At the same time, we are leveraging technology to redesign jobs. Similarly, this enables more servicemen to be deployed into operational roles.",5,128,014-001-095-087-012-128,1766
2023-02-27,Committee of Supply – Head J (Ministry of Defence),014-001-095-087-012,Mr Heng Chee How,"Since 2021, the SAF has redesigned 1,300 jobs in vocations such as Medics, Infantry Carrier Vehicle Operators and Transport Operators, opening them up to more servicemen. The SAF is on track to do the same for another 500 jobs by the middle of this year and that will bring it from 1,300, to 1,800 jobs.",6,129,014-001-095-087-012-129,1767
2023-02-27,Committee of Supply – Head J (Ministry of Defence),014-001-095-087-012,Mr Heng Chee How,"The second way is to maximise contributions that concern knowledge and skills. To keep up with the changing nature of conflict and emerging threats, the SAF needs to grow and tap the skills of our national servicemen.

2023-02-27,Committee of Supply – Head J (Ministry of Defence),014-001-095-087-012,Mr Heng Chee How,This brings me to the second thrust of the NSRC's recommendations – that of improving the NS experience.,17,140,014-001-095-087-012-140,1778
2023-02-27,Committee of Supply – Head J (Ministry of Defence),014-001-095-087-012,Mr Heng Chee How,"A major administrative burden for employers and NSmen had been the filing of Make-Up Pay claims for In-Camp Training (ICT). In the past, this was done manually. Entries were therefore sometimes incomplete and payment delays happened.",18,141,014-001-095-087-012-141,1779
2023-02-27,Committee of Supply – Head J (Ministry of Defence),014-001-095-087-012,Mr Heng Chee How,"In September last year, we introduced an automated system that draws income-related information from CPF Board and IRAS to calculate Make-Up Pay amounts. If they so wish, employers and NSmen can review the computed amounts and file for adjustments. Otherwise, the amounts will be paid out automatically and there is no action needed on their part.",19,142,014-001-095-087-012-142,1780
2023-02-27,Committee of Supply – Head J (Ministry of Defence),014-001-095-087-012,Mr Heng Chee How,"As a result, we have had very positive feedback. The claim amounts derived from CPF Board and IRAS data have proven to be up to date and accurate. Since September, 92% of claims have been processed automatically. Based on our estimates, the automated system will save employers, NSmen, MINDEF and MHA more than 260,000 man-hours of processing effort every year. Apart from saving time, the automation has also allowed us to make payment much faster. Since September, 90% of claims have been paid within 10 days from the start of in-camp training (ICT). Practically, the payment is processed while people may still be undergoing their period of ICT.",20,143,014-001-095-087-012-143,1781
2023-02-27,Committee of Supply – Head J (Ministry of Defence),014-001-095-087-012,Mr Heng Chee How,"Alongside this automated system, we also introduced a base NS pay of $1,600 per month whenever NSmen attend ICT or other operationally-ready NS (ORNS) activities. This means that if the data from CPF Board or IRAS indicates that an NSman earns less than $1,600 per month, MINDEF will top up his NS Pay to $1,600 per month, prorated according to the duration of the ORNS activity. As an example, if an NSman attends a 12-day ICT, on a prorated basis of a base pay of $1,600, he would be paid at least $600.",21,144,014-001-095-087-012-144,1782
2023-02-27,Committee of Supply – Head J (Ministry of Defence),014-001-095-087-012,Mr Heng Chee How,This provides additional support to NSmen who are students or who are not employed or whose income from informal jobs may not be fully captured in CPF or IRAS data. We hope that this gives NSmen from lower-income segments greater financial security when they attend ORNS activities.,22,145,014-001-095-087-012-145,1783
2023-02-27,Committee of Supply – Head J (Ministry of Defence),014-001-095-087-012,Mr Heng Chee How,"On this, I just want to reiterate the point that MINDEF is fully committed to the well-being and welfare of our national servicemen, both NSFs and NSmen. Through so many examples that we have given, the public can be confident that we will regularly update such benefits in order to take good care of our servicemen.",23,146,014-001-095-087-012-146,1784
2023-02-27,Committee of Supply – Head J (Ministry of Defence),014-001-095-087-012,Mr Heng Chee How,Our efforts to digitalise NS transactions and touchpoints go beyond Make-Up Pay claims.,24,147,014-001-095-087-012-147,1785

2023-02-27,Committee of Supply – Head J (Ministry of Defence),014-001-095-087-012,Mr Heng Chee How,"With the change, national servicemen are now able to receive, carry and redeem their credits via their mobile devices. The credits can be used with any business that accepts payment by NETS or PayNow QR. Some businesses also offer our servicemen discounts for the use of the credits as a show of support for National Service. When they do so, this has effectively further raised the dollar value of the benefits.",26,149,014-001-095-087-012-149,1787
2023-02-27,Committee of Supply – Head J (Ministry of Defence),014-001-095-087-012,Mr Heng Chee How,"As part of the NS55 Recognition Package, $100 worth of credits were distributed electronically in July last year to more than a million national servicemen past and present.

2023-02-27,Committee of Supply – Head J (Ministry of Defence),014-001-095-087-012,Mr Heng Chee How,"Over the past seven months, 76% of national servicemen have started using or have already used their credits fully. This is a relevant piece of data because it shows that when it is made available to be used electronically, it makes it much more convenient and it speeds up the utilisation and the enjoyment of the benefit. In comparison, it took 18 months to achieve the same use for physical vouchers when we did that for NS50. I encourage all national servicemen to fully utilise your credits.",28,151,014-001-095-087-012-151,1789
2023-02-27,Committee of Supply – Head J (Ministry of Defence),014-001-095-087-012,Mr Heng Chee How,Ms Poh Li San asked about the use of the OneNS platform to improve the NS experience. The OneNS platform is a consolidation of NS-related services and transactions into a single mobile app. We rolled out the first phase of OneNS to selected ICT units. NSmen in these units can register their attendance at ICT easily with the geo-location function on the app. This has allowed the units concerned to start the proper ICT programme earlier. OneNS will be extended to more units in the coming months.,29,152,014-001-095-087-012-152,1790

In fact, we can already look forward to the opening of the new SAFRA clubhouse in Choa Chu Kang in May this year. That will bring an exciting host of amenities, especially to the 90,000 NSmen who reside in the northwest. I think many of us might have seen the exciting photos of my colleague, Senior Minister of State Zaqy's recent hard-hat tour of the upcoming facilities. So, look out for that.",34,157,014-001-095-087-012-157,1795

In January, we doubled the coverage for the Group Term Life and Group Personal Accident insurance, up from $150,000 to $300,000. We have also extended the coverage to conditions such as long-term hearing damage and decompression sickness.

From April this year onwards, NSmen will only need to apply for an Exit Permit when they leave Singapore for 12 months or more, up from the current six months or more.

Beneath the cordial and friendly nature of Singaporeans, the large number of foreigners, our ethnic and racial make-up and the number of new citizens in our economy can easily be exploited as a fault line.

In the US, there has also been a deep shift in attitudes towards China.

I commend the Singapore Prison Services (SPS) for spearheading efforts with its stakeholders to keep the recividism rate amongst desisters relatively low and stable.

This will not be easy but has to be done. I understand that SPS has, over the years, built a substantial number of volunteers who are roped in to help with reintegration support for prison inmates and desisters. I believe that there is a case for SPS and its volunteers to partner the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), Ministry of National Development (MND) and other Government agencies to co-create bespoke plans for each desister that has a series of incentives and disincentives during the supervision period of desisters.

Early last year, I suggested in this House that our desisters be given an opportunity to perform at our National Day Parade.

Both the two-year recidivism rate at 26.1% and the five-year recidivism rate at 45.2%, were up. Separately, the consistently higher five-year rates point to the fact that over the longer term, the chances of re-offending are higher.

Indeed, we have a ""kill switch"" which I mentioned in my main reply. This emergency self-service ""kill switch"" allows customers to suspend their accounts quickly, if compromised. But this is their own account. As noted by Mr Christopher de Souza, what happens often is that the original sum of monies from the bank account, customer's account, gets dismantled, dispersed and then, goes through the banking system into various other bank accounts not owned by them. So, while the bank account, the original bank account holder, the victim has activated the ""kill switch"" for his or her own account, it has not stopped the monies from being transferred to other accounts.",1,338,014-001-095-087-014-338,2552

And guess how many accounts the original sum of monies went through? Eighty-nine bank accounts. That was how quickly bank accounts were set up and the monies is dispersed through the banking system. And that is why it is important that we work with the various retail banks to have the retail banks co-located together so that we can share information quickly and for the banks to quickly trace the monies and close off those bank accounts and stop the monies from moving through the banking system and then, out of Singapore, whereby it is then out of our jurisdiction.",3,340,014-001-095-087-014-340,2554

One of the many challenges facing Singapore is that we are a small country of about 730 square kilometres in size. There is competing demand for the limited land to be used for residential, industrial, commercial, roads and parks. Given the limited land resources in Singapore, it is important that the State maximise the best use of its available resources. I had previously suggested that we consider using the car park space at sports stadiums to be used for parking by heavy commercial vehicles at night when the stadium is not used. This could free up some space for heavy vehicles or commerical vehicles to park.",1,114,014-001-095-087-015-114,2704

The suggestion to move the age when tenure ends from 65 to 70 years is actually a very modest one, if one looks at how life expectancy in Singapore has changed over the decades. The current retirement age of 65 years was introduced way back in 1969, more than half a century ago, when the life expectancy in Singapore was 67.6 years. Just consider that – in 1969, a Judge retiring at 65 years then, statistically had just a few more years to live.

Minister, last November, the Chief Justice revealed in a speech he made at the Supreme Court that when a Judge approached 65 years of age, he would ordinarily be offered an extension to continue in office till the age of 68. So, my question is, if this is ordinarily being offered to Judges upon reaching 65, why not simply extend the retirement age to 70, since ""ordinarily"", there will be an extension of the term of office?",1,27,014-001-095-087-016-027,2998
2023-02-27,Committee of Supply – Head E (Judicature),014-001-095-087-016,Ms Sylvia Lim,"The second clarification is that he mentioned that some Judges might want to leave the Court at 65, they may have other plans and so on.

But that is not the same as mandating that. So, ordinarily offered does not mean that in all these cases, it is accepted. There is still an option for a Judge to take one or more of the routes that I have indicated, such as being appointed as a Senior Judge instead, or perhaps taking on a case, depending on his or her preference on the caseload schedule.",2,30,014-001-095-087-016-030,3001
