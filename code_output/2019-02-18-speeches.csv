2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mr Lim Biow Chuan,asked the Minister for Manpower whether the CPF Board will (i) amend its policy to allow automatic withdrawal of the CPF payout when a member reaches 65 years of age and (ii) allow members who wish to withdraw their CPF funds later than age 65 to then indicate their choice in an opt-out form.,1,1,013-002-094-092-001-001,1

2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mr Chong Kee Hiong,asked the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will consider making the age of 65 the default option for CPF monthly payouts while providing incentives for CPF members who opt for the payouts to be deferred.,1,7,013-002-094-092-001-007,7

2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,The first question is whether the CPF Payout Eligibility Age has been shifted from 65 to 70. The answer is no.,2,13,013-002-094-092-001-013,13

2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,,"This is in fact a long-standing practice, and there has been no change. Members can instruct CPF Board when to start their retirement payouts at any time after they reach their PEA. Members are in the best position to decide based on their individual circumstances. It is also the same approach as in many other countries.",3,17,013-002-094-092-001-017,17
2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,,There is no advantage for CPF Board or Government to want members to defer their payouts beyond 65. Those who defer their payouts in fact enjoy the higher interest paid on their CPF monies.,4,18,013-002-094-092-001-018,18

2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,,"About six months before their PEA, RSS members will receive a letter from CPF Board informing them that they can start their payouts any time from PEA. The form to start payouts is attached. Members only need to fill in basic information – their name, NRIC, contact details and bank account details. This gets sent back to the Board. Alternatively, members can apply online through the CPF website or come to a CPF Service Centre. Members who do not instruct CPF Board to start their payouts are reminded through their Yearly Statement of Account.",2,20,013-002-094-092-001-020,20
2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,,"The third question is why the payouts start automatically at age 70. In the past, some RSS members had their savings intact in their CPF accounts until they passed away. They never touched it at all. This is unsatisfactory. We therefore introduced a Latest Payout Start Age of 70 for members turning 70 from 2018.",3,21,013-002-094-092-001-021,21

But I must again emphasise, if a member wants to start his payout before 70, he can do so any time from his PEA; he does not need to wait till 70. In other words, the Latest Payout Start Age is not the same thing as the PEA. It is a way to ensure members get to enjoy the benefit of their CPF savings by 70 at the latest.",4,22,013-002-094-092-001-022,22

2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,,"There are in fact tangible benefits to members when they start their payouts later. Members earn more interest and enjoy enhanced payouts. With every year that they defer their payouts, their CPF savings will earn risk-free interest of up to 6% a year, which is well above the interest rates they would get in the market. This 6% includes the extra interest of 1% for the first $60,000 and additional extra interest of 1% for the first $30,000. For members on CPF LIFE, for every year deferred, the payouts go up by up to 7%. For five years of deferral, that is up to 35% more.",2,25,013-002-094-092-001-025,25

They joined CPF LIFE before July 2015. Back then, there was no flexibility to defer CPF LIFE payouts and the policy letter has already stated that the payouts would start from their PEA. For such members, CPF Board will indeed start payouts at PEA, unless otherwise instructed. In fact, by the end of 2018, about 35,000 of such members had already started to receive their payouts upon reaching their PEA, which is what they expected.",13,36,013-002-094-092-001-036,36

2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),  I thank the Minister for clarifying that the Payout Eligibility Age has not shifted from age 65 to 70. I think this is very important and very re-assuring for CPF members. But I am concerned that about 60% of CPF members do not come forward to withdraw their CPF when they reach 65 years old. The Minister said that about half of CPF members do not come forward to withdraw their CPF even when they have reached 70 years of age.,1,43,013-002-094-092-001-043,43
2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"This is an area of concern because this is not a small number of people. Could it be that a large number of these CPF members may not do anything about it because they do not know the procedure? Or could it be that they have forgotten about the need to apply to withdraw their CPF savings? It is a big number. If we are saying just a small percentage, then I can understand that, well, perhaps they do not read their mail or that they forgot about it. But it is quite a large number and I am concerned.",2,44,013-002-094-092-001-044,44
2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"The Minister had said that CPF starts their payout automatically for a member when the member reaches 70 years of age. If CPF Board can do so at age 70, why not make the payout automatic at the age of 65? Just credit their account automatically, unless the member opt and chooses to fill in an application to say that they do not want to do so, they do not want to withdraw. I think the point is that we need to assure every member that CPF Board will be able to honour any request to withdraw their CPF savings when these are due for payment. And really, this is about preserving the good faith and trust in CPF Board.",3,45,013-002-094-092-001-045,45
2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten),"So, I urge the Minister to try to dispel any doubts that CPF Board is deliberately withholding members' CPF monies, even though they had reached the Payout Eligibility Age. I just wanted to add that I appreciate the benefit of higher interest rates. In fact, when I reached 65, I made a conscious decision to leave my monies with CPF Board, simply because the interest paid on the CPF savings is much better and as the Government has re-assured us repeatedly, it is risk-free. So, thank you, Minister.",4,46,013-002-094-092-001-046,46
2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,"  Mr Speaker, the Member Mr Lim has asked a very important question. The points he has raised are not trivial at all. I must share with Members that I gave serious thought to the possibility of shifting the automatic start date to 65. But there are several concerns and I should share them with you.",1,47,013-002-094-092-001-047,47
2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,There may be a group of members who are aware of the benefits of payout deferral. But they forget to come forward to instruct CPF Board to defer their payouts. There will be such individuals. Mr Lim may become one of them.,2,48,013-002-094-092-001-048,48
2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Another group may not be aware but actually they do not need the payouts just yet, even after they have reached their Payout Eligibility Age. It is entirely possible that this group will grow over time. After all, between the age of 65 and 69 today, our employment rate is about 40%. With good health, we can expect more people to want to work longer. If, indeed, they are still receiving incomes, they may find that the CPF payout is somewhat unnecessary at that point in time.",3,49,013-002-094-092-001-049,49

2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Also, there is another concern that weighs heavily. I am quite wary of making yet another sudden change. We have, for years, told CPF members that their payouts start when they instruct CPF Board – this has been the longstanding instruction. Tomorrow, if we decide otherwise, how can we be sure everyone gets the message? That is the central lesson we have learnt. Every time there is a change, it actually takes a long while for people to get used to it. Each time we make another change – we say that people on the previous system get to keep that previous approach, and from then onwards, this group has a different treatment. Those kind of changes actually risk confusing people even more.",5,51,013-002-094-092-001-051,51
2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,"On balance, I suggest that we focus on improving the communications for the policy as it currently stands. With the benefit of knowledge, CPF members can still start their retirement payouts any time after 65.

2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah),"  I am glad that the Minister said that CPF will review the letter that is sent to members when the members reach age 65. I hope that the CPF can review this particular statement that is made in the letter, ""No action is required if you wish to start your payout at age of 70"". This line is in bold; it is repeated twice. This is the only line that is in bold. Perhaps that is the reason why people are confused and are thinking if there is a shift in the payout age.",1,54,013-002-094-092-001-054,54

2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,"  Mr Speaker, I wholeheartedly support what Mr Liang has suggested. We definitely can improve the way we communicate with CPF members. Today, CPF Board engages with members through a variety of means. Letters are just one of them. CPF Board administers quite a wide range of Government schemes – MediShield Life, MediSave disbursements, Silver Support, Workfare Income Supplement. If you put together all the letters that CPF Board sends out, there are about 220 types. Obviously, some of them have the risk of not being entirely clear. We will definitely put effort into improving them.",1,56,013-002-094-092-001-056,56

There are five CPF Service Centres islandwide. Each of these CPF Service Centres is staffed by officers who are conversant in all the major languages, especially, of course, our four official languages. Even if a member was unable to understand the letter that has been sent to them, we hope, by the very fact that they saw the CPF logo, that they will know that they can always approach the Service Centre. The staff will be happy to take them through in a language they are comfortable with. That is something we will make as a commitment.",2,57,013-002-094-092-001-057,57

At the age of 55, the invitation is extended to every member. From this year onwards, once they reach their Payout Eligibility Age, which is 65, we will equally invite the member to come again, so that CPF Board can provide personalised guidance, face-to-face.

Did MOM reach out to those people who did not activate their payout at PEA, or even beyond 70, to find out why? Perhaps do a survey, to this group of people, since we know who they are?",1,59,013-002-094-092-001-059,59
2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,"  There are two parts to that question. Do we reach out to them? The answer is yes, because everyone gets the Yearly Statement of Account. CPF records will show whether the member has reached the PEA but has not activated payouts, in which case CPF Board will remind the individual that ""You have reached the PEA. You are eligible to start your payouts. Here is the form, activate it any time you want"".",1,60,013-002-094-092-001-060,60
2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The second part of it is, do we ask them why they have not started or activated their payouts? Here is where, I think, we have to be a little bit careful. People have a right to their privacy. CPF Board must be quite mindful that not everyone wants to tell the Board the reasons for their actions. Therefore, if we want to establish, amongst those who have not started their payouts, who actually is aware and made a conscious decision not to start it, who is not aware and did not come forward to instruct the Board, this would be quite a major exercise. We think there is some value in doing so but we will have to find a way that the member does not feel very intruded upon.",2,61,013-002-094-092-001-061,61

2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"First, I think some of the public unhappiness is, perhaps, due to the gap between the retirement age at 62 and the Payout Eligibility Age at 65. Some are concerned that they have difficulty making ends meet between retirement and the start of the payouts. Would the Ministry consider aligning the retirement age with the PEA in the future, to allow for a seamless transition between work income and CPF income?",2,63,013-002-094-092-001-063,63
2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"Second, the default ""out"" at the moment, I think it is a good move because it improves retirement adequacy. But, at the same time, members may want assurance, as other House Members have said, of knowing that their payouts will commence and that the mechanism for paying out is sound. Could we consider starting with, perhaps, a lower payout at first at the PEA and then scaling up to the full payout at 70, or on application of the member?",3,64,013-002-094-092-001-064,64
2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member),"The last question is  what is known right now about the use of payouts at the earlier PEAs, that is, are the payouts used for expenses or do they sit largely in zero percent or close to zero percent savings accounts?

2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,"In Singapore, together with Japan, besides the retirement age, there is actually the re-employment age. We are, to the best of our knowledge, the only two countries in the world that have the provision for re-employment. In the Singapore context, the re-employment age, when it was first implemented, was to age 65; this was in 2012. Then, in July 2017, we raised the re-employment age to 67. So, in fact, Singaporeans have the assurance of employment beyond the retirement age of 62, all the way up to 67. In any case, both the retirement age and the re-employment age are being reviewed. A tripartite workgroup was set up last year and is making good progress. I hope to be able to update Members during the COS debate.",2,67,013-002-094-092-001-067,67
2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Let me turn to the second question. I believe the Member had suggested, if you are concerned about starting the payouts at 65, why not start with a smaller payout. I think it can be looked into, but I suppose the question the members will also have is  how do you decide what is a small payout? If you are going to start with a small payout, why not just start with the whole payout?",3,68,013-002-094-092-001-068,68
2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The third, I am very glad that the Member asked this question. What is the typical use of the payout? We do not have very clear indications about what happens to the payouts once they start being streamed out on a monthly basis. There is good reason to also not be too precise about the use of those monthly payouts because they will be co-mingled with contributions from other family members, perhaps, personal savings. It will be very hard to tease apart what part of that money can be attributed to CPF payouts, what part attributed to children's allowances.",4,69,013-002-094-092-001-069,69
2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,"But what people do with their withdrawals at age 55 is instructive. Our survey suggests that slightly over half of the members, after taking the withdrawals from their CPF accounts at the age of 55, just put it in a bank account, earning much poorer interest rates. That actually is a very useful reminder that people are not always so savvy about what is the best deal that they can get on their savings. There is some merit to the current practice of automatically deferring it for them, because they get to earn a much better interest rate. When they want to start their payouts, it is still available to them anytime.",5,70,013-002-094-092-001-070,70
2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"  I thank the Minister for her very comprehensive response. I would like to refer to a recent exchange on the Forum Pages of Lianhe Zaobao on the CPF Retirement Sum Scheme. A CPF member had complained that CPF Board would stretch his payouts over 28 years until he is 93, when he thought it should be 20 years, on the assumption if the tenure was shorter, he would get more over these 20 years.",1,71,013-002-094-092-001-071,71

So, how do you calculate? Why do you decide it is 28 and not 20? Whether CPF members can have the flexibility to choose the tenure of the payout period within the prescribed limits? And why do we still have CPF maintain this CPF Retirement Sum Scheme and only apply to people with lower CPF balances, and not include everyone on the CPF LIFE Scheme, which I believe is a superior scheme?",2,72,013-002-094-092-001-072,72
2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast),"Mr Speaker, may I have a second supplementary question which relates to this discussion about the important decision of starting at 65. So, maybe the question the Minister could answer is whether a CPF member who has chosen payouts to begin at 65 – later found out it is a better deal to delay and want to stop the payout and ask to defer to 70, can this be done? If this request is made, how do you then calculate the payouts for the remaining period? Let us say this person has enjoyed it for a year and then ask at 66, ""I want to defer to 70"", what happens?

2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,"  	Mr Speaker, Singapore has one of the highest life expectancy in the world. In 2017, more than half, one in 2 Singapore residents aged 65 was expected to live beyond 85. One in five of them was expected to live to about 95 or above. When designing the RSS payouts, initially, they were meant to last 20 years, taking into account the base interest rate on the Retirement Account, which is now 4%. So, consider the fact that they will earn 4%, consider the fact that RSS payouts should last 20 years, then you work out what the payout will be.",1,76,013-002-094-092-001-076,76
2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,"A current RSS member reaching his Payout Eligibility Age of 65 will get a base payout that will last till approximately 85. What this means, however, is that more than half of the members still alive at 85 will have no CPF payouts at all. This will be a major cause for concern. The better solution for the member to managing this longevity risk is CPF LIFE, which provides lifelong payouts. However, because CPF LIFE is mandatory only for those turning age 65 in 2023, with $60,000 in Retirement Account balance, most of our elderly will still not be on CPF LIFE, but remain on the RSS.",2,77,013-002-094-092-001-077,77
2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,"With this concern in mind, the Government introduced the CPF extra interest about 10 years ago and the additional extra interest in 2016. This bonus interest, provided by the Government, is used to extend the RSS payouts beyond 20 years. In this way, the members will enjoy payouts for longer and there is less risk that their savings will run out. But we also put in a cap, so that the payouts do not extend past 95 years old. This will already cover about four in five elderly. About 80% of them will be covered by this duration extension.",3,78,013-002-094-092-001-078,78
2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,"To the question of whether members can request for shorter payout duration under RSS. In general, the extra interest and the additional extra interest provided by the Government is used to extend the duration of the RSS payouts and reduce the risk of members outliving their savings. In some cases, CPF Board allows flexibility for members to request for a shorter payout duration. For example, members may have topped up beyond the full Retirement Sum and would have their payout duration extended. They can come forward and discuss with CPF Board how to get it shortened, for higher payouts.",4,79,013-002-094-092-001-079,79
2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,"RSS members can also consider joining CPF LIFE. Because of risk-pooling, not only will they enjoy lifelong payouts, they may also enjoy higher payouts. In fact, I am happy to share with the Member that about 92,500 RSS members have taken up CPF LIFE voluntarily. They were not mandated to do so. But they probably either did their own sums or visited a Service Centre, were shown what the payouts will look like under CPF LIFE and then decided on their own accord to sign up. The question is, why keep the RSS, why not make everybody come on-board? This is one of the challenges for CPF LIFE and indeed many Government schemes. When we introduce changes or new schemes, we have to be very careful to whom it applies. The RSS members were told that they were on RSS. We do not just decide on their behalf that they will henceforth be on CPF LIFE.",5,80,013-002-094-092-001-080,80

Here I want to be very careful about not making a generalised statement. As I explained, the circumstance may differ for every individual. So, I would urge the member to come forward, we would look at his particular circumstances and if it serves his interest, it is helpful to him, we will see how to support him.",7,82,013-002-094-092-001-082,82

It is very important to encourage those with lower CPF balances to defer their withdrawal till 70 years old so that they can get a higher payout down the road. That is one of the key objectives of this scheme. Could the CPF Board consider providing even more incentive to encourage this group, such as those with less than basic Retirement Sum in their CPF balance an even higher tiered interest rate for their balances so as to give them more incentive to defer their withdrawal.",1,83,013-002-094-092-001-083,83
2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,"  The incentives are already very generous. For every year of payouts deferred, those on CPF LIFE stand to get higher payouts of up to 7% more. If they defer it for all five years, they get up to 35% more. However, not everyone has hoisted this on-board. I am aware that the former Minister for Manpower, Lim Swee Say, for example, has conducted multiple engagement sessions in his constituency, helping his residents understand the benefits of deferring their payouts. I would very much like to encourage all Members to do likewise. CPF Board will be very happy to support you in this endeavour. The incentives are there, it is very much for the CPF members to take advantage of them.",1,84,013-002-094-092-001-084,84

Having that discussion is important. I would just like to ask a supplementary question with regards to the default age of the payouts. I understand that the rationale for putting the default at 70 is to allow for the additional benefits to the member. But at the point of the letter going out to the members, is it possible to just make it simple for them to confirm if they wish to withdraw. I know they can withdraw at the start of PEA. But it is a matter of emphasis. So, can they allow for the member to just confirm whether he wishes to have the payment, starting at 65. Because it gives the assurance that they can do it. Today, it seems that it is the other way round. It is just a matter of emphasis. And if they say no, then you can do the rest of the communications on the benefits. Or if they say yes, just to confirm with them the benefits of keeping it there. It is just to give the members the assurance that they can start the payouts.",1,85,013-002-094-092-001-085,85
2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,  The short answer is yes. We will have to take a look at the letters. I think it is best to message-test. It is probably best to gather some members and ask them which letter is intuitively easier for them to understand. We will do so.,1,86,013-002-094-092-001-086,86

I have a specific question with regards to a certain segment of the population. For example, if somebody is mentally incapacitated before 65, will it affect his trigger at 70 or 65, in the situation where he does not have a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) at 65. How will CPF handle this situation at the point when the person reaches 65 years of age? What I mean is that, if somebody is mentally incapacitated at 65 and he does not have an LPA, does he have to wait until it is triggered at 70? Or is there a specific situation in such circumstances?",1,89,013-002-094-092-001-089,89
2019-02-18,Clarification of Withdrawal of CPF Savings at Payout Eligibility Age,013-002-094-092-001,Mrs Josephine Teo,"  I would not want to speculate. The specific circumstances may differ. But in principle, the same rules apply to this individual. If by 70, there has been no instruction received, CPF Board will also stream out the payments. The challenge, of course, is whether you have the right details, such as bank account details. If he does not have the LPA, it would be very hard to see how the CPF Board could be instructed to start the payouts even before 70. But we will have to look at the specific instance, so I think best not to speculate.",1,90,013-002-094-092-001-090,90

But there are certain members whose balances are not very high. They might find a lifelong payout at those levels not very meaningful. Again, we do not presume to decide on their behalf. We say that if your balances are below a certain amount, better you decide, let us know. Quite a number have decided that they will come on-board. They are part of the 92,500 that I shared. Members not on CPF LIFE can still come on board. We will not deny them the opportunity to do so. It is just that we do not decide on their behalf.",1,92,013-002-094-092-001-092,92

So, how can we reduce this 25% repeat applicants? The second clarification is whether MSF has studied whether if we increase the duration of providing support during the first application, whether it would lead to a reduction in the number of times they will re-apply again? Which means, if we help them longer the first time, the chance of them coming back to re-apply for ComCare would be reduced.

These are networks of social and healthcare agencies within each town. We seek to integrate the support that all these organisations – both government and people sector – can provide so that we can give more holistic assistance to families, especially those who face complex needs. We also announced last year our intentions to launch hubs in rental housing estates so that we can bring together the agencies and the Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) that have been working very intimately and closely with families living in rental housing. As the Member may know, rental housing families tend to face a plethora of complex difficulties. With that integration, coordination and support amongst different agencies, we hope to better able to partner these families, tackle their issues holistically, chronologically, systematically. Empower them, partner them, support them. So, that is what we hope to achieve.",2,8,013-002-094-092-002-008,101

Certainly, six months is the median. There are some families whose needs may be more short-term, for example, they may need, say, two to three months of assistance before they transit to a new job which they can secure with or without assistance; or they may require longer term assistance because they may be undergoing more structural training, for example.

Coverage may, however, extend to include up to the next 10% of elderly. Eligible elderly receive cash payouts of between $300 and $750 every quarter, according to the type of HDB flat they live in. Recipients living in smaller flat types receive higher payouts.

In 2016, about 143,000 elderly received Silver Support payouts. Of these elderly, 33,000 no longer received Silver Support in 2019. About 14,000 had passed away while 18,000 had seen their household incomes rise above the eligibility threshold. At the same time, 42,000 elderly who were not receiving Silver Support in 2016 were assessed to be eligible for Silver Support by 2019. So, there is a net growth. Overall, the number of elderly eligible for Silver Support and the total annual amount paid out to recipients have been increasing each year.

Because lately, some of the collaterals, including replies that we have received from the agency, do not seem to mention this second group of those between the bottom 20% and 30%.

The whole idea is that if people are living in the same household, it is more reasonable to expect that they are providing mutual support to each other. There are, of course, other ways of measuring a person's level of support. You could, for example, include their family members who do not live in the same household. But having considered the different options and assessed which one of it is more intrusive to establish, we finally settled on using the household income. I accept the fact that within the same household, the level of support may not be identical. So, for those who are non-family members, in other words for example, they are unrelated people living in the same household, we do not include their income. But if they are related, including siblings, their incomes are included.

As to what concerns me and I think maybe I have got to share with Members of the House that last week, it was reported that in terms of the number of people with disabilities who are in employment which was given by the MSF as 8,600 to a parliamentary question I filed; against the total number of people of disabilities, we are looking at a percentage of about 4.88%.",1,6,013-002-094-092-009-006,149

At 5%, given the resources we have and how fast the nature of work is changing, I do fear that this group of people with disabilities would be further marginalised. It will not bring them into the workforce and, on top of that, also continue to upgrade and prepare them for the future of work. Could I please ask the Minister of State what sort of plans do we have in that regard?",2,7,013-002-094-092-009-007,150

We want to see more inclusive work spaces here in Singapore. Specific to that article, I think much of the data was picked up from data available in the open public space. However, in recent years, the Government has also started to collect more comprehensive data on persons with special needs. So, in the meantime, just bear with us because we will be releasing more accurate estimates of the employment and unemployment rates for persons with special needs later this year, once we have a better picture of the situation.",1,8,013-002-094-092-009-008,151

I think the situation has improved, as I have mentioned, today, we have got 1,600 being placed in the last three years. Certainly, we can do better. But if you look at the schemes out there, are there enough schemes? Perhaps, it can be improved. But what are the schemes like? If you look at the Open Door Programme, for example, we give training grants of up to 90% to employers to employ persons with special needs. And if you look at the Job Redesign Grant, for example, we also support up to 90%, capped at $20,000 per special needs worker for employers to redesign jobs to employ them, to modify their work environment and processes to be more inclusive for persons with special needs.",2,9,013-002-094-092-009-009,152

One of them, of course, is more qualitative – it is people's perception, of what an early childhood sector job entails. And there are certain common misconceptions that an early childhood educator is a nanny, a care-giver, rather than a teacher, a person who guides and grows a child in the early years of their development. So, to address that, we have launched, last year, a national campaign. Having consulted many members of the profession about what kinds of misperceptions people may have, and testing with them to see whether it resonates with them. Some of the messages, videos, and profiles that have gone out, seek to address people's minds, for both those who are considering entering the sector, and of course, the parents who influence and guide their children on what kinds of jobs to aspire towards, to have a more accurate view on the importance of early childhood.",1,12,013-002-094-092-011-012,173

In fact, I just met one last night at some event. One preschool teacher who was a man and the rest were women. When I speak to preschool senior educators, they talk about cultural factors.
