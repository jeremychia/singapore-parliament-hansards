In the first half of 2023, more than 3,700 mobile lines which were believed to be used in scams were flagged by the Police for termination. In addition, telcos blocked about 180 million suspected scam calls at the network level during this period.",3,7,014-002-095-117-001-007,7

22/11/2023,Adoption Rate and Effectiveness of ScamShield in Preventing Scams,014-002-095-117-001,Ms Sun Xueling,"Mr Yip Hon Weng asked about measures to identify and block scammers from using social media, e-commerce platforms and messaging mobile applications. While ScamShield is not designed to block scammers on these platforms, it serves as an additional layer of defence and has a reporting function that allows users to alert the authorities about scam calls and messages that they receive. It also complements the Government’s efforts to combat scams. For example, the Police, upon detecting or receiving reports from the public on scammers who are using social media, e-commerce or messaging apps, will ask the platform operators to remove these accounts. In the first half of 2023, more than 10,000 WhatsApp lines and 1,500 online monikers and advertisements that were believed to be used in scams were flagged out by the Police for termination.",5,9,014-002-095-117-001-009,9

Specifically, it provides the Police powers to direct online services to prevent suspected scam accounts or content from interacting with or reaching Singapore users. Police can also require designated online services to implement systems, processes or measures to counter scams, such as requiring the verification of user identities against government-issued identification documents.",6,10,014-002-095-117-001-010,10

22/11/2023,Adoption Rate and Effectiveness of ScamShield in Preventing Scams,014-002-095-117-001,Ms Sun Xueling,"Major retail banks have introduced anti-malware security features on their banking apps, which seek to protect banking customers by detecting the presence of malware on their devices, and triggering actions such as blocking access to the banking app. While ScamShield is not designed to detect or block malware, it complements the anti-malware security features on banking apps by protecting users from other attack vectors, namely scam calls and scam SMSes, hence, further mitigating the risk of users falling prey to scams.",8,12,014-002-095-117-001-012,12

I have two supplementary questions. First, to encourage usage of ScamShield, would the Ministry consider working with the Ministry of Communications and Information and have the app pre-loaded on all new handphones? If the app is pre-loaded on new handphones, it would be easier for us to roll out educational campaigns to encourage all the use ScamShield, especially for our seniors.",1,14,014-002-095-117-001-014,14
22/11/2023,Adoption Rate and Effectiveness of ScamShield in Preventing Scams,014-002-095-117-001,Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang),"Second, I understand that the Minister of State has shared that for scammers using social media, e-commerce and messaging applications such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram, the Ministry of Home Affairs actually works with the developers to remove these accounts from these platforms. So, my question, are they given a timeline as to how fast are they supposed to remove such scam accounts?",2,15,014-002-095-117-001-015,15

22/11/2023,Adoption Rate and Effectiveness of ScamShield in Preventing Scams,014-002-095-117-001,Ms Sun Xueling,"Firstly, not all users may consent to having ScamShield pre-loaded on their mobile devices.",2,17,014-002-095-117-001-017,17
22/11/2023,Adoption Rate and Effectiveness of ScamShield in Preventing Scams,014-002-095-117-001,Ms Sun Xueling,"Secondly, for ScamShield to work effectively, users actually have to set up permission settings. So, even if we were to pre-load the app, if the user does not know how to execute the permission settings, ScamShield will not be able to work effectively.",3,18,014-002-095-117-001-018,18
22/11/2023,Adoption Rate and Effectiveness of ScamShield in Preventing Scams,014-002-095-117-001,Ms Sun Xueling,"Thirdly, there is always a possibility that mobile users could deactivate or delete the app after we pre-load it.",4,19,014-002-095-117-001-019,19
22/11/2023,Adoption Rate and Effectiveness of ScamShield in Preventing Scams,014-002-095-117-001,Ms Sun Xueling,"So, for these considerations, we decided not to pre-load the ScamShield app, but we will keep this option open, if our efforts to further encourage the download of the ScamShield app does not make progress.",5,20,014-002-095-117-001-020,20
22/11/2023,Adoption Rate and Effectiveness of ScamShield in Preventing Scams,014-002-095-117-001,Ms Sun Xueling,"On the second question, we work with the app developers as well as the platforms whenever we are informed about scams that are being perpetuated on social media platforms as well as other messaging applications. There is no fixed timeline in place, but we require the operators to remove the content as soon as possible. Sometimes, some of these platforms tell us that they require some time to investigate to make sure that on their end, that it adheres to their community standards or that truly, they have conducted their investigations and that, it is, indeed, potentially a scam, and they would then need to go through their processes to remove the advertisement or the otherwise potential scam message.",6,21,014-002-095-117-001-021,21
22/11/2023,Adoption Rate and Effectiveness of ScamShield in Preventing Scams,014-002-095-117-001,Ms Sun Xueling,"So, because of these factors, there is no specific timeline that the Police has set out, but depending on the likely harm and impact, the Police would do what is within their powers to encourage the platforms to remove those scam messages as soon as possible.",7,22,014-002-095-117-001-022,22

22/11/2023,Adoption Rate and Effectiveness of ScamShield in Preventing Scams,014-002-095-117-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Can I ask the Minister of State to share if there are plans to upgrade ScamShield protection to cover other channels like emails, WhatsApp messages, and perhaps, malware, which the Minister of State said do not help in protection so far? The reason is, Mr Speaker, the Police have reported that we have already seen losses of $660 million last year and $330 million in the first half of the year. Apart from these losses are the emotional stress on victims. So, a positive reply would be appreciated.",1,24,014-002-095-117-001-024,24
22/11/2023,Adoption Rate and Effectiveness of ScamShield in Preventing Scams,014-002-095-117-001,Ms Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for his question. We should see the use of ScamShield vis-a-vis all the other efforts that the Police together with stakeholders are implementing to prevent the scourge of scams from further impacting our community and society. ScamShield largely performs the function of crowdsourcing, so that we know what are the reported scam numbers and scam messages that the Police would verify backend and then, block. But as we know, there are other stakeholders who are involved. I have talked about how the telcos at the network level have effectively blocked 180 million scam calls at their level in the first half of 2023.",1,25,014-002-095-117-001-025,25
22/11/2023,Adoption Rate and Effectiveness of ScamShield in Preventing Scams,014-002-095-117-001,Ms Sun Xueling,"So, we have to look at the use of ScamShield together with all these other channels that we are using to prevent the scourge of scams from further impacting our community.",2,26,014-002-095-117-001-026,26
22/11/2023,Adoption Rate and Effectiveness of ScamShield in Preventing Scams,014-002-095-117-001,Ms Sun Xueling,"On the point of malware, the Member would note that in recent times, the major retail banks have already rolled out anti-malware applications via the digital banking apps. The Cyber Security Agency (CSA) has also shared a list of anti-malware security apps that members of the public could download on their own. Some of these apps are for free. So, we need to consider, apart from the ScamShield app, all these other initiatives that would be helpful to the public in preventing scams from further impacting society.",3,27,014-002-095-117-001-027,27

So, to this point, would the Minister of State consider looking at a potential upgrade of ScamShield? And secondly, would the Minister of State consider further upgrades to ScamShield if further monitoring of existing initiatives do not work out as well?",1,29,014-002-095-117-001-029,29
22/11/2023,Adoption Rate and Effectiveness of ScamShield in Preventing Scams,014-002-095-117-001,Ms Sun Xueling,"I thank the Member for his questions. I shared in my main reply that, indeed, the GovTech team, specifically, is working on improving the ScamShield app. The current area that they are looking to improve is to increase the value proposition of the ScamShield app to users. For instance, a feedback we have received is that users are not aware if the ScamShield app is actually working in the background of their phones. The reason for that is because currently, ScamShield does not actively inform the user how many calls and SMSes have been blocked. The app works silently in the background. So, that is something that the GovTech team is working on.",1,30,014-002-095-117-001-030,30

22/11/2023,Adoption Rate and Effectiveness of ScamShield in Preventing Scams,014-002-095-117-001,Ms Sun Xueling,"On the point of malware, indeed, we are not just relying on the actions of the banks, we are not just relying on the digital banking apps of the banks to prevent malware. Indeed, I am aware that there could be mobile users who, unfortunately, download malware unsuspectingly, for instance, when they click on links that are tainted APK files, for instance.",4,33,014-002-095-117-001-033,33
22/11/2023,Adoption Rate and Effectiveness of ScamShield in Preventing Scams,014-002-095-117-001,Ms Sun Xueling,"From the perspective of cyber hygiene, this is something that the CSA is working actively on the ground on, together with digital ambassadors, with the Infocomms Media Development Authority, to encourage better cyber hygiene practices, so that our members of society do not unwittingly download malware. We also promote messages such as ensuring that any downloads of apps should be done from the official App Store or Google Play Store, for instance.",5,34,014-002-095-117-001-034,34

22/11/2023,Adoption Rate and Effectiveness of ScamShield in Preventing Scams,014-002-095-117-001,Ms Sun Xueling,I do not think we should see the use of the ScamShield app as the only channel and the only app that would prevent our members of society from becoming victims of scams. I would urge all of us to look at the suite of measures in its totality.,7,36,014-002-095-117-001-036,36

NLB has decided not to award a fresh contract to Udemy Business because the new licensing model will cover a much smaller number of courses than what is available today and restrict the number of users allowed to access these courses. The new licensing model is also several times more expensive than the current contract.

I do not think it would be appropriate for me to share some of the commercial sensitivities that might be tied to the proposal. But perhaps, allow me just to elaborate. It is not just about the cost per user. It is about the restricted access to the courses that are available under this new licensing model, which we do not think will meet the needs of the learners in Singapore.",1,11,014-002-095-117-002-011,46

In the past, you go to a restaurant, you pay a price at the door, you go in, it is a buffet, choose what you want, eat all you can. You can go to the cooked food section, there is a seafood section, a salad section, there are hot stations where they prepare food for you, then you have the drinks section and the desserts section. Choose what you want, eat all you can for a fixed price. But with a new model, maybe a restaurant tells you that the price that you pay at the door is a few times higher now; and you go into the restaurant, you are only entitled to a plate of rice and maybe two or three dishes from the cooked food. Anything else, you would have to top up, pay extra; and now, you are no longer able to go to the salad section, you cannot go to the drink section, you cannot go to the dessert section, you cannot go to the seafood section.",2,12,014-002-095-117-002-012,47

22/11/2023,Moneylenders (Amendment) Bill,014-002-095-117-018,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),These amendments will support the MLCB's work in encouraging financially prudent borrowing. I have three points of clarification.,2,80,014-002-095-117-018-080,335
22/11/2023,Moneylenders (Amendment) Bill,014-002-095-117-018,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My first clarification is on a licensee's discretion to obtain a credit report on a surety of the application before deciding whether to grant a loan. The new section 66A(4) permits but does not require a licensee to obtain a credit report on a surety. Can the Senior Parliamentary Secretary share if any guidance will be provided to a licensee on situations where a licensee is recommended to obtain a credit report on a surety? Can the Senior Parliamentary Secretary clarify how it will ensure that licensees do not request credit reports for purposes other than to assess the creditworthiness of a surety?,3,81,014-002-095-117-018-081,336
22/11/2023,Moneylenders (Amendment) Bill,014-002-095-117-018,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"I understand licensees face a fine or imprisonment for misrepresenting the purpose of a credit pull.

After all, when licensees make credit pulls, they are not obligated to inform those targeted about it.",4,82,014-002-095-117-018-082,337
22/11/2023,Moneylenders (Amendment) Bill,014-002-095-117-018,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My second clarification is on providing notice to the surety if the surety's information is submitted to MLCB or other parties. There is a requirement under section 66(4)(b) that the licensee must inform the applicant in writing that certain information from the applicant will be submitted to MLCB to obtain a credit report. The licensee must also inform the applicant that the information may be disclosed to other parties.,5,83,014-002-095-117-018-083,338
22/11/2023,Moneylenders (Amendment) Bill,014-002-095-117-018,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"However, section 66A(7) provides that a licensee is not required to seek the surety's consent before requesting a credit report on them. Can the Senior Parliamentary Secretary clarify why a licensee must inform an applicant that it is submitting the applicant's information to MLCB to obtain a credit report and that the information may be disclosed to other parties but it does not have to inform a surety when the surety's information is actually submitted to obtain a credit report?",6,84,014-002-095-117-018-084,339
22/11/2023,Moneylenders (Amendment) Bill,014-002-095-117-018,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My third and final clarification is on the safeguards for borrower information disclosed.

These third parties include an assistant of the licensee to collect debt, a contractor or agent to maintain the information system and any public agency to obtain any public record.",7,85,014-002-095-117-018-085,340

22/11/2023,Moneylenders (Amendment) Bill,014-002-095-117-018,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"The licensee is also required to make reasonable security arrangements to protect the information, including information in a credit report. Can the Senior Parliamentary Secretary share how these safeguards are extended to information provided to other third parties, such as assistants, contractors or agents?

Is it pertaining to the fact that  one, that the Cabinet does not have complete control over the President's appointments and that is why we need this Bill? Or is it because there are certain appointments, just like what the WP and us are saying, where he can perform his role in his official capacity, that should be no problem.

Senior Minister Teo, or for that matter the many examples I cited before him – Dr Goh and other Ministers – were acting in their private capacity in these international organisations. And that is because they were authorised to do so by the Prime Minister. There is no legal impediment for the Prime Minister to so authorise Ministers to act in their private capacity, subject to safeguards and principles, which I have just described.

One option, as I described just now, was for us to rather than authorise the President to act in his private capacity, allow the President to serve in his official capacity, but with some latitude to express his private views.
