Government funding to DACs is also means-tested, depending on each client’s income level. In FY2022, the average amount of Government grants provided to DACs was about $14,000 per client.",2,3,014-002-095-108-001-003,3

2023-07-06,Cost of Running Day Activity Centre Services for Adults with Disabilities,014-002-095-108-001,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"  I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for always helping this sector. There are issues on the ground. A lot of the charities that are running services for the moderate to high needs individuals with disabilities are facing a lot of challenges on the ground, based on this current funding model. I think the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) has been trying to help, but the challenges remain.",1,6,014-002-095-108-001-006,6
2023-07-06,Cost of Running Day Activity Centre Services for Adults with Disabilities,014-002-095-108-001,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"May I request the Ministry to convene a workgroup that comprises MSF, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the disability agencies, to deeply analyse what is the issue, what is the beef all about and why is there so much noise, worries and challenges? And then, to identify what are some alternate, a bit more innovative financing models for Day Activity Centres for disabled adults with moderate to high support needs.",2,7,014-002-095-108-001-007,7
2023-07-06,Cost of Running Day Activity Centre Services for Adults with Disabilities,014-002-095-108-001,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"Debating at a very general level and asking Parliamentary Questions (PQs) and replying to PQs at this level is not going to solve matters. The reasons are the costs are indeed high. Although the average grant is about $14,000, some of the costs can go up to about $30,000 per year.",3,8,014-002-095-108-001-008,8
2023-07-06,Cost of Running Day Activity Centre Services for Adults with Disabilities,014-002-095-108-001,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"There are also issues like fee cap and you cannot charge that much sometimes. The funding is completely means-tested and therefore, average and higher-income households are often discouraged from using the services. They will then keep their children at home and that is not always the best quality of life. And later on, there will be more costs.",4,9,014-002-095-108-001-009,9
2023-07-06,Cost of Running Day Activity Centre Services for Adults with Disabilities,014-002-095-108-001,Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar),"So, the Ministry should really study alternate models such as providing a universal base subsidy, with additional means-testing subsidy. This is what, I think, Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, when he was MSF Minister actually looked at. So, there are some models that can be considered. If we do not solve this problem, then, cohorts of graduates from the special schools with mid to high needs are really going to suffer. So, I hope that Ministry will look into this deeply with those of us who really want to solve this issue.",5,10,014-002-095-108-001-010,10
2023-07-06,Cost of Running Day Activity Centre Services for Adults with Disabilities,014-002-095-108-001,Mr Eric Chua,"  Mdm Deputy Speaker, I share the passion of the Member and I really applaud the Member, as we can see, from her very spirited delivery of her supplementary questions. I share that passion as well in doing more for the community, especially for those with moderate to severe needs. I totally agree with her that staying at home, not consuming any of these services, is not going to be the way to go.",1,11,014-002-095-108-001-011,11
2023-07-06,Cost of Running Day Activity Centre Services for Adults with Disabilities,014-002-095-108-001,Mr Eric Chua,"She mentioned the point about fee caps. We introduced that in October 2021. That helped about half of the community with some of the fees. The fee cap is anywhere between $20 and $710. Of course, there is much more that can be done. This year, we will be piloting the Enabling Services Hub. We will be launching that by the second half of this year. We will provide learning, social activities as well as respite care at locations that are closer to where persons with disabilities, including, those with moderate needs, as well as their caregivers, live.",2,12,014-002-095-108-001-012,12

2023-07-06,Actions and Lessons Resulting from SPH Media Trust's Internal Review of Overstated Circulation Numbers,014-002-095-108-002,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The first is that the events took place before SMT was formed, when the media business was under SPH Limited (SPHL), a privately listed company.",3,14,014-002-095-108-002-014,27
2023-07-06,Actions and Lessons Resulting from SPH Media Trust's Internal Review of Overstated Circulation Numbers,014-002-095-108-002,Mrs Josephine Teo,"The second point is that whatever happened had no bearing on public funds, because the Government did not have a funding relationship with SMT before the end of 2022. For avoidance of doubt, the first tranche of funding was disbursed in March 2023. In other words, the events preceded the period of funding. No public funds had been involved. Correspondingly, the question of loss of public funds does not arise.",4,15,014-002-095-108-002-015,28
2023-07-06,Actions and Lessons Resulting from SPH Media Trust's Internal Review of Overstated Circulation Numbers,014-002-095-108-002,Mrs Josephine Teo,"Third, I explained the Government’s reasons for funding SMT’s transformation, which had little to do with circulation.

After SMT was formed in December 2021, it began internally reviewing the data it took over and rectified the inconsistencies detected. Its accounts since its first financial year ending August 2022 no longer have these inconsistencies. As for the period before SMT was formed, these findings have been made public and further actions to deal with the erroneous figures are matters to be decided by the relevant parties involved then.",14,25,014-002-095-108-002-025,38
2023-07-06,Actions and Lessons Resulting from SPH Media Trust's Internal Review of Overstated Circulation Numbers,014-002-095-108-002,Mrs Josephine Teo,Ms Hany Soh filed a related question for a future Sitting. She asked if NLB had been a subscriber of SPH Media’s publications. The answer is yes. NLB’s subscription provides its members with access to various titles published by SPH Media.

In terms of the types of aquaculture activities being planned, does the Ministry have a view as to whether close-looped RAS farms which may have less impact on the surrounding ecosystems are preferred versus an open-caged sea farming, which, on the other hand, may be more energy-intensive, is a better way forward for Singapore?",2,7,014-002-095-108-003-007,122

The first one is a technical one on what type of sea farming systems, whether it is the recirculating aquaculture system, which is a closed containment type, or whether the Ministry would also support open-cage farming. I think, as far as the position for SFA and the Ministry is concerned, we are quite agnostic to the different types of technology that can be used to perform aquaculture activities because different types of sea water and sea space could be conducive for different types of farming methodology, and we do leave it to the expertise of the various farm operators to decide which platform they are more comfortable with.",1,10,014-002-095-108-003-010,125

Clearly, there are advantages and disadvantages to each type of farming methodology and the Member has also pointed out that recirculating aquaculture systems, while it may have less impact on the environment, are a lot more energy intensive. Yet, at the same time, the advantage it affords is that it has a closed containment system that allows better oxygenation of water and a purer water quality, a more controlled environment that also has the advantage of allowing a more dense stocking of the biomass.",2,11,014-002-095-108-003-011,126

At the same time, the Alliance for Action also looks at how we can educate the public to raise consumer awareness of how they can support our local produce.

I think in more advanced aquaculture countries – for example, on a recent study trip that we had undertaken with our stakeholders to Australia, we did come across this framework which the Australians used to manage aquaculture sector growth in Australia, to also help manage the environmental impact. One of the measures they have adopted is that in a region where aquaculture is deemed to be suitable, a broader environmental impact assessment is done on the overall site, but the individual operators within the site are not required to do a very onerous large-scale environmental impact study; instead, they can have a scoped-down version to make sure that there is still some assessment of the extent of the impact and they complement that with a series of more intensive environmental monitoring measures.",2,30,014-002-095-108-003-030,145

Seat belts came much later. And subsequent to seat belts, then people figured out that having an air bag is quite useful too. But these kinds of measures, they do not present themselves at the outset. We do not really know what will work. It takes research, it takes a lot of exchange of knowledge and understanding.

In order to promote road safety, actually, human society figured out that traffic lights are important. We figured out that speed limits are important. But you do not need the same speed limits on highways versus country roads.

Keep in mind that we cannot operate only on the basis of domestic interests. All of these regulations have to inter-operate with our counterparts overseas. Otherwise, our businesses will find it very difficult to meet the requirements when they operate in different jurisdictions.

Besides, the all-important operational partners of the SportsHub PPP were either local or had been based here for an extended period  venue operations fell under Global Spectrum Pico, a tie-up that includes a local company, and its facilities management was overseen by DTZ, whose presence in Asia is due to another Singaporean firm, Edmund Tie.",31,56,014-002-095-108-013-056,319

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"First, how will Government management differ in practice from the PPP model? One reason that the Government offered for pursuing the PPP approach in the first place was that it did not have the expertise. What assures us that it has the expertise now to successfully run a world-class sports and events venue? If it does not – and I am sympathetic to how we should not necessarily expect public servants to possess such talent – will we then go the route of hiring external experts; and if so, why was this not done in 2008?",39,64,014-002-095-108-013-064,327

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,It strikes me that a consultation process can help us better understand what the public has with regard to a proper and ideal use of the facility since it is meant to inspire local sports participation after all.,41,66,014-002-095-108-013-066,329
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"Second, how does the Government plan to balance community uses with profitable enterprises? For example, will there be a revision to venue rentals now that the Government has taken over the Sports Hub? In particular, will there be a distinction between commercial rental and community ones? After all, one reason why the substantial takeover fees were paid was ostensibly to remove commercial barriers for local sports promotion.",42,67,014-002-095-108-013-067,330
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"Minister Tong has already alluded to some of these in his earlier speech under the rubric of ActiveSG and Kallang Alive, including ""National School Games, Singapore Youth Festival performances"", and possibly even the ""National Day Parade"". He even hoped for a ""return of the casual stroller or jogger to the stadium"".",43,68,014-002-095-108-013-068,331
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"If the concern is understandably the crowding out of commercial returns due to the latter, we could perhaps consider scheduling community use events during clear downtimes when the facilities are not being used. But if indeed the Government will not operate the Sports Hub under the same assumptions as SHPL, how much does it expect to incur on an annual basis for operation in the years ahead, and how will this differ from the original sums paid to SHPL?",44,69,014-002-095-108-013-069,332

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"I promise I am not going to circulate any more handouts, but I will quickly summarise. In the latest Budget estimates, SportsSG currently accounts for the ongoing expenditures of a little less than $391 million, with development expenditures of close to $123 million. This comes to $514 million. There is a separate budget line for the sports programme, with an operating expenditure of $41 million and development expenditure of $470,000. Taken together, we devote just about $556 million, or half a percent of total fiscal expenditures, to sport.",46,71,014-002-095-108-013-071,334
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"Of this, the Sports Hub consumed around $57 million in fiscal 2022, in the form of capital grants. There was an extraordinary development expenditure charge of close to $1.4 billion, in fiscal 2022, which presumably was the upfront termination fee. But there are additional operational costs of $800 million which will have to be incurred through till 2035. I am assuming that these will be accounted for on an annual basis and will show up in the Budget statements in future, but I am happy to stand corrected if I am incorrect.",47,72,014-002-095-108-013-072,335
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"If we agree with these numbers, then the next step is to ask if such expenditures should be giving us more bang for the buck.",48,73,014-002-095-108-013-073,336

Japan spends a mere 0.02%, and yes, you heard that right, of its government budget on sport. And in Korea, the entire Ministry of Culture Sport and Tourism, which notably includes massive expenditures on promoting Korean culture via Hallyu, comes to only 1.3% of the national budget, with sports accounting for just 0.3% percent.",49,74,014-002-095-108-013-074,337

I can confidently say that football has the strongest following among Singaporeans as compared to any other sports. Football is also known to be a unifying sport as it brings together the different segments of society, regardless of socioeconomic status, race, language and religion. While this is not unique to Singapore, our football culture has its unique characteristics. We have our Kallang Roar and Kallang Wave, named for the location of our former National Stadium, where fans always turned out in droves to support our Lions in every home match when they competed in the Malaysian League and Cup competitions. That experience fostered a sense of our shared bonds and a feeling of oneness and pride of supporting our national teams, as each fan became a part of the Kallang Roar and Wave.",6,89,014-002-095-108-013-089,352

Many are still painfully waiting for the revival of our Lions, expressing our concerns, sharing views and perspectives, but regrettably, there are quite a big number who have lost faith and given up after our Lions' poor performance in AFF Championships 2022 and the 32nd SEA Games, followed by two recent uninspiring international friendlies.",7,90,014-002-095-108-013-090,353

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"To begin with, let us look at where Singapore currently stands in the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) rankings. Our men's national team is currently ranked at 158th place. The highest ranking we ever attained was 73rd in 1993, while the lowest is 173rd in 2018 and our average is 127th. At the peak of our FIFA ranking, our men's football national team in 1993 was made up of popular footballers, such as Fandi Ahmad, V Sundramoorthy, Malek Awab, Nazri Nasir, Rafi Ali and other excellent players. This means that in the three decades since we achieved our highest ranking, we have dropped by a remarkably disappointing 85 places, which is also 31 places below our average. Since we hit bottom in 2018, we improved by 15 places in five years. But this minor improvement is a small consolation for the players and fans who are struggling to understand how we have failed to improve over the years despite all the efforts put in. Our recent results demonstrate that where many other countries in the region have improved, Singapore football has fallen behind.",10,93,014-002-095-108-013-093,356
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, the right efforts are needed to formulate the right programmes and approaches to better our football situation. We need to see what had worked and what did not work in the past, so we can dissect, review, finetune and come up with the best efforts and measures in improving our football. I believe any changes that need to be made should start with setting of a Goal or Vision for Singapore Football. I believe that both the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) and the Government understand this. In 1998, then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong had this vision – Goal 2010, to qualify for the World Cup in that year. We obviously did not make it, but we had a brief glimmer of hope when our junior Lions won 3rd place during the inaugural Youth Olympic Games (YOG) hosted in Singapore. That team, coached by former player Kadir Yahaya, seemed to hold promise for a brighter future in Singapore football. I will speak more on that unfulfilled promise later.",11,94,014-002-095-108-013-094,357
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"More recently, in August 2019, it was reported in the media that the then-Vice President of FAS, Mr Edwin Tong mentioned that, I quote, ""FIFA World Cup 2034 will be a realistic goal for Singapore."" On this matter, I had asked the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) through a Parliamentary Question in September 2019, as well as in my Committee of Supply 2020 cut on FAS' strategic plans in achieving this goal. MCCY's replies were that the Ministry was waiting for FAS to advise them on their plans.",12,95,014-002-095-108-013-095,358
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Nonetheless, in March 2021, FAS, as reported in the media, shared that the World Cup 2034 is an ""aspirational target"". Pertaining to World Cup 2034, I would like to seek two clarifications. One, FAS has announced in August 2019 that World Cup 2034 is a realistic goal. Meanwhile, in March 2021, FAS set it as an ""aspirational target"". Can FAS or MCCY confirm whether it is the former or the latter?",13,96,014-002-095-108-013-096,359
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Second, I would like to, once again, ask for updates from FAS or MCCY on the strategic plans in achieving this realistic goal or aspirational target. I note that there are plans to launch an Under-17 league in 2024, and also to train talent scouts, which were announced in May 2023 during a consultation exercise. But surely, there has to be more to the roadmap.",14,97,014-002-095-108-013-097,360
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, aspirational targets are well and good, but there also needs to be a healthy dose of reality injected. If we cannot even advance beyond the group stages in regional competitions, making it to the World Cup is nothing short of a fantasy. And even if by some miracle, we were to meet that unlikely aspirational target, we are likely to be utterly humiliated.",15,98,014-002-095-108-013-098,361
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Before we even think about the World Cup, why not we first try to qualify for the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Asian Cup in 2036? Historically, our national football team has participated in the AFC Cup since its inception. However, the only time we have ever qualified for the final round was in 1984 – as the host country. We have never made it past the qualifying rounds on our own steam. Let us set our sights on the AFC Asian Cup and develop a roadmap towards that goal. The roadmap can include milestones, such as winning the AFF Championship and maybe even gold at the SEA Games in a decade. In this manner, there is greater accountability as well. And if we need to revisit the strategy along the way and tweak it here and there, so be it. It is better than setting an aspirational target that is plain unrealistic.",16,99,014-002-095-108-013-099,362
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"Madam, in any sport, the seeds for success must be sown early. In 2021, FAS announced the introduction of ""Unleash The Roar"" (UTR). Once again, as I did in my Committee of Supply 2022 speech, I welcome the small steps that have been taken under the UTR project, such as the setting up of School Football Academies and partnerships with global leaders in football, such as clubs from the Spanish premier La Liga.",17,100,014-002-095-108-013-100,363
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"This is not the first time that FAS has tried to implement youth development programmes. One example is the Junior Centres of Excellence (JCOE) which was implemented in 2011. If we go back further, we have the Milo Soccer School. For those who may be too young to remember, the Milo Soccer School was a key youth development programme in the 1980s and 1990s which gave birth to many of our nation's football heroes, among them are Fandi Ahmad, Nazri Nasir and Lee Man Hon.",18,101,014-002-095-108-013-101,364
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),"So, we know that youth development is not a new idea for Singapore football. But we also have to confront our failures in youth development, despite the investment of time and resources. In 2015, then-FAS technical Director Michel Sablon, in a media report, praised JCOEs and mentioned that with further improvement of this programme, he was confident that Singapore's national team can be like Japan's by 2020. Maybe Mr Sablon was being over-enthusiastic in speaking to the media; maybe his sense of optimism was hopelessly misplaced. We may never know.",19,102,014-002-095-108-013-102,365

This team created history for our football when they won a bronze medal at the tournament.

And yet, a review of their fortunes a decade later told a story of a lost generation of footballers. I would like to quote some of these players sharing their woes, which was reported in one of our local online media, first quote  ""After the YOG, there was no follow-up… We had no coach and we didn't even have a single training session for seven or eight months""; another quote, ""While much was promised, in terms of on-the-ground work, nothing was really done.

In 2019, I noted that former national player and coach Fandi Ahmad had made reference to a ""unique ecosystem"" in Singapore football which he felt was important for the coach of our national team to understand.

I brought this up as I met and spoke to a couple of Singapore's ex-internationals who shared that they do not encourage their children to pursue their dreams to start a football career.

As I have mentioned in the earlier part of my speech that football is a unifying sport as it brings together the different segments of society regardless of socio-economic status, race, language and religion, making Singapore football great again will bring the revival of Kallang Roar and the Kallang Wave which our nation has been patiently waiting for almost three decades.

To say that he routinely thumbed his nose at authority is probably an understatement. In March 1966, he consciously objected to being drafted to serve in the Vietnam War and earned the ire of those in authority, which he referred to as the ""white establishment"". His sense of universal justice was captured for posterity in his famous words, ""Why should they ask me to put on a uniform and go 10,000 miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people in Vietnam, while so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights.""",11,131,014-002-095-108-013-131,394

Noh Alam Shah gave his heart and soul when in national colours. But he had a temperamental side and was involved in violent conduct, conduct which cannot be condoned.

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),We owe a profound debt of gratitude to our athletes who proudly fly the Singapore flag in tournaments like the SEA Games and Para Games. They have sacrificed through their long hours of training and through rising to the challenge of intensely competitive sports where they might face the agony of defeat as easily as the thrill of victory.,2,220,014-002-095-108-013-220,483
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"For our athletes, we must not be only be passive spectators. We must, on occasions like this Parliamentary Sitting, honour them with the respect they deserve for their efforts.",3,221,014-002-095-108-013-221,484
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"But as we honour and respect our athletes for what they have done in the past, we must be bold to set ambitious goals for the nation's sporting future. This speaks to the second part of the motion by Prof Lim and Mr Faisal Manap. We must strive to enhance our sports ecosystem such that our athletes will find sports a rewarding and sustainable career and that there can be a thriving, commercially attractive ecosystem for other stakeholders, including commercial sponsors and advertisers.",4,222,014-002-095-108-013-222,485
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Madam, in my speech, I will touch on a few themes  firstly, setting national goals for what we want to achieve in the sporting arena; secondly, uplifting sports that are less well-known and celebrated than, say, football; thirdly, investing enough and early enough in talent; lastly, creating a commercially viable sports ecosystem.",5,223,014-002-095-108-013-223,486
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"First of all, Madam, what kinds of goals do we want to set for sports nationally? For every country, there would always be a tension across various goals, for example, cultivating peaks of excellence versus encouraging mass participation, or shining the spotlight on our local athletes while also seeking economic benefits from global leagues and foreign athletes and teams.",6,224,014-002-095-108-013-224,487
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),I will argue that such goals are not mutually exclusive and sufficient weight can be given to disparate goals. I would argue that we should embrace four goals for Singapore sports at the national level.,7,225,014-002-095-108-013-225,488
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Firstly, to achieve and celebrate excellence in sports in general.

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Secondly, to focus state resources most on those sports where we can feasibly achieve regional and global excellence as well as in football, which has a unique, exceptional significance from the standpoint of heritage, national pride and the potential for bonding. To do justice to those resources, such efforts have to involve regular, hard-nosed reviews of the successes and failures of past policy, such as my colleague Mr Faisal Manap called for earlier in the context of FAS.",9,227,014-002-095-108-013-227,490

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Fourthly, to convert that mass interest and participation deriving from sporting excellence into a vibrant business ecosystem whereby the sports industry and its athletes can derive a larger share of revenues from the private sector. This last goal is particularly important if we want to make the sports industry sustainable and attractive to athletes, other sports industry professionals and commercial participants versus being an excessively government-dependent industry.",11,229,014-002-095-108-013-229,492
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"The last goal is probably where we need the most work. We have to attract strong audiences and spending, which in turn will attract commercial sponsorship, participation and advertising, which in turn can generate the money needed to spark more excellence, in a virtuous cycle. It does not make sense to speak of a commercial strategy when there is no audience interest. The horse has to come before the cart.",12,230,014-002-095-108-013-230,493

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"One important thrust in our sporting efforts should be to focus on those sports where Singapore has done well so as to focus support on our athletes there so that they sustain and surpass their achievements, analyse and act on the reasons for that success, have our National Sports Associations (NSAs) engage these top performers aggressively to be coaches, advisors and role models to inspire others to take up the sport, and stimulate media coverage and draw more attention and audience numbers to these less well-known sports.",14,232,014-002-095-108-013-232,495

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"I am not claiming that nothing has been done by the Government for these less well-known sports, but I am arguing for a more aggressive approach of using our resources to study our regional and world-class athletes in these sports, try to spark more people entering these sports, focus more of our funding dollars on such sports where we are really good and draw more attention and interest to these sports, not only the famous ones.",16,234,014-002-095-108-013-234,497
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),Let me touch on some examples of sports that are less well-known but where Singaporean athletes have done well regionally or globally.,17,235,014-002-095-108-013-235,498
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"Firstly, let me talk about darts. We have a national champion in this sport.

His story is an interesting one, the story of a person fuelled by passion without necessarily having the backing of resources.",18,236,014-002-095-108-013-236,499
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In a story in TODAY Online from 2017, Paul recounted that in the early part of his journey in darts, he struggled.

For my first two years, I had no sponsors and I depended on my savings and my job.""",19,237,014-002-095-108-013-237,500

Soft-tips are plastic which allows for the scoring to be done automatically. Matches can be played online via the electronic dartboards. This makes it more player-friendly, which in turns draws a huge, younger crowd that is willing to spend.",20,238,014-002-095-108-013-238,501
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied),"In the same article, Paul noted that the soft-tip darts scene has exploded in Singapore too. He estimated that there were around 20,000 players here. ""Singapore has one of the most lucrative and active darts scenes in the world,"" he said. But agitation creeps into his voice when the state of the local steel-tip scene is brought up. ""I feel really angry,"" he said, and I am quoting from the article here.",21,239,014-002-095-108-013-239,502

I tried to find out if an NSA for darts still exists, and it does not appear that one does. I am aware that SportsSG does provide support for athletes in sports where there is no NSA, but it begs the question why there is no NSA and more concerted efforts in a field like darts, where we have world-class athletes and hence the potential to build on that.",24,242,014-002-095-108-013-242,505

Indeed, Singapore recently hosted the world's top tournament in this sport – the International 2022 – with a prize pool of above S$25 million. Given the tremendous commercial potential for this sport, it deserves the kind of close analysis of success and targeted support that I spoke about.

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"Regardless of any Government participation to support any sports or games, achievement in sports requires an athlete’s passion, his desire to overcome obstacles to nurture a strong fighting spirit and a strong desire to achieve will always take precedence over any evaluation. Similarly, you can provide perks and have a goal like having our national soccer team participate in the World Cup finals. When it is unrealistic, we must be able to admit that some goals are not quite possible to score yet.",38,330,014-002-095-108-013-330,593

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Mark Chay,"  Sorry. The first clarification that I have is for Assoc Prof Jamus Lim on the nature of para sports and the economic considerations versus the performance that our para-athletes have in relation to national funding. I am not an economics professor, but there are also positive externalities when it comes to having an economy that is doing well, in terms of healthcare, in terms of care for patients as well. So, I think that also speaks to the talent pool when we talk about the number of athletes representing our para-athlete contingent.",1,336,014-002-095-108-013-336,599

When it comes to the whole landscape of para-athletes, we also need to consider that because of our economic stability, safety, national defence, the pool of para-athletes is actually not very large. So, I would just like to ask Assoc Prof Jamus Lim if he has actually considered these in his comments.",3,338,014-002-095-108-013-338,601

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"  I thank the Member for the clarification although I am a little befuddled as to what the specificity of the question is. I think I, at no point, suggested that our para-athletes were underperforming because we have a small population. If anything, I think the fact that our para-athletic team has done so well is something that we all feel extremely proud of. Later on, I believe some of my Workers' Party colleagues will elaborate more on helping to further improve the diversity and inclusiveness of our sports scene, which includes the para-athletes' performance. I hope this clarifies. Again, I am not entirely clear what the specificity of the Member's quarrel with what I had said earlier was.",1,345,014-002-095-108-013-345,608

I think I might have misunderstood, but my clarification is on the rankings of the other Southeast Asia nations, as opposed to ours. And how our para-athletes have performed in terms of total medal tally.",1,347,014-002-095-108-013-347,610

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"  That is how our para-athletes performed, and I can take the opportunity to clarify the earlier point that Ms Poh Li San said. Exactly the same as our normal athlete team in the sense that they were both ranked seventh in total medal count and Ms Poh Li San mentioned that the regular team secured six, which is correct, if you look at the fact that gold medals are counted differentially. But in the statement that I made earlier on, it was about total medal count. And in total medal count, we had the same performance, which was seventh in both cases of the regular SEA Games as well as the Paralympic Games.",1,349,014-002-095-108-013-349,612

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Mark Chay,"  Yes, of course. When it comes to sports, you cannot just look at the socio-economic background of a country specifically. You have to look at it as a whole. I think that is the question that I had for Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, whether he considered it as a whole, not just looking at our economic status in the region.",1,357,014-002-095-108-013-357,620

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"  I thank the Member for his clarification. And indeed, I emphasised in the speech that there were many elements, including the fact that we have a small population that does affect the relative performance of our national teams, whether in terms of the SEA Games or the Para Games. But if anything, socioeconomic status tends to drive a great deal of the performance outcomes. And in that regard specifically, it is clear to me, at least based on the data, that we massively underperformed.",1,359,014-002-095-108-013-359,622

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Mark Chay,"  Yes, Mdm Deputy Speaker. Actually, I do have another clarification for the Leader of the House pertaining to his comments about —",1,361,014-002-095-108-013-361,624
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mdm Deputy Speaker,  Do you mean the Leader of the Opposition?,1,362,014-002-095-108-013-362,625
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Mark Chay,"  Yes, the Leader of the Opposition. Regarding our silat athletes and swimmers, I just want to clarify that for the silat athlete, whether he is aware that the drink-driving incident actually happened on 27 November 2022 and the silat competition at the SEA Games actually happened on 18 May 2023. So, that falls outside the Code of Conduct and the Athletes' Agreement.",1,363,014-002-095-108-013-363,626

I think we have clarified this in the House before that the swimmers admitted to the consumption of marijuana. There was no presence of marijuana. There was no criminal act of proceedings or infringements here. So, I just wanted to clarify that and ask if he is aware of that as well.",2,364,014-002-095-108-013-364,627
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Mark Chay,"Also, SNOC called the disciplinary committee (DC) for the swimmers. They were sanctioned. They paid a fine and this was all done before the selection for the SEA Games.",3,365,014-002-095-108-013-365,628

While I note the points he is making, they do not detract from the larger point vis-à-vis those two issues which I raised, which was that SNOC has a track record of looking and displaying a forgiving attitude towards athletes who may have committed transgressions. I think that is the key point, which I hope SNOC can also take into account and the Ministry also can take into account for other athletes who may have fallen short.",1,367,014-002-095-108-013-367,630

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Mark Chay,"  Yes. I am not a member of SNOC. I just followed the proceedings quite independently. But I was on the Selection Committee in 2021 when we decided not to send Soh Rui Yong for various reasons. But I do want to say that these athletes have had their disciplinary committees, they have already served their penalties. They paid their fines. They were sorry and we have all moved on. So, SNOC does have that track record of that.",1,372,014-002-095-108-013-372,635
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Mark Chay,"I would like to also state that for the case of Soh Rui Yong, an Appeals Committee was convened, a special committee or hearing was actually held for Soh Rui Yong. He seemed very sorry for what he had done. There was also a commitment from him to — I am not going to go into the details of the commitment. Well, with respect to the commitment, he said that he would not make disparaging comments and he would abide by the Code of Conduct, that he was sorry.",2,373,014-002-095-108-013-373,636
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Mark Chay,"He went to the SEA Games well and good, right? So, he did participate in the SEA Games. When he came back, he did a podcast and he made disparaging comments not only about SNOC, but about his teammate as well. So, that was the result of his non-selection in the Asian Games in 2023.",3,374,014-002-095-108-013-374,637
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Mark Chay,"I would also like to say that this is not uncommon in the world. I think in 2016, Kento Momota, for badminton, he was ranked number one. He was gambling and he broke the Code of Conduct, and he was also not allowed to attend the 2016 Rio Olympic Games, even though he was ranked number one.",4,375,014-002-095-108-013-375,638
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Mark Chay,"But I think to say that Soh Rui Yong was not allowed to compete, he can still compete, not at the major games, but at Singapore Athletics sanctioned meets. I believe that Singapore Athletics believes that he still abides by the Code of Conduct and they still select him and nominate him for these games. So, he can still compete, he can still break national records, but not at the major games. Where leniency was given, he took advantage of the situation. He broke his, I guess, commitment. And that is why he was not selected for the Asian Games.",5,376,014-002-095-108-013-376,639

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Pritam Singh,"  I would like to thank the Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) for his interventions. I think I have mentioned a few times in my speech and I was careful to do it to restate that it is important for athletes to abide by standards of discipline. Soh Rui Yong is my resident. So, I am appealing also as his Member of Parliament. And if SNOC can take another look at him, I am not out of order, I believe, to raise this matter. And – given that the matter actually goes far beyond, in the eyes of many, just to be an issue of transgressions – I hope more senior members of our sporting fraternity can come in and try to lower temperatures, so that athletes like Soh Rui Yong can participate and fly the flag proudly.",1,378,014-002-095-108-013-378,641

Would the hon Member recognise that or does he feel that the data is wrong or he feels that it is not appropriate to make that comparison, to analyse the data in that way?",1,396,014-002-095-108-013-396,659

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Mark Chay,"There are many different factors and, if you ask me, high performance takes time. We celebrate the accomplishments of our aquatic fraternity; we came back with 23 gold medals at the Southeast Asian Games. But there was a time that our men's team did not have a gold medal after Ang Peng Siong, 1993, where he swam in the 50-metre freestyle. I was a Primary 5 kid, a basket kid, taking the track suits out. But that was inspiring.",2,398,014-002-095-108-013-398,661

Does he feel that we should exercise exactly the same modicum of patience with all the other areas that Singapore rightly excels in, on international stage? Whether we are happy that we have taken 20 years and, if anything, we have fallen much further away in terms of the relative performance of our football team, even as we have gotten relatively richer?",1,402,014-002-095-108-013-402,665
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Mark Chay,"  I thank the hon Member for his comments. Definitely for sports, I say we need to take a measured approach where we are very young in this whole idea of sports administration and high performance. We started building our facilities back in 1960s and 1970s only. We were playing football in Padang and Farrer Park.

I do not claim to be an expert but when you are dealing with 11 men on one team and 11 men on the other team, a lot of things can happen.",4,406,014-002-095-108-013-406,669

We should thus not define sporting success only by medals won or quantitative targets attained.

My daughter is an active junior competitive swimmer. She is 11-plus, but as a parent, I have already seen the kind of stresses and pressure that competitive athletes at that level go through – training six times a week, two hours per session, more than 50-60 laps each time, in the pool at six in the morning, juggling their homework and so on. So, I am truly heartened and am a big advocate of making sure that we have that mental and emotional wellness support for our athletes as well, both young and the not-so-young.",12,420,014-002-095-108-013-420,683

The original Motion mentioned just one of several objectives, for example, goals for sporting success, where the last limb can be construed as being about medals or qualifications for international tournaments. I think success should be measured beyond just that one particular quantitative marker. Also, our broader objectives of sports are to help athletes reach their maximum potential and also to broaden participation in sports, rally our communities, foster national pride and cohesion, or even just about being the best version of yourself that you can be. As I tell my daughter, it is not about winning the medals, it is about improving your personal best every time you go into the pool.

We all know how successful Venus and Serena Williams became. There are also many other instances of fraught relationships between parents and their child athletes, even to the point of abuse.

This coincides with the time Singaporean students are the busiest, preparing for their PSLE, ""O"" level and ""A"" level examinations. Training for just a few hours a week with the school's co-curricular activity (CCA)'s sports team is not high performance training and this pace of training will generally limit the students' success in their sport to inter-school sports competitions.",10,483,014-002-095-108-013-483,746

It is not a ticket out of poverty in Singapore as it is in some countries. Even if we look at some of the highest paying sports like golf and tennis, only athletes ranked in the top 150 or so in the world earn enough price money to support themselves.

The Sports School can arrange more sharing sessions at various primary schools nationwide in addition today existing Sports School open house. It could also invite the high performing athletes in primary schools for holiday camps at the Sports School during the school holidays. These will enable the young athletes and parents to better understand and familiarise themselves with the Sports School.

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"If your child has aspirations to become a world-class athlete, encourage them to pursue their dreams, take the time to spend to find out the available pathways and support them within your means. The path will be less well-trodden than the ones most of their peers are taking and there is no guarantee of success. It is therefore important to focus on enjoying the journey, not just the destination.",41,514,014-002-095-108-013-514,777
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),"In conclusion, Madam, sport has the potential to rally our nation together behind the common cause. When Singaporeans cheer in support of our sportsmen and women, listen to Majulah Singapura playing at the podium or see Singaporean athletes giving them all on the field, in the pool or on the court, we all feel an immense rush of pride in our nation. Yet, for a nation as wealthy and as diverse as Singapore, our record of performance in sports on the world stage leaves much to be desired.",42,515,014-002-095-108-013-515,778
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied),I have outlined four suggestions aimed at improving Singapore's sporting ecosystem to build a stronger and more sustainable pipeline of high performance athletes in Singapore. This will help us take steps towards realising our goals for sporting success over the coming decades and for many decades to come. I strongly support the Motion standing in the names of my hon friends Assoc Prof Jamus and Mr Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap.,43,516,014-002-095-108-013-516,779

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"  Mdm Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate. My speech will cover the following four points  first, I support the Motion where we acknowledge the hard work by our athletes and our para-athletes; second, I will highlight why broad-based accessible programming to encourage more people to participate in sports is key in building up our talent pool for high performance sports; third, I will speak on the need to ensure inclusivity through sports; and fourth, as a lifelong football fan, I hope to offer some suggestions for Singapore's football to once again, reach the heights of the 1980s and 1990s.",1,518,014-002-095-108-013-518,781
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Madam, I would like to begin by congratulating our TeamSG athletes and para-athletes for their commendable results at this year’s Southeast Asian Games and the ASEAN Para Games. TeamSG won a total of 158 medals at the SEA Games while our para-athletes brought home a total of 44 medals. This was our second-best away performance of all time behind the 2017 ASEAN Para Games.",2,519,014-002-095-108-013-519,782
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"While news about our best-performing athletes and para-athletes, especially those who have consecutively broken records, might dominate news headlines and deservedly generate the most hype, we must also not forget the rest of our athletes who did not win medals. Every athlete trains hard and they sacrifice their time with family and friends with every intention of doing their best for themselves and for the country they represent. They were not in the competitions just to make up the numbers.",3,520,014-002-095-108-013-520,783

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Madam, to achieve success at the elite sports level, a systematic and comprehensive approach to identify, nurture and develop TeamSG athletes is important. Broad-based accessible programming that encourages sports participation will be a key part of this approach, as we need a broad participation base from which we can identify and develop sporting talent.",5,522,014-002-095-108-013-522,785
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),I personally know how challenging it is to organise such sporting programmes and keep the participation strong.,6,523,014-002-095-108-013-523,786
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Years ago, in 2011, I started the Delta League programme. It is now a bi-annual youth engagement programme that aims to engage youths through football and keep them meaningfully occupied during the long June and December school holidays. Jointly organised by the Police and the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC), there are also talks and activities besides the football clinics and matches that inculcate in our youths a sense of social responsibility, teamwork and discipline.",7,524,014-002-095-108-013-524,787

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"It is important to have events like these to encourage everyone to come together to play sports, regardless of age, ability and background.

I note that the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) has commissioned a panel to conduct a review of the team’s performances and will share their findings and recommendations soon. I would, nonetheless, like to give some suggestions on how we can improve the state of our football.",15,532,014-002-095-108-013-532,795
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"I start with our lack of dedicated infrastructure and facilities.

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Today, as some Members have already highlighted, we cannot even play football at our void decks and many of our neighbourhoods’ school football fields and parks have restricted use. This scarcity restricts the number of local talents that can be groomed and inhibits the organising of more football events and competitions, which then limits the exposure that our players receive. Hence, it is vital for us to invest in the development of infrastructure to provide our athletes with the necessary ecosystem of support and opportunities.",17,534,014-002-095-108-013-534,797
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Next, we must improve the way we groom our pipeline of football talents. We need to establish a robust talent scouting and recruitment system to identify early promising players. Only by identifying them early when they are young and by continuously nurturing them can Singapore build a strong pool of players who can contribute to the national team and compete internationally.",18,535,014-002-095-108-013-535,798
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"One of the best ways I found of scouting our talents is to search from the grassroots, and the Delta League is one good example. The tournament sees about 2,000 young players every year. And over the years, some of them have been scouted to play at club level and, eventually, some have gone on to train with the national teams. FAS can and should widen its talent scouting and recruitment systems to encompass the many hidden gems in our community. And I welcome the FAS scouts to attend our Delta League matches.",19,536,014-002-095-108-013-536,799
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Third, we must also establish strong partnerships with professional clubs and leagues worldwide to help groom our local talents.

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"  Mdm Deputy Speaker, today I will speak about the development of Singapore as a sporting nation for all. I believe that sporting success, as the original Motion calls for, should not only be measured in terms of winning medals and doing well in various rankings, but also measured in terms of wider participation in sports across all segments of society.",1,550,014-002-095-108-013-550,813
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Specifically, I will talk about how we do on accessibility and participation in sports, and how this measurement should form an important part of our national developmental dashboard, an idea I first raised in Parliament in early 2022. I will also touch on inclusion in sports, from how we provide for the mental well-being of our athletes, to the crucial and important role that sports plays to work with and support persons with disabilities, and also neurodiverse individuals.",2,551,014-002-095-108-013-551,814
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"SportsSG recently released its National Sport Participation Survey (NSPS), which took place for the five years between 2018 and 2022. It tracks sports participation across a few indicators and it is heartening to see that for once, there appears to be a positive correlation associated with the pandemic  that regular sports participation rates increased to an all-time high of 74% last year. This is clearly an achievement worth celebrating and I hope that this can be maintained.",3,552,014-002-095-108-013-552,815
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Yet, we must continue to improve, to look to countries like Norway, where in 2021 a whopping 97% of those aged 16 and above participated in outdoor activities, and 86.9% stated that they had participated in various exercise activities.",4,553,014-002-095-108-013-553,816
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"We should include measures of sporting success as part of a development dashboard tracking our country's holistic development. If we want to shift our focus towards holistic societal well-being rather than keeping a narrow focus on an increasingly outdated measure that is GDP, sports indicators should be one of the first places we should look at. This is because one, access to sports needs to be a right for residents in Singapore, especially as it embodies dignity, equality and other values Singaporeans agree should form the core of our society.",5,554,014-002-095-108-013-554,817

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"As my WP colleagues have spoken about participation in sports at the top levels, I would like to share some observations about more general participation in sports in our daily life, which I believe should be a key part of our measurement of sporting success.",7,556,014-002-095-108-013-556,819
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Besides the obvious benefits outlined above, I believe participation in sports at any level can teach us many life lessons that will stand us in good stead as we go along our path in life. I was for most of my early years fairly bookish and sedentary, and did not particularly enjoy any type of physical activity. Yet, this changed at university, when I was persuaded by friends to attend a football training session for our college one weekend in my first week.",8,557,014-002-095-108-013-557,820

It was to be the start of my three-year journey with what eventually became known as the Corpus Terriers, as we cobbled together a ragtag group of students – both undergraduates and postgraduates – to become a good enough team that progressed from the bottom league, to gaining promotion twice to the league above in the university league tables.",9,558,014-002-095-108-013-558,821

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"What participation in these sports taught me was not about winning or losing, but about the importance of perseverance and being there for your teammates. It did not matter if you were out in a nightclub or panic writing an essay until three in the morning the night before. Come 6 30 am the next morning, whatever the weather, you were expected to be there on the river ready to start training, or else you would be the reason the rest of the team was unable to go out on the water.",11,560,014-002-095-108-013-560,823

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"The time we spent together as friends, as a team, on the river and the playing fields, more than the hours spent trying to make sense of dense and opaque scientific journal articles, are what I remember when I think of my time at university, almost two decades on. They also gave us important lessons in grit, resilience, risk-taking and the importance of having each other's backs – skills that ring through across so many areas of life long after leaving the formal education system. It also teaches us how to deal with often very strong negative emotions in a healthy manner. Experiencing firsthand the physical and mental health benefits of participating in sports made it easier for me to make a conscious effort to carve out time and to seek out suitable sporting activities to fit my current circumstances despite busy work and family schedules especially here in Singapore.",13,562,014-002-095-108-013-562,825
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),What these experiences taught me is that we need to work to ensure that all of us – no matter who or where we are in life – are able to understand the benefits of sports – particularly organised sports – and reap these benefits.,14,563,014-002-095-108-013-563,826
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Starting from our very young, we have to continue to work to make sports and physical activity fun for all children, and to find ways to sustainably incorporate it into daily life in a way that complements, and not competes with academic learning. It can be as simple as stopping ourselves from shouting at our young children to stop when they have a sudden impulse to run or jump, but instead pause and ask them how they can run or jump in a manner that is both safe and situationally appropriate. As our children grow up, the sporting ecosystem has to evolve to be supportive and accessible enough to allow them to choose a sport they enjoy and have an interest in, at a level of participation they are comfortable with, and that fits into their current life circumstances.",15,564,014-002-095-108-013-564,827
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"And while we are on the topic of participation, we also must not neglect the important role of our participation in sports as spectators. While the National Sport Participation Survey (NSPS) found that there appeared to be high levels of positive responses associated with a sense of national pride in our achievements in sports, how does this translate into attendance at live sporting events? After all, any competitive athlete will tell you that competing live is a truly unique and irreplaceable experience, and that the roar of the crowd is often instrumental in their performance during the match or race, and home support can make the difference between victory or defeat.",16,565,014-002-095-108-013-565,828
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Yet, this seems to be an area which we struggle with. One highly publicised example in recent months was the cap that the Football Association of Singapore applied to limit the number of fans for Team Singapore football friendly matches at the National Stadium to a paltry 5,000. Apart from being extremely frustrating for fans, attendance numbers today are also a far cry from the regular 50,000-strong crowds during our Malaysian Cup and Super League halcyon days of the 1970s and 1980s. This is also a contrast against the huge queues with fans camping overnight for tickets to matches, which even resulted in a tragic stampede in 1977 which resulted in casualties and even a life lost. Contrast sports event attendance too, to the fans who flooded the internet and even started camping from yesterday for tickets for when Taylor Swift will play at the National Stadium next year.",17,566,014-002-095-108-013-566,829
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Lack of spectator participation also was an issue when I assisted to organise an international wheelchair Rugby Fours tournament held at Toa Payoh Sports Hall and the Singapore Cricket Club, which was attended by teams from Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia and Europe. Despite the skilled havoc on the court in play – making for a wonderful spectator experience – we struggled to get more than a handful of spectators to attend the matches in Toa Payoh. This was a point made by Rohit Brijnath, The Straits Times assistant sports editor, who compared this against the 300 to 400 fans who turned up in an earlier leg of the tournament in Palembang. It was a shame, particularly as the Singapore team comprised members with incredible stories that I believe would have been very inspirational to people who actually watched them play. My kids certainly still remember sitting in the stands and watching the matches and talk about it periodically, even today.",18,567,014-002-095-108-013-567,830
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"In view of the above, sports spectatorship should be studied as part of the National Sport Participation Survey (NSPS) and be considered as a key indicator of national development beyond GDP. Apart from the benefits I outlined earlier, exposure to sports, whether as spectators or otherwise, also exposes us to intangible lessons in terms of the culture surrounding various sports, such as the importance of focus and balance in tai chi and yoga, the importance of harmony in aikido, and the respect for the opponents in a sport like kendo, where participants do not celebrate scoring a point out of respect for your opponent who has after all trained as hard as you have.",19,568,014-002-095-108-013-568,831

While I appreciate the need to develop specific hard infrastructure for people with disabilities to participate in some sports, we must put a lot more effort into growing broad, regular participation in sports for them.",20,569,014-002-095-108-013-569,832
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"For instance, the last Enabling Masterplan reported that sports participation rate among persons with disabilities was approximately 50% in 2019, exceeding the target that was set. But the definition of the sports participation rate indicator only tracks whether an individual has participated in any sports or recreational physical activities in the past year. This definition is also different from the one used for the wider population in the National Sport Participation Survey (NSPS), which uses the headline definition of regular participation of at least once a week. It would be good to harmonise the indicators used to better understand where we stand.",21,570,014-002-095-108-013-570,833
2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang),"Secondly, for people with disabilities participating or wanting to participate in sports at a recreational level, our residents share that much of our urban environment continues to present significant barriers to participation. Particularly for running, walking and wheelchair use, cycle and walk paths often do not actually meet the Government's walking and cycling design guide specifications, despite these specifications already making large allowances for our urban density. There often does not seem to have any safe passing distance designed for walking and cycling paths for those with disabilities. For example, intra-town cycling paths can be designed to be just two metres in width. The guidelines also allow for designs encouraging footpath users to enter cycling paths to manoeuvre away from oncoming cyclists or pedestrians in cases where footpaths and cycling paths are next to each other, including in the case of wheelchair users. Running, walking, and wheelchair use are among the most popular and lowest barrier to entry sports for people with disabilities. To get the basic building blocks for disability sports, we must first get everyday active mobility design right.",22,571,014-002-095-108-013-571,834

Many of us in this House lauded the achievements and success of our paralympians, and in particular, our para-equestrian athletes such as Laurentia Tan, who was the first Asian woman to win a Paralympic medal in equestrian sport in Beijing 2008. It is of note that para-equestrian events have its roots in therapy riding. And equine-assisted therapy is widely known to have myriad benefits, ranging from benefiting mental health and well-being, to therapeutic horseback riding, all of which work to build core muscles, balance, confidence, sensory motor skills, and are also extremely calming and relational. And these benefits accrue too to typical and non-disabled individuals.",23,572,014-002-095-108-013-572,835

And I fear that the closure of Singapore Turf Club along with the expiry of leases to stables like the Bukit Timah Saddle Club to make way for residential or transport infrastructure, will only make these sports even more expensive and inaccessible to Singaporeans who could benefit tremendously, particularly as some retired race horses do eventually end up working as therapy horses or for other equestrian-related sports at our dwindling number of saddle clubs.",25,574,014-002-095-108-013-574,837

For example, individuals with sensory sensitivities or on the autism spectrum may find taking part in organised sports difficult to cope with because of the sensory input or unmet expectations, and I hope that parents and officials are given the right awareness and tools to know how best to cope with unexpected situations that arise. This could take the form of training officials and coaches to communicate more effectively with these individuals, to better awareness for parents about which sports may suit their child's specific needs. I also note that exhibits at places like KidsSTOP at the Science Centre have labels that stipulate sensory levels for various exhibits to aid parents to know whether the exhibit is suitable for their child, and perhaps the same system can be applied in the sporting context.",28,577,014-002-095-108-013-577,840

2023-07-06,Sporting Success,014-002-095-108-013,Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong),"But, ultimately, while we have expectations of our athletes' performance, achievements and success, let us also celebrate their journey, their pursuit of excellence, their pushing of boundaries and their maximum potential to become – again, in Mr Darryl David's words – the best version of themselves and let us support them in their downs as much as their ups.

But I know that the NYSI has started engaging our young talents in these sports even before they become part of the Major Games Programmes. For example, as early as in 2017, the NYSI has already started supporting skateboarder Shadiq, who was at that time only 16 years old, by sending him to the UK Talent Inspiration Programme. Today, the Institute has a speed climbing wall which our climbers use regularly to hone their skills. And corporates and Singaporeans at large can also play a part by contributing to the Athletes' Inspire Fund (AIF), to support these athletes to represent Singapore at international competitions.

Tchoukball does have an NSA. It does have an NSA. In fact, the Tchoukball Association of Singapore (TBAS) has been a national federation since 2018. That status was updated this year.

And what struck me about their journey were two things  one, the passion of Delane, his team at the Association, his athletes, and the entire tchoukball community for the sport; two, the strength of the support of corporates and individuals that the Association has been able to galvanise throughout their journey so far.

This means that success and our broader goals as a nation, with regard to sports, must be about how we support every sport and every sportsperson, every athlete, at every step of the journey, whether the sport or sportsperson is emerging, reaching a peak, staying at the peak or indeed, going through the important and necessary valleys and downslopes en route to the peaks.

Inevitably, Government will be the biggest animal in the jungle. But precisely because of this, it behoves the Government to exercise wisdom while playing an active role in the ecosystem, always looking to get things done through partnerships, indeed enabling and empowering and strengthening various partners and stakeholders in the ecosystem and finding different ways to go far together in different sports, including in emerging and niche sports.
