2018-07-11,Wage Growth Moving in Tandem with Productivity Gains,013-002-094-080-001,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the wage growth is moving in tandem with productivity gains; (b) whether the sectoral wage growth is commensurate with sectoral productivity gains; (c) which sectors are productivity laggards; and (d) whether the targeted help provided has led to productivity and wage gains.,1,1,013-002-094-080-001-001,1

2018-07-11,Wage Growth Moving in Tandem with Productivity Gains,013-002-094-080-001,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"  Over the long term, real wage growth should track productivity growth in order to be sustainable. This is because if real wage growth outstrips productivity growth for an extended period, businesses will be at risk of losing their competitiveness and potentially be forced to scale back or close their operations.",1,3,013-002-094-080-001-003,3
2018-07-11,Wage Growth Moving in Tandem with Productivity Gains,013-002-094-080-001,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Over the past two decades, real wages have grown broadly in tandem with productivity at the overall economy level. Specifically, from 2001 to 2017, real wages for resident workers grew by 1.5% per annum on the back of productivity growth of 2.1% per annum.",2,4,013-002-094-080-001-004,4

From 2011 to 2017, real wages for resident workers rose by 1.9% per annum, while productivity grew by only 1.1% per annum over the same period. However, there were differences across sectors.",3,5,013-002-094-080-001-005,5
2018-07-11,Wage Growth Moving in Tandem with Productivity Gains,013-002-094-080-001,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"In particular, domestically-oriented sectors like Construction and Other Services Industries saw real wages rise faster than productivity between 2011 and 2017. This was in part due to labour market tightness, which had led to upward pressures on wages, and also weak or negative productivity growth in these sectors. Meanwhile, even though the sluggish global economic environment had weighed on the productivity performance of outward-oriented sectors over this period, real wage growth in these sectors was generally still supported by positive productivity growth. Indeed, in sectors such as Manufacturing, Wholesale Trade and Finance & Insurance, real wages rose in tandem with productivity on the back of their relatively strong productivity performance. However, in other sectors such as Transportation & Storage and Accommodation, real wage growth exceeded productivity growth.",4,6,013-002-094-080-001-006,6
2018-07-11,Wage Growth Moving in Tandem with Productivity Gains,013-002-094-080-001,The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry),"Against this backdrop, it is crucial that we press on with our productivity drive in order to maintain our competitiveness globally, while enabling continued improvement of Singaporeans' wages and living standards. In this regard, we are taking a targeted, sector-specific approach to raising productivity through the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs). For example, under the Hotel ITM, the Singapore Tourism Board and Singapore Hotel Association have launched the Hotel Innovation Challenge to crowd-source innovative technologies that can improve hotels’ productivity and enhance the guest experience, such as facial recognition check-in.",5,7,013-002-094-080-001-007,7

These schemes have seen some early signs of success. For example, firms that tapped on the Capability Development Grant (CDG) managed by Enterprise Singapore for capability improvement projects between 2005 and 2012 experienced a 9.3% increase in revenue on average over time. Productivity Improvement projects had the largest impact, raising firms' revenue by 12.4%, compared to 7.8% for Technology Innovation projects and an average of 6.7% for the remaining project areas. Similarly, firms that tapped on the SMEs Go Digital programme, formerly known as iSPRINT, for IT solutions to automate their business functions between 2010 and 2013 experienced a 3.1% increase in their revenue on average over time.",6,8,013-002-094-080-001-008,8

For example, NTUC has partnered various companies on measures that raise their productivity and competitiveness. The resultant productivity gains are then shared with the workers in these companies, such as through allowances or payments. As a specific example, the Inclusive Growth Programme (IGP) administered by e2i co-funds companies to embark on productivity improvement projects. The companies are in turn required to share the productivity gains with their workers through a rise in wages.",7,9,013-002-094-080-001-009,9

2018-07-11,Wage Growth Moving in Tandem with Productivity Gains,013-002-094-080-001,Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"  Speaker, I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State for the asnwer. I am glad to know that the real wage growth is 1.9% and productivity growth is 1.1%. So, there is a distinct gap there. I would just like to ask a couple of supplementary questions. First, in terms of MTI, can the Senior Minister of State share a bit more about the productivity or wage growth outlook over the next few years? Yesterday, I had asked about the concerns about interest rates going up over the next year or so, and what it means for wage growth outlook from MTI's perspective. The second question is about concerns on the ground about wage stagnation. As the Senior Minister of State mentioned, the outlook for wage growth is that it is not a broad-based growth. How do you allay some of the wage stagnation concerns for specific sectors? As what the Senior Minister of State had mentioned, some sectors are affected more than others.",1,11,013-002-094-080-001-011,11
2018-07-11,Wage Growth Moving in Tandem with Productivity Gains,013-002-094-080-001,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"  Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his questions. I think the key is that wage growth will not be uniformed across all sectors. Fundamental to driving sustainable wage growth would be to improve productivity. It is one of the important tenets of the ITM that we want to help our companies to better increase productivity by leveraging on technology such that the companies can make better profit margins while controlling their costs from various pressures. An example of how we can help some of these wage gains translate to benefits from the workers' wages would be in programmes like the IGPs, for example.",1,12,013-002-094-080-001-012,12
2018-07-11,Wage Growth Moving in Tandem with Productivity Gains,013-002-094-080-001,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"But importantly, you need to also put in place a lot of framework to help our workers re-skill and upskill themselves so that they themselves can be productive.",2,13,013-002-094-080-001-013,13
2018-07-11,Wage Growth Moving in Tandem with Productivity Gains,013-002-094-080-001,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Several initiatives have already been in play. First, there is a skills framework. Individual workers can leverage on this skills framework to continue to upskill themselves, working with the employers.",3,14,013-002-094-080-001-014,14
2018-07-11,Wage Growth Moving in Tandem with Productivity Gains,013-002-094-080-001,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"The other scheme which the Government has put forth is the WorkPro Job Redesign grant. The grant provides up to 3,000 incentives to help companies create physically easier, safer and smarter jobs, especially for the older workers aged above 50. Because this is the group where there is probably genuine concern about wage stagnation and also job prospects. By using such schemes and grants, we can encourage companies to help level up the workers. And in turn, companies can benefit from having more experienced workers, especially higher productivity ones.",4,15,013-002-094-080-001-015,15
2018-07-11,Wage Growth Moving in Tandem with Productivity Gains,013-002-094-080-001,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"Finally, there is also the scheme called the Progressive Wage Model, especially in certain sectors which are traditionally low-wage. This model is a producticity-based wage progressive pathway that helps to increase the wages of workers through upgrading skills and improving productivity. So far, this has been implemented in three sectors  the cleaning, security and landscape sectors.",5,16,013-002-094-080-001-016,16
2018-07-11,Wage Growth Moving in Tandem with Productivity Gains,013-002-094-080-001,Dr Koh Poh Koon,We do see that there is a need to do more for other sectors. Minister of State for Manpower Sam Tan mentioned during his COS speech this year that MOM is ready to support tripartite partners to develop and adopt progressive wage models voluntarily for other sectors. NTUC has announced recently that the Labour Movement has begun conducting surveys with F&B workers as part of early efforts to see if this can be included in the progressive wage model as well.,6,17,013-002-094-080-001-017,17
2018-07-11,Wage Growth Moving in Tandem with Productivity Gains,013-002-094-080-001,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"So, there are multiple approaches but fundamentally, they all hinge on raising the productivity of our workers.",7,18,013-002-094-080-001-018,18
2018-07-11,Wage Growth Moving in Tandem with Productivity Gains,013-002-094-080-001,Mr Saktiandi Supaat,"  Mr Speaker, I just want to follow up quickly for my question about MTI's real wage growth outlook by sectors. Which sectors does the Senior Minister of State think will be affected most in the next three to five years?",1,19,013-002-094-080-001-019,19
2018-07-11,Wage Growth Moving in Tandem with Productivity Gains,013-002-094-080-001,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"  We do see that certain sectors would have a lot more chances for manpower growth in terms of number of jobs created. The wages in these growth sectors will probably be a lot more competitive as well. One of the sectors that we believe to be a very good, attractive sector that can take in a lot of people with good jobs and good pay would be in the area of the wholesale trade sector, which is very diverse. It includes sectors that deal with commodity trading, but also trading in many other areas. For example, in the logistics sector which is also a key sector in this group.",1,20,013-002-094-080-001-020,20
2018-07-11,Wage Growth Moving in Tandem with Productivity Gains,013-002-094-080-001,Dr Koh Poh Koon,"The other growth sector would be in the manufacturing space; for example, precision engineering, and the semi-conductor industry is still continuing to do well. So, these are the areas in which I think workers would continue to see specific gains.",2,21,013-002-094-080-001-021,21
2018-07-11,Feedback on Short-term Home Rentals and Prior Approval by Property Owners,013-002-094-080-002,Mr Alex Yam,asked the Minister for National Development with the conclusion of public consultation on short-term home rentals (a) what are the main feedback and concerns provided by the public during the consultation exercise; (b) when will new regulations be presented to Parliament for debate; (c) how many illegal rentals have there been so far; and (d) how does the Ministry intend to police the current short-term rental websites before the laws are put in place.,1,1,013-002-094-080-002-001,22
2018-07-11,Feedback on Short-term Home Rentals and Prior Approval by Property Owners,013-002-094-080-002,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked the Minister for National Development in light of concerns from some condominium owners on the further relaxation on short-term leases (a) whether the Ministry will consider getting 100% approval from current property owners in each condominium before short-term lease like Airbnb can be allowed; (b) whether the potential impact of short-term leases on the hospitality industry has been considered; and (c) how is the Ministry dealing with illegal leasing of property currently listed on websites like Airbnb.,1,2,013-002-094-080-002-002,23
2018-07-11,Feedback on Short-term Home Rentals and Prior Approval by Property Owners,013-002-094-080-002,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye,asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many Airbnb cases have been reported in HDB units and private residential units respectively in the past three years; and (b) what is the typical time frame for investigation to complete after a case has been reported.,1,3,013-002-094-080-002-003,24

2018-07-11,Feedback on Short-term Home Rentals and Prior Approval by Property Owners,013-002-094-080-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"  Sir, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) conducted a public consultation exercise on short-term accommodation (STA) from 16 April to 31 May 2018.",1,6,013-002-094-080-002-006,27
2018-07-11,Feedback on Short-term Home Rentals and Prior Approval by Property Owners,013-002-094-080-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Many respondents supported the need for regulations on STA, given that STA can cause negative externalities to other residents. Key concerns raised include safety, security and privacy, as well as abuse of common property. Many also supported regulating STA platform operators, for example, through a licensing framework.",2,7,013-002-094-080-002-007,28
2018-07-11,Feedback on Short-term Home Rentals and Prior Approval by Property Owners,013-002-094-080-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,One of the proposals was to require the Management Corporation of a strata-titled residential development to obtain the support of at least 80% of the share value in the development before STA can be permitted in any residential unit. The intent is to give home-owners a say in whether or not to allow STA in their development.,3,8,013-002-094-080-002-008,29
2018-07-11,Feedback on Short-term Home Rentals and Prior Approval by Property Owners,013-002-094-080-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"There was mixed response to this proposal. Some respondents felt that an 80% threshold would be unfair to the minority who do not support STA, but have to accept the presence of STA guests in their developments. On the other hand, there were some who felt that an 80% threshold was too high, and that it would be difficult to obtain sufficient votes in support of STA among home-owners. So, URA is carefully studying all the feedback that we have received and we will do so before deciding on how to take this issue forward, including how to structure the final regulatory approach and whether there is a need for any legislative amendments.",4,9,013-002-094-080-002-009,30
2018-07-11,Feedback on Short-term Home Rentals and Prior Approval by Property Owners,013-002-094-080-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked about the impact of legalising STA on the hospitality industry. In fact, indeed, something we had considered very carefully. The proposed regulatory framework for STA includes controls which are similar to those imposed on the hospitality industry. For example, under our proposed safeguards, STA hosts must collect and record the personal details of their guests, and comply with fire safety regulations like the provision of fire extinguishers in their units. We have also proposed licensing platform operators, so that they can also help to ensure that STA activities do not cause problems for other residents. So, the intent is to provide a more level playing field between the STA sector and the hospitality industry.",5,10,013-002-094-080-002-010,31
2018-07-11,Feedback on Short-term Home Rentals and Prior Approval by Property Owners,013-002-094-080-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"As I have mentioned, these are proposals that we had put out; we have done one round of consultation, received feedback, there are mixed views. So, URA is studying the matter very carefully to see what is the best way forward. Even as we do so, even as we consider the deliberations very carefully, I would emphasise that the minimum stay duration of three consecutive months for private residential properties still applies. URA will take enforcement action against those who breach this rule.",6,11,013-002-094-080-002-011,32
2018-07-11,Feedback on Short-term Home Rentals and Prior Approval by Property Owners,013-002-094-080-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"Mr Alex Yam and Mr Melvin Yong asked about the number of such cases. From 2015 to 2017, URA received 1,808 reports of unauthorised STA in private residential units. In the same period, HDB received 390 reports of STA in HDB flats.",7,12,013-002-094-080-002-012,33
2018-07-11,Feedback on Short-term Home Rentals and Prior Approval by Property Owners,013-002-094-080-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"The time taken by URA and HDB to investigate a report of unauthorised STA depends on the circumstances of each case. Conducting ground inspections and interviews to obtain evidence of an offence can take up to several months, in some instances. However, if the party making the report is able to provide details and documentary evidence of the suspected offence, investigations can be completed more expeditiously.",8,13,013-002-094-080-002-013,34
2018-07-11,Feedback on Short-term Home Rentals and Prior Approval by Property Owners,013-002-094-080-002,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"  Speaker, Sir, I have four supplementary questions. The impact on the hospitality sector that I am looking at is, with the liberalisation of short-term lease, do you think that it is unfair to those who had invested in the hospitality sector? They would have invested in the setting up, for example, of hotels and so on. The second question is, why is it 80%? Condominium owners, a lot of them who buy and want to stay in these units themselves, they will be adversely affected. I would think that for existing condominiums, it should be 100%. The third question, a lot of the residents think that if we allow short-term lease, it would drive up the rental costs and hence, it would have chain-effect and drive up the cost of living. So, what is MND's take on this? And last, if we allow short-term lease, it would make investment in a property look more attractive and the returns more attractive and hence, it would drive up the property prices. On one hand, you have just implemented a round of cooling measures that is very unpopular; and on the other hand, you wish to liberalise the short-term lease.",1,14,013-002-094-080-002-014,35
2018-07-11,Feedback on Short-term Home Rentals and Prior Approval by Property Owners,013-002-094-080-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"  Mr Speaker, I will take the questions in turn. On the first point on the hospitality sector, our approach to this has to be one that is based on fair competition. It is not possible to say, ""Let's block any new entrants into the hospitality sector"", simply on the basis that the existing incumbents have put in investments. This is an open market; new entrants can come in but the regulations must be fair and the industry must be regulated on a level playing field. That is the intent of what we have proposed.",1,15,013-002-094-080-002-015,36
2018-07-11,Feedback on Short-term Home Rentals and Prior Approval by Property Owners,013-002-094-080-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the thresholds, as I have said, there were mixed views from the consultations, so, we are going to review what is the right way forward and what is the best way to ensure that all property owners do have a say in deciding on the appropriate use of their development.",2,16,013-002-094-080-002-016,37
2018-07-11,Feedback on Short-term Home Rentals and Prior Approval by Property Owners,013-002-094-080-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"On the impact on rental and the property market, the Member's views are well-taken. We have seen this and we have studied this phenomenon in other property markets as well, where indeed, short-term accommodations have put upward pressure on rentals and on property prices. We are mindful that this may have an impact and that is why, as I have said earlier, we are not rushing to make changes. We are studying the matter very carefully. If and when we choose to do so, we will make sure that there are indeed appropriate safeguards.",3,17,013-002-094-080-002-017,38

2018-07-11,Feedback on Short-term Home Rentals and Prior Approval by Property Owners,013-002-094-080-002,Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee),"  Mr Speaker, just two clarifications to seek from the Minister. The hon Member Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and I had raised the question on short-term lease websites that are currently operating  are there any plans to police them, or to regulate them before the new regulations come into place? The second, as the Minister mentioned earlier, the number of cases under URA and HDB, they come close to a total of about 2,200 cases. Of these reports, how many have actually proceeded to prosecution?",1,19,013-002-094-080-002-019,40
2018-07-11,Feedback on Short-term Home Rentals and Prior Approval by Property Owners,013-002-094-080-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"  Mr Speaker, on the websites, and the ads that you see on the websites by STA operators, these, in and of themselves, do not necessarily contravene the rules because it is a posting of a place that is available for rental. They do not indicate time frame. The postings themselves may not necessarily contravene the rules, and even if we were to block the websites, I am sure there will be different ways in which these advertisements can be put up. So, I think the key is not so much the postings or the websites, but the actual activities, the STA activities that are undertaken. And if URA knows of any such activities, they will take follow-up action, and enforcement action.",1,20,013-002-094-080-002-020,41
2018-07-11,Feedback on Short-term Home Rentals and Prior Approval by Property Owners,013-002-094-080-002,Mr Lawrence Wong,"I mentioned a number of cases – for all of them, enforcement notices will be issued. A good majority of them will then stop and immediately comply with the enforcement notice. But should there be cases that continue or there are egregious cases, then indeed URA will work with AGC on prosecution. There has already been one, and we will see if there are others, if they were to come in the subsequent months.",2,21,013-002-094-080-002-021,42

In fact, I think out of the 1,000-over cases, a significant number will be from my constituency. I just did a quick check at one of the websites  I tried to put a five-day request, and it turns out that there are 196 listings just within a small area in Novena and Orchard.",1,22,013-002-094-080-002-022,43
2018-07-11,Feedback on Short-term Home Rentals and Prior Approval by Property Owners,013-002-094-080-002,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar),"I think a common complaint from my residents is that URA is indeed taking too long to investigate the complaints and to take enforcement actions to stop the illegal short-term home rentals. Residents cannot quite understand why it is taking so long because they have pictures of people coming in buses and in Grab cars every two, three days. In fact, during my house visits, they can even tell me which are the units. When I go and knock on the doors, yes, indeed, sometimes, different residents come to talk to me. So, to them, I think the evidence is quite clear, and perhaps the investigations and enforcement action can be more expedient. I hope the Minister can clarify on this.",2,23,013-002-094-080-002-023,44

2018-07-11,Young People who Leave Education System after Major Examinations,013-002-094-080-003,The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung),"  Over the years, MOE has implemented many measures to reduce dropouts post-PSLE. These include different education streams to cater to students with different pace of learning at that age, early interventions at lower Primary to help students keep up, and specialised schools, namely Northlight School and Assumption Pathway School to cater to students who did not qualify for Secondary school courses after PSLE.

I just have one supplementary question. Because there is now a nationwide SkillsFuture framework in place that provides for comprehensive and continuous education, dropouts might feel that they have no stakeholding in this framework, mainly because they have been kind of labelled as ""failures"", and are not seen as learners anymore. They might be considered as discouraged learners, so to speak. Is there any scope or any specific programmes within SkillsFuture that can reach out to these groups?",1,7,013-002-094-080-003-007,52

Just two supplementary questions. Firstly, would the Senior Parliamentary Secretary acknowledge that there are risks in the voluntary notification system vis a vis a mandatory one, in the sense, that if a merger or an acquisition is found to be illegal after the fact, there could be costs borne by employees, customers and even the wider society for that merger or acquisition to be unwound or to be mitigated after the fact. For example, employees could be let go, brands could be dissolved or removed, products could be withdrawn. It may be very difficult, if not impossible to make restitution for all those events after the fact.",1,7,013-002-094-080-005-007,66

It is not my intention to talk about the specific case I know of that is on-going, but I am really just querying the general principle. How do we manage those downside costs and risks? Particularly, in light of the fact that while there are some jurisdictions that have voluntary notification, the US and the EU, I believe, have mandatory notification beyond certain thresholds. The US has the Hart-Scott-Rodino pre-merger notification requirement, above the threshold about $76 million, which is reviewed regularly and inflation —",2,8,013-002-094-080-005-008,67

The second question that I have, it is in regards to compliance cost. I do recognise what the Senior Parliamentary Secretary said that compliance cost, that we do not want to ""over egg the pudding"" and increase compliance cost unnecessarily. But would that not really go to the question of thresholds? You can set a dollar threshold and the market share change threshold high enough so that the vast majority of M&A would not be affected. So, the question of compliance cost – could it not be addressed through a mandatory notification regime, which has sufficiently high thresholds?",1,11,013-002-094-080-005-011,70

He is basically asking will a mandatory notification system be able to address situations where the prospective merging parties, for whatever reasons, do not make known the merger in advance. Now, we have mentioned that Singapore's voluntary notification regime is similar to that in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. And indeed, there are other jurisdictions that have a mandatory merger notification regime, such as the EU, Vietnam, Philippines and the United States; which include the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, which the Member has raised. But even in these jurisdictions where there is mandatory notification, the same situation can arise where companies that are determined to implement an anti-competitive merger still choose to go ahead without notifying the competition authorities. So, in summary, it is important, generally speaking, that any competition commissioned has the ability to address unnotified mergers that are found or determent to be anti-competitive. And our regime which follows elements from other jurisdictions, addresses that.",1,12,013-002-094-080-005-012,71

I have two clarifications. I understand that the shared care and control is actually a Court ruling so that the children following a divorce will be able to live with both parties.

They also said they had removed the time bar in the best interest of the children involved in the divorce. But now that we are back to the ex-spousal consent on who can list the children as occupiers, are we not back to square one again?

2018-07-11,Eligibility Conditions for Divorcees with Shared Care of Children to Purchase Subsidised HDB Flats,013-002-094-080-006,Ms Sun Xueling,"  I thank the Member for his question. Now, time bar aside, divorced couples with shared care and control of their child, as I have mentioned, are still required to obtain their ex-spouse's written agreement before they apply for a flat. This is because both parents have equal rights to buy a flat with their child, and HDB is not in a position to determine which parent should exercise the right. This is also to be consistent and fair to all HDB flat owners and households, where each person can only be listed in one HDB flat. But for those who face challenges in reaching an agreement, HDB will exercise flexibility, if they face financial difficulties or lack family support.

This becomes an issue of contention because they have difficulties arranging for their housing later, especially in shared care and control arrangements.

They have fill it up and sign it. From my experience and from anecdotal evidence given by clients who have gone through the process, depending on the officer, the advice given may not necessarily be as thorough and helpful. So, I believe that in circumstances where there is a divorce, it would be helpful if parties are given a very clear outcome, a very clear option that is available to them, especially at that stage before they actually go through the whole divorce process so that they can see how much loan they can actually take out, how much monies they have, what are their options. They have all these in broad terms but it does not really help because they just give rough figures, or sometimes to an extent that they would not even the indication of the housing loan eligibility because they do not have the divorce order yet.

Does the Ministry work together with the Family Courts in terms of coming to a mutual set of guidelines? Because in recent months, there have been more cases of shared care and control that I have seen, and we also have cases that we have come across with limited tenure shared care and control. For example, a resident of mine was given shared care and control of the children with her spouse for only 10 months, and she was told by the courts that she needs to resolve her housing situation within these 10 months. This was quite a distinct from all the other judgments, in terms of divorce cases that I have seen in the last decade or so. So, does the Ministry work closely with the Family Courts in terms of advising and coming up with these guidelines, so that you do not have situations where the couple and the children end up suffering?",1,16,013-002-094-080-006-016,87

I would first like to add that in terms of numbers, as of 2016, shared care and control constitute 4% of all divorce care and control Orders, so the numbers speak for themselves. As to his point, about whether or not we work closely with Family Courts, I think we have to make decisions independently, somewhat. We cannot be influencing the Court's decisions.

Can I suggest that at least we waive this ex-spousal consent, for children to be listed as occupiers, if the other party has moved on. Following the divorce, they now own a private property or they own a subsidised housing, which means that they have re-married. Can the ex-spousal consent then be waived for the other party?

For higher education, there is significant subsidies at all levels. Specifically, ITE course fees are funded at over 90% subsidy. In addition, the Government provides a range of financial assistance schemes (FAS) for students who need further assistance.",1,2,013-002-094-080-007-002,92

In Academic Year 2016, over 70% of students at ITE received some form of financial aid or scholarships, such as the CDC/CCC Bursary and the MOE Bursary. There are also merit-based scholarships that similarly defray students' fees and school-related expenses, as well as other financial assistance schemes offered by foundations, Self-Help Groups, and other community or private organisations.",2,3,013-002-094-080-007-003,93

These efforts include (i) sharing information on FAS widely via ITE's website, Facebook, student handbook, student portals and through booths and briefings during orientation; (ii) proactively reaching out to students who were previously on FAS in Secondary school, and those who had indicated potential of requiring assistance, and prompting them to apply for FAS.

I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the answers. I have two supplementary questions for him. The first question is  in terms of the numbers that he shared, 90% of subsidies given out to students in ITE, what percentiles are we targeting here in terms of the income levels? The second question is  what more can we do potentially for the ITE students who need help? The Senior Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that Ministry briefs those Secondary schools earlier for those going into ITE. And what more can we do to help? Going forward, how are we going to communicate more to the students? For example, in Toa Payoh East-Novena, for example, I do see repeatedly some students and their parents coming to see me, not being aware of some of the assistance that are available to them in school, including the ECG and also in terms of other financial assistance that they may need help from.",1,5,013-002-094-080-007-005,95

I mentioned in my speech earlier that over 70% of the students receive some form of financial help and this is different from the 90% subsidy that we give to ITE students. So, 70% is very close to our intended coverage of Government bursaries for Singapore citizens where we would like to cover up to 66 percentile of the household by income.

One good example of how we are going to streamline is that we have this MOE ComCare Shared Assessment where the students in ITE whose families are already on ComCare assistance, when they are being assessed for ComCare assistance, we will also look at the eligibility of the students for Government bursaries at ITE, so that they do not have to fill up the form twice or take up the approach again. So, in this way, we will be able to streamline it, make it easier for them. This is expected to take place or to start second half of this year.",2,7,013-002-094-080-007-007,97

Two questions. The first one is regarding the AIC's centralised transport service. In your view, is there any supply crunch right now in providing the specialised vans, and going into the future where there is an extension of the eldercare centres? The second question is with regard to the collaboration between AIC and the taxi operators and the private hire companies. Is the scope of the collaboration beyond just in terms of teaching the drivers how to handle wheelchair-bound commuters? Is it more than just that in terms of expanding the fleet, for example, into specialised vans and more direct kind of collaboration between homes and the companies?",1,5,013-002-094-080-008-005,102

Based on our landscape scan, there are multiple transport options for centres which I have already elaborated during my PQ reply, and that is assessed to be able to provide adequate transport capacity to meet our current demand. We have continually grown the capacity of specialised vans to meet the demand over the years. Even if the demand increases, centres can activate committed capacity under the AIC centralised transport service or other specialised transport operators or use private hire cars such as GrabAssist and taxis as an interim approach.",1,6,013-002-094-080-008-006,103

I have two supplementary questions. First, earlier this year, MOH released an update that two in three new cases reported last year in 2017 were aged 50 and above, and up to 30% of older residents in Singapore have latent TB. From the Senior Minister of State's earlier reply, about 10% of those with latent TB can possibly develop the active form. My first question is  with an ageing population, will the number of patients with active TB continue to increase further, with the growing numbers? If so, are there plans to have more targeted public education, public awareness, for this group of older Singaporeans to maybe get them more aware about what signs to look out for, what precautions to take?

Mr Melvin Yong is right to say that the prevalence of latent TB amongst the elderly Singaporeans is quite high, in the region of about 30%. The reason for that is because TB was endemic in Singapore and was very common until the 1970s. As a result, it is not unexpected to see the prevalence of latent TB to be higher within the older age group.",1,13,013-002-094-080-009-013,118

2018-07-11,Update on Whether ERP is Required to Manage Traffic Congestion,013-002-094-080-011,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah,asked the Minister for Transport if he will provide an update on whether evening ERP is still required to manage traffic congestion along the CTE.,1,1,013-002-094-080-011-001,132
2018-07-11,Update on Whether ERP is Required to Manage Traffic Congestion,013-002-094-080-011,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr Baey Yam Keng) (for the Minister for Transport),"  Mr Speaker, Sir, the Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) policy helps to manage traffic congestion and maintain optimal traffic speeds. Currently, evening ERP is only imposed along the northbound Central Expressway (CTE), where traffic speeds range between 48 km/h and 56 km/h. This is near the lower bound of the optimal expressway speeds. Evening ERP is, therefore, still required there to prevent further congestion. LTA will continue to monitor the situation and review the ERP charges where necessary.",1,2,013-002-094-080-011-002,133
2018-07-11,Update on Whether ERP is Required to Manage Traffic Congestion,013-002-094-080-011,Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon),"  Sir, I have one supplementary question. I find that this is very unfair to those residents who are living in the north. They have to pay ERP in the morning and ERP in the evening. Many residents can understand the need for having ERP in the morning. But many feel that the evening one is not acceptable and they feel that speed is not critical when they are going home. So, I would like to ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary whether MOT can review the purpose of the ERP and see how effective it is in mitigating the traffic jam.",1,3,013-002-094-080-011-003,134
2018-07-11,Update on Whether ERP is Required to Manage Traffic Congestion,013-002-094-080-011,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"  Mr Speaker, Sir, Er Dr Lee had asked the same question in January 2016. However, over the last two and a half years, the journey speeds on the north-bound CTE in the evening have not changed much. It has not become much worse, nor has it improved significantly. While I agree with Er Dr Lee that, to some people, going home in the evening is not so critical and maybe we should not need the ERP, but I think with the aspiration for better work-life balance, family time is important to many people nowadays. So, for the tens and thousands of motorists who are enjoying lighter traffic and higher speeds when they travel along CTE in the evening, they have been able to reach home quicker, in time for dinner and to spend quality time with their families. So, I am not sure whether they will share the same views. Speed will affect the time required for the journeys.",1,4,013-002-094-080-011-004,135
2018-07-11,Update on Whether ERP is Required to Manage Traffic Congestion,013-002-094-080-011,Mr Baey Yam Keng,"LTA's main mandate is to ensure that motorists are able to enjoy smooth and safe journeys on the roads and expressways. Without the ERP, all motorists on the north-bound CTE are more likely to experience jams in the evening. This is expected, as our northern areas are more densely populated, which includes Nee Soon South, where the Member's constituency is. But with ERP, it alleviates this traffic congestion. We have data to show that, with ERP or when ERP rates are adjusted accordingly, it does shape motorists' behaviour and it alleviates the situation and, at the same time, provides options for commuters. So, those who are willing to pay the ERP charges can enjoy a shorter journey home while others can choose other routes. For example, going up north, they can choose Thomson Road which is not a priced road, or they can take public transport. In addition, my Ministry has been working very hard to improve these other options. For example, we are constructing the North-South Corridor, and the MRT re-signalling works will help to increase train frequencies.

But, if I just use the example for the north-bound traffic along CTE after PIE, in the third quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, we did raise the ERP charges because we observed that traffic has come down below the optimum range of 45 km/h, way below 45 km/h. When the ERP rates were adjusted, it did help to lessen the traffic and the speeds went up. So, with that, motorists have been able to reach home faster and we see a direct impact on the motorists' behaviour with the pricing policy.",1,7,013-002-094-080-011-007,138

The vehicle must pass a safety assessment to demonstrate that it can adequately handle basic manoeuvres and come to a safe stop upon the detection of an obstacle. Initial AV trials will only be conducted on lightly used roads, such as those in the one-north district. Further trials in more complex environments will be allowed when AVs are able to demonstrate a higher level of competence. All AVs being tested must be accompanied by a safety driver trained to immediately take over full control of the AV when required. All AVs must have a vehicle fault alert system that will alert the safety driver of any faults, and allow the control of the vehicle to be immediately transferred to the safety driver.

News reports stated that the car was in autonomous mode and there was a legal operator inside the car at the time of the accident. This threw in doubt the safety measures that most companies have already put into the development of the car. So, given that we have plans to roll out self-driving vehicles, buses, on our public roads in the near future – I think reports have been made – how can we determine whether a particular self-driving vehicle model is safe before we put it onto the road?

Absolute safety is very hard to determine in any situation or any technology. And the reality is that human-piloted vehicles are not absolutely safe and we do see a significant number of accidents.

Why would those blocks that cannot get LUP because of funding cap, why in the first place the Ministry did not put them under the main LUP contract because they will enjoy huge economies of scale when it comes to bidding? Some contractors are like that. If I build one lift, it is more expensive, I do not mind throwing in a few other freebies. I think if the whole thing were to be parked under the original LUP, I think those blocks which have funding cap issues, will probably be resolved. I do not know whether the Ministry could consider throwing another tender for all these lifts?",1,7,013-002-094-080-016-007,177

Some of the 150 blocks are not eligible for LUP because of very severe site constraints. Part of it is technical, part of it is just the way in which the block is designed in relation to the land surrounding. But for those blocks that are not eligible because of cost considerations. They are well in excess of $100,000 per unit. So, even if you drive this as a part of the overall LUP, which they were, because LUP when you call the contract, it is for all unavailable blocks that qualify. The nature of these remaining number of blocks, the cost would be way in excess of $100,000. So, that is a very different order altogether.",1,8,013-002-094-080-016-008,178

They extol quick solutions, and well-to-do parents will fork out the cash for these quick solutions.

Mr Kumaran Veera is the Head of Department at Concord Primary School in Chua Chu Kang. He teaches Primary 5 and Primary 6 students.

Kumaran's stories are not of children who are bored in class because of too much tuition. They are stories of bright girls and boys who sit at the back of class, and sometimes do not even come to school because parents do not encourage them to turn up at school. Stories of him and others visiting the houses of such students and using tough love, Mr Speaker, to encourage these students to attend school, and tough love on the parents as well to send them to school.

It is named after a road which is based in Bukit Batok right now. It used to be Hillview, but now it is Bukit Batok. After the PSLE, I was fortunate to get a place in Raffles Institution (RI).

That saddened me. And I am happy to report that after speaking to Vice Principals and teachers at RI, they have tried to take some swift action to combat this perception. RI has established a scholarship and mentorship programme for Primary 5 and Primary 6 students from across the country. I spoke to Mrs Theresa Lai,va Vice Principal, who hopes that through this mentorship and scholarship programmes, RI can play a part in the social mobility of these students with both financial support, but also through ""old school"", ""older brother/older sister"" mentorship, where you have Secondary 1 and Secondary 2 students actually going to meet their counterparts, or their juniors, in Primary school to encourage them. Although the mentors provide academic support, the larger idea is to work with these nine- and 10-year-olds in Primary school to deal with the socio-emotional stresses and what leadership skills actually involve.",37,37,013-002-094-080-017-037,216

2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to firstly declare that I am a parent of a child with Down's Syndrome. My son Ayden, is therefore, by common definition, a child with special needs. The first few months of Ayden's life was probably the most challenging period in my life. Down's Syndrome children typically have certain associated medical conditions. So, at the beginning, I was at KKH almost every other week for a slew of medical appointments. Other parents, whose children have special needs, would probably share similar experiences.",1,51,013-002-094-080-017-051,230

It is not uncommon to hear this – and I believe the hon Member Ms Denise Phua would have shared this – that these parents often say that they would rather live to see their child die so that they could ensure that the child's needs are met to the end. It is heart-breaking to hear.",2,52,013-002-094-080-017-052,231
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"This worry is not unjustified. A quick sensing of the current environment suggests that society, whilst now more open and accepting of people with special needs, is still not completely comfortable with them. The National Council of Social Service (NCSS) conducted an attitude study with 1,400 citizens and permanent residents in 2015 and found that the public viewed persons with disabilities less favourably than those without a disability. They also had less favourable attitudes towards those with intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorder. The Lien Foundation's Inclusive Attitudes Study conducted in 2016 echoed this finding. Half of the parents they polled indicated that they were uncomfortable about their child having to sit next to one with special needs in class.",3,53,013-002-094-080-017-053,232

The man said that his wife is a teacher and that there is a child with special needs in her class. His wife must have shared her challenges with him. He said that he was of the view that ""these children"" should not be put in the same class as normal children. They are disruptive and cause a lot of problems to the teachers and the class. He felt that parents of children with special needs are in denial and they want to believe that their children are normal, so they insist that their children be in mainstream schools when they actually should be taught elsewhere.",5,55,013-002-094-080-017-055,234
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Honestly, I understood where this gentleman was coming from. The challenges faced by teachers in such settings are real. We need to deal with these challenges. I will touch on this a little later in my speech. But the caller's solution to the problem, offended and hurt me as a parent. His tone and the curt manner in which he declared his views, reflected how he felt about children who are different. They should be taught separately, kept apart from normal children. I appreciate it may not be completely fair to postulate from his brief remarks what he thought of people with special needs in general. To me though, it felt like a rejection, that children like Ayden will always be seen as a burden, that they should be put in appropriate places. I cried my eyes out that afternoon.",6,56,013-002-094-080-017-056,235
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"So, what does all this have to do with the Motion today? Why am I telling you these stories? There are many different aspects of the Motion that we can debate about today but I would like to speak about inclusive education from the perspective of persons with special needs. The reality is, whilst Singapore has made great strides in encouraging and promoting inclusiveness within our community, we have some way to go in truly walking the talk. Our society is still not yet able to truly view persons with disabilities as an equally valued member of the community. And I believe that we can review and build our education system so as to change perceptions, normalise disabilities; so that people can appreciate that persons with special needs are simply differently abled and are of no lesser value than any other member of society.",7,57,013-002-094-080-017-057,236
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Singapore has done a lot towards building an inclusive society. The Government started the journey in 2007 when the First Enabling Masterplan (EM1) was drafted and adopted. EM1 outlined a vision where persons with disabilities are fully integrated, empowered to reach their potential and are contributing members of society. A decade later, the Third Enabling Masterplan had been drafted and is currently being implemented.",8,58,013-002-094-080-017-058,237
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"However, there are still gaps and areas which we can give more attention to, so as to truly embrace people with different abilities and give them the opportunity and motivation to excel. I would like to say at this juncture that this is not about seeking special treatment. A pragmatist may also say that it would be unreasonable to expect the Government to put in large resources and funding to address needs of only a small percentage of people in the community. But I trust one can agree that enhancing inclusiveness within our education system will bring great benefit to Singapore as a whole.",9,59,013-002-094-080-017-059,238
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Firstly, fully embracing people with special needs within our community creates opportunities for people to be more caring and compassionate. I recall a conversation I had with you, Mr Speaker, when you were then the Minister for Social and Family Development. You feel strongly that people with special needs have a role to play in helping build kindness and empathy in the community. They are conduits through which we can elevate the level of compassion amongst Singaporeans. I fully agree.",10,60,013-002-094-080-017-060,239
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Research shows that a genuinely inclusive education system allows children to build and develop friendships that they might not have encountered otherwise, as inclusive settings encourage higher levels of interaction than segregated settings. What results is better outcomes for social and communication development, and an early inculcation of values of inclusion. Such early exposure benefit both children with and without special needs, where they will be better able to demonstrate greater compassion, empathy, and have better understanding on how to interact with their peers and accept diversity. These children could develop better interpersonal skills and exhibit greater adaptability.",11,61,013-002-094-080-017-061,240
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"These results could already be seen at Kindle Garden, a pre-school by AWWA – Singapore's first inclusive pre-school. At Kindle Garden, children with different needs and different backgrounds study together. Learning is personalised and children are taught to embrace diversity and respect for each other. I accept that the model is not necessarily easy to replicate, but for now, let us focus on the results that could be achieved if we truly set out to be inclusive.",12,62,013-002-094-080-017-062,241
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Secondly, there is great future economic value in equipping our special needs children with the necessary skills so that they could be independent. Research shows that when children with special needs are being supported to communicate with their peers, they enhance their independent communication, mastery of augmentative and alternative communication strategies and have increased speech and language development. If we intervene early, in schools, we give them the necessary skills and prepare them for the future, there is a greater chance that they would graduate school and join the workforce. If they can work well, be independent and contribute meaningfully towards the economy, less resources need to be spent on support structures or schemes when they are adults.",13,63,013-002-094-080-017-063,242
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"In light of the above, I make the following recommendations to enhance the education landscape.",14,64,013-002-094-080-017-064,243
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"For one, we should have an integrated education system and school setting. A common misunderstanding of an inclusive education is one where there is simply a presence of students with disabilities in a classroom or school setting but where micro or macro exclusion still occurs. If there is segregation and the children are not treated equally within the same setting, that is not truly inclusive education.",15,65,013-002-094-080-017-065,244
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"In 2012, the Ministry of Education announced that 20 Special Education (SPED) Schools will be paired with mainstream schools so that students from both schools have the opportunities to mingle, for example, during recess and at school events. I understand that there are also lessons in Character and Citizenship Education in mainstream schools that help raise awareness of disabilities and how each person can play a part in developing an inclusive society. Schools have also forged partnership with VWOs to provide opportunities for students to interact meaningfully and deepen mutual understanding. These are all great efforts but we need to build on them.",16,66,013-002-094-080-017-066,245
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"So, we should have an education system where children with and without special needs learn and play within the same setting but in different pathways. I believe that this is more accurately described as an integrated education system. That way, students can receive different support and assistance based on their needs but yet have the opportunity to interact meaningfully.",17,67,013-002-094-080-017-067,246
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Currently, there are special needs students in mainstream schools. However, such arrangements in some situations, have been challenging for the teachers as well as the students (those with and without special needs). We hear many instances where the teachers and the allied educators, cannot manage the students and the class situation. Teachers get stressed, the students in class are affected, parents chime in and express their unhappiness about the arrangements and everyone is discouraged by the efforts to be inclusive. So, to do this properly, we need to build the proper support structure and have sufficient resources.",18,68,013-002-094-080-017-068,247
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"One key resource is the group of teachers who are trained to teach students with special needs. It appears that there is currently a shortage of such teachers. While there is a growing pool of allied educators specialising in learning and behavioural support and a large number of teachers trained to meet special needs in mainstream schools, teachers have been reported to be shorthanded in managing students requiring additional learning support. In addition, we have also seen reports in the papers about the Lien Foundation survey which alluded to a high burn-out rate of professionals working with special needs children. Fifty-one percent of the 423 professionals surveyed felt that burning out quickly was one of the key challenges they faced. Forty-four percent said salaries and benefits were unattractive while 34% pointed to manpower shortage as a challenge.",19,69,013-002-094-080-017-069,248
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"We, therefore, secondly, need to improve the profession and career pathway of special education teachers. Currently, these teachers are hired by various social service organisations who are guided by the salary scale recommended by NCSS. The general perception is that these teachers receive less recognition and their pay packages are less attractive than their counterparts in mainstream education.",20,70,013-002-094-080-017-070,249
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"I propose that these teachers come under the purview of the MOE like their peers in mainstream schools so that they would have access to the same salary scales, as well as career opportunities, which would in turn raise the stature and attractiveness of the role and encourage more to pursue a career in this profession. Having more educators trained in supporting special needs would better support the learning needs of our children and ensure that they can achieve their fullest potential. These teachers can be tapped on to support students in mainstream or SPED schools.",21,71,013-002-094-080-017-071,250
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"In the same vein of building resources, I would make a third recommendation that we also build synergy between the education and health sectors, so as to ensure that access to the necessary assessments is enhanced. Early identification of learning difficulties can help ensure that students who have such needs receive the necessary support as soon as possible. However, parents often cite long waiting lists for MOE psychologists when seeking to have their children assessed. Taking a leave from the GEP-Partnership Programme in the mental health sector, I propose an MOE Psychologist Partnership Programme where several recognised private psychologists can provide assessments for learning difficulties. To address high costs, the identified practitioners could provide subsidies to families with CHAS cards, with part of the costs subsidised by the Government.",22,72,013-002-094-080-017-072,251
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong),"Lastly, I propose a review of the administration of school curriculum for both mainstream and SPED schools. Our children are all unique, with different talents and abilities. Often in the school system, we are pushing them into categories or groups, which allows for a more expedient delivery of information and knowledge. However, this means that we may not be fully developing their strengths and addressing their weaknesses. For example, at the moment, children with special needs in mainstream schools are still expected to complete the same curriculum as their peers. Support is given when their natural abilities fall short of what is required. But if we are really serious in allowing each child to flourish, there may be value in adjusting a curriculum according to each individual’s needs, pace of learning, as well as providing the facilities and resources required to cater to the wide spectrum of disabilities.",23,73,013-002-094-080-017-073,252

But by the end of that same year, the group ballooned into 100 kids and we realised we should officially register as a private tuition centre. So, we applied to the Registry of Business (RCB) calling ourselves School of Thought and soon after, an RCB officer called me back to tell us our name could not be approved. I asked him what was wrong with the name School of Thought. And for as long as I teach, I do not think I will forget what he said.

One medical team shared with us their conviction to put more emphasis on empathy in their curriculum came after a disillusioned medical student revealed to them that she was quitting the profession after she witnessed two surgeons she was supposed to be learning from, execute a surgical procedure with flawless expertise, while simultaneously making the most vile and derogatory comments about the unconscious patient.

It is hardly a silver bullet solution and abolishing it will definitely generate many new problems and fail to resolve some old ones. It will force many other policies to change together with it. However, I also see that the ground does not seem sufficiently convinced so far by the little tweaks being made to PSLE grades. We know this because they are not changing their behaviour in any significant way. Mothers are still quitting their jobs to prepare their kids for PSLE. The billion-dollar tuition industry is still not pivoting their business models to help kids grow in character rather than in grades any time soon.

I can understand the Government's resistance to abolishing PSLE because to take on the barrage of trouble involved, the win must be significant and something the majority of the electorate must show that it is willing to support. Because abolishing PSLE will set off a chain reaction of very uncomfortable changes. Without PSLE, there might be much less reason to stream in Primary school or upon entering Secondary school. Primary school teachers will be challenged to up their game and compelled to design and deliver a curriculum that is no longer about preparing kids for a standardised exam.

So, this is all easy for me to say because I am not a politician and I am just speaking as a parent. This particular parent's naive hope is that we will someday dismantle the PSLE because I would rather give more time and space for our teachers to develop our children's thinking without fear of messing up a high-stakes exam. Moreover, I think a 16-year-old is far more cognitively prepared to deal with the psychological impact of a high-stakes exam than a 12-year-old.

Every parent in this room also knows there is a huge difference when children grow up in a literacy-rich environment. That is why we buy books for our kids though we also have access to public libraries. So, we allow these kids to initiate the request for their own mini-library and own their own customised cargo of books. They might be far more likely to see books as part of their life. If the Media Development Authority can consider working with these successful ground-up literacy movements to co-create a solution using media or technology that could help sustain their impact, that would be great because kids need plenty of repetition and audio-visual recordings of these books for them to playback on their own time might prove really helpful.",45,140,013-002-094-080-017-140,319

That is to say, one learns to analyse the problem, then suggest solutions, before evaluating its results. There is also an emphasis on dialogic learning. Allow me to quote Paulo Freire, the pedagogue who advocated Problem Posing approach, dialogic learning and critical pedagogy. To him, dialogue ""cannot exist without the profound love for the world"", and Problems Posing Education ""affirms men and women as being in the process of becoming"".",18,204,013-002-094-080-017-204,383

I would not want to talk about classroom sizes because my colleague, Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin has talked about it. But I want to talk about assessment again, which I think is an important aspect of learning, yet today our assessment methods are still focused on the quantity that students have learnt, rather than the quality of their learning and retention. Many of us are aware of diagnostic assessment, where assessment is used to diagnose students' needs, so that the learning process can be improved to help them acquire knowledge better. In short, diagnostic assessment is less about KPIs, more about taking the interest of each individual child at heart. It means education to harness his or her skills, to address his or her needs, and to encourage and groom each child's unique strengths.",44,230,013-002-094-080-017-230,409

I know intimately the pressures of parenting and I am familiar with the worries any parent has about the well-being and performance of our kids in schools. But let us be honest  parents are equally responsible in the education of our children. In our bid to make a living, to ensure that we best provide for our children materially, have we become so caught up with work that there is a trade-off in our time spent with them? Have we also passed on that role of education fully to teachers, rather than undertake part of it ourselves?

Scientific research tells us that children have objective developmental stages. Below the age of seven, especially, they need large amounts of time for free play. This develops personal and social awareness, gross and fine motor skills, and a foundation for learning. It is more important to directly encounter the things in the world that words and numbers describe, than to recite those words and numbers in an academic way.

One way to do this is to shift early education away from a linear academic emphasis, to a more rounded emphasis focusing on holistic growth.

As Dr Nirmala Karuppiah, an early childhood and special education lecturer at the National Institute of Education, stated in a news article, ""As tuition is about sitting at a table doing pencil and paper activities as well as rote learning and acquiring academic skills, it could actually cause more harm than good for some children.

In the early years, children learn mainly through active exploration of the environment. In the words of Albert Einstein, ""Play is the highest form of research."" In fact, our current ""Nurturing Early Learners"" curriculum already recognises that children are naturally curious and does outline a framework that encourages learning through play. However, I am not sure whether this is followed by all ECDCs. From what I have seen and what other parents have shared online and with me, play is not a strong focus in some of the ECDCs. We also need to look into how we can provide our early childhood educators with enough time and flexibility to allow for creative exploration and play.",12,253,013-002-094-080-017-253,432

2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"To support caregivers and educators, it is vital that student-to-teacher ratio remains small so that each child receives the attention he or she needs. To prevent disruptive relationships between caregivers and children in their care, it is also important to reduce the rate of turnover in these positions. Attractive salaries, incentives and supervision should be put in place for educators of young children. When children feel cared for in a stable and supportive relationship, stress naturally goes away, and learning takes care of itself. In fact, shifting our priority to care over academic outcomes is key in helping children thrive and reach their full potential.",14,255,013-002-094-080-017-255,434
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Fourth, the future of our education requires us to cater to the emotional health of students more comprehensively. I am heartened to see that schools remain vigilant in preventing further suicides in children. However, that is not adequate. We want children to thrive, not simply survive. A survey by Chapter Zero, a social enterprise working with parents, caregivers and educators in Singapore, showed that the top two qualities parents hoped to see for their child were ""healthy relationships with others"" and ""strong emotional health"". Approximately half the parents interviewed were concerned that the educational system did not support students to develop these qualities. Seventy percent of the parents raised the need for more emphasis on social-emotional learning in pre-schools and Primary schools, particularly on mindfulness, empathy and conflict management.",15,256,013-002-094-080-017-256,435

Studies have shown that there is correlation between the level of pro-social behaviour that a student showed in kindergarten and their education and job prospects, criminal activity, likelihood of substance abuse, and mental health in adulthood. Other studies likewise indicate that feeling socially connected as a child is more strongly associated with happiness in adulthood than academic achievement is.",16,257,013-002-094-080-017-257,436

MOE's Enhanced Performance Management System (EPMS) was instituted in 2005 and reviewed in 2014.

How can the abstract concept of modelling be effectively and comprehensively explained to an eight-year-old child who is only two years into the Primary school system? Is our education system, in its pursuit to be competitive, inadvertently taking away the joy of learning? How are our students supposed to spend time to explore and discover their love for Mathematics, if they are inundated with planning out models for problem sums today? Shall we not guide our students to discover what they do not know and assist them to explore alternatives, rather than providing concepts and solutions?

2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio),"I think there is a tendency to regard tuition as the scourge of our education system. But we should also step back and take a look at it from the perspective of there are times when students do need additional help if they are weak in their subjects, if they are struggling, for them to be able to have the opportunity to take tuition in order that they may actually improve. And while I take the point also that parents who perhaps have the means to afford tuition of a different level would be able to pay for that tuition, we also do have self-help groups and community organisations that are able to provide tuition to needy students, to needy families for students who need help at affordable rates. I think the issue here is perhaps one that I do feel strongly about, and that is for parents to understand how tuition fits into the education of their children.",11,303,013-002-094-080-017-303,482

I used to see her with her child. And increasingly, on the weekends, her child would be with her less and less. And I actually her one day, ""Where is your child?"" she said, ""Oh, he is having tuition"". I said, ""Okay"". The next week, I saw her again, and I asked, ""Where is your child?"" She said, ""He is having tuition."" And one day, I asked her, I said, ""Madam, you don't mind if I ask you, why is it your child seems to be going for a lot of tuition on the weekends? Shouldn't he be here with you having some fun?"" She said, ""What to do? He is so lazy. If I don't send him for tuition, he is never going to do his work.""",12,304,013-002-094-080-017-304,483

And if people can afford tuition, then get tuition for your children if they need to improve and if they are struggling with their subjects. But I would hope parents would also encourage their children to take ownership of their learning, to be these self-directed learners that we are talking about, rather than regard tuition as a way of ensuring that children do their work.",14,306,013-002-094-080-017-306,485

What do you do when there is no one left to tell you how to do your work? When there is no one left to tell you what assignments you should do? When there is no one left to tell you which 10-year series you should practise? That is the challenge. Because you cannot have tuition throughout your entire life. Or maybe you can, and that is why people have life coaches, psychologists and psychiatrists.",15,307,013-002-094-080-017-307,486

They are able to achieve good GPA scores in the Polytechnic, which reflects their ability to do well academically. They are transformed from being regarded as academically poor or average, into good academic achievers. Now, the main difference, of course, is that they are now in a system that measures academic achievement in terms of coursework and skills capability, as opposed to the ability to study for an exam.",17,309,013-002-094-080-017-309,488

Ultimately, a good PSLE T-score demonstrates a child’s ability to cram for exams and deliver in a controlled exam-based environment, and one wonders if that is an accurate reflection of his or her potential.",18,310,013-002-094-080-017-310,489

Having a degree, for example, is only one of the many peaks of excellence, and we have indeed seen many examples of successful people who do not have degrees.

As evidenced by how our post-Primary and tertiary education sectors have produced a varied pool of talent who are skilled in a variety of different fields. Could we not also allow our Primary schools to be more diverse in offering their own curriculum that caters to different learning needs and aspirations?",22,314,013-002-094-080-017-314,493

Indeed, you would not tell a brain surgeon how to perform surgery. But everybody seems to want to tell teachers and educators how they should teach the children in school, so it is tough.

Again, this encourages elitism, where the affluent parents will be able to get their kids on the school team because they can afford the additional coaching.",18,338,013-002-094-080-017-338,517
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"There are also vendors who are harassed by parents on the sidelines – parents who yell instructions and abuse during tournaments and pressure the coaches to play their children. Again, this is not what playing sport is about. Worse still, children who have parents who work lose out because their mothers or fathers are not at the training or competition grounds to lobby on behalf of their children. This is behaviour that is fundamentally wrong.",19,339,013-002-094-080-017-339,518
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"Sir, I urge the Ministry to take a closer look at how schools organise their PE curriculum and CCAs, and how external vendors are appointed. For sports CCAs, what are the credentials of these vendors and how are they assessed? It cannot just be about winning tournaments. Perhaps, Sport Singapore, the Singapore Sports Institute and the Singapore Sports School can lend their expertise to help schools craft the PE and sports CCA curriculum so that every child can enjoy and reap the benefits of sport.",20,340,013-002-094-080-017-340,519
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"Teachers managing sports CCA as well as vendors could also be better trained to nurture children who play sport, which could include advice on nutrition and physical and mental wellness. Sir, what I am sharing is probably not new to many in this House, or to any parent with school-going children. But I raise this now, in light of this Motion, to strongly urge the House that if we are serious about encouraging our children to pursue their passions, that education continues to be the pathway for success for those who have less, then perhaps it is time that we pay more attention to sports education. Sports in our schools should be a meeting place for friendship, fellowship, and the pure enjoyment of sport – regardless of your family and financial background. It is one of the few places in a child's schooling life where he or she is not judged by their academic prowess, and we should do all we can to return to this spirit.",21,341,013-002-094-080-017-341,520
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"Sir, I would like to turn our attention to my second point, about the Direct Schools Admission programme. When conceived and introduced in 2004, the programme was to enable Primary 6 and Secondary 4 students who are exceptionally talented not just in academics but also CCAs, and sports included, to be guaranteed places in Secondary schools or Junior Colleges, through tests and trials. While the scheme has worked and Minister Ng Chee Meng has announced that a review is being undertaken to address how different schools select students, here are some observations about the scheme that merit further scrutiny.",22,342,013-002-094-080-017-342,521
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"One unintended consequence of the scheme is the emergence of ""DSA"" coaches. These are sports coaches who have, over the years, studied the DSA entrance requirements of schools and created programmes that aim to guarantee your child a place in the school of choice – if you enroll your child in their classes over a period of time. Some of them are so good at it that they will refund the fees if your child does not make it to the school of your choice through the DSA programme.",23,343,013-002-094-080-017-343,522
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"Sir, all parents want the best for their children. So, parents who can afford the fees would enrol their kids in these programmes. But what do these coaches actually teach? A friend, whose child attended one of these classes, talked about how the coach instructed the child not to pass the ball to his team mates during the trials or when the coaches from the DSA schools were observing him. This is to ensure that the child would outshine his team mates and secure that precious DSA place in the school.",24,344,013-002-094-080-017-344,523
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"Another child, who had no interest in any sport, was enrolled by his parents into a shooting class that guaranteed success in the DSA trials, and a place in a top school. Yes, the boy got into the school through DSA, but is now miserable as he does not enjoy the sport and only enrolled and played it to get into the top school. We need to ask ourselves if this is what the DSA scheme is intended to be, and if this ""gaming"" of the system is acceptable. Is this what sports is about? Do we want to encourage such behaviour and worse, reward it, by giving these children places in our top schools?",25,345,013-002-094-080-017-345,524
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),What we need is for the system to also recognise and reward children who exemplify good sportsmanship and character as these are qualities that will stay with them beyond their school sporting careers. Just look at Japan at this years' FIFA World Cup in Russia. They were a hair's breadth away from beating Belgium and qualifying for the Quarter Finals but the world now remembers them more for their behaviour off the field – for their fair play and how they left their dressing room spotless and penned a note of thanks in Russian to their hosts.,26,346,013-002-094-080-017-346,525
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"Perhaps, the Ministry can work on tweaking the DSA trials to include criteria such as sportsmanship, fair play and traits and values exhibited like Sean See from St Andrew's Secondary School. Sean, the school's hockey captain, captured our hearts earlier this year, when he asked the umpire not to allow a goal that his team had scored when their opponent was not ready, as he felt it would not have been fair to the other team. This resulted in his team eventually losing the match. To me, values such as integrity and fair play are as important, if not more, than one's ability as an athlete. By including these other criteria in the DSA selection process, the Ministry would send a strong signal to the teachers, coaches, parents and children about the kind of young Singapore it hopes to nurture. And it will also create a more level playing field as these values cannot be paid for.",27,347,013-002-094-080-017-347,526
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"Mr Speaker, Sir, the other main role in education belongs to us, the parents. Fundamentally, it is up to parents who should know and understand our children best, to make the best decision with them and not for them. Let me share a personal experience which I think has helped me become a better father. I think most people in this House know that I love sport – I played it at all levels and am a true football nut. So, when my son came along, all I dreamed of was to see him have the same passion for sport as I did, and for football, in particular. When he was about four or five years old, I enrolled him in a football academy, as I had wanted him to have a very good foundation. But after a few weeks of watching him from the sidelines, I noticed that while he seemed happy enough, instead of going after the ball and passing it, all he seemed to do was chase after the other children, much like he was playing a game of ""catching"". So, on the way home from training one day, I decided to have a heart to heart with him. ""Do you actually enjoy football?"" I asked. ""Yes daddy, very much"", he said, smiling. Then, I pressed, ""But why do you just chase the kids around?"" The smile on his face turned to a frown, and almost bursting into tears, he said, ""Actually, Daddy, I don't like football at all."" So I said, ""Why didn't you say anything, you don't have to play the sport if you don't like it?"", and his response broke my heart, ""Because you love football, Daddy."" That is when I realised that as a father, I just assumed that my child would love what I loved, and would want to be just like me. But I had never bothered to ask him what he liked.",28,348,013-002-094-080-017-348,527
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-017,Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member),"So, for the next few years, we encouraged him to play whatever sport or activity he wanted. He tried everything from aikido, to swimming to table tennis to golf. And finally, after a few years later, on his own, he began to develop a love for football – thank God! – and is today an accomplished footballer, having played competitive football for school and club. It is a sport he genuinely loves, for all the right reasons. As parents, it is natural to want our children to be just like us and have the same interests as us. As a parent, it is also easy to fall into the trap of seeing other parents and their children succeeding and exceling in different sports and thinking to ourselves – our boy or girl could also do that. I know of parents who have pushed their children so hard that their children end up resenting not just the sport but their parents as well.",29,349,013-002-094-080-017-349,528

It was an interview with Andira Zafirakou, who was recently crowned the best teacher in the world, the 2018 winner of the Global Teacher Prize. She says and I quote, ""Every child is different. Some children will really benefit from the military lining up and find it comforting.

Neither is it for the purpose of competition. Sports is more than that. Children enjoy the benefits of playing in the field through their interaction with one another, and learn values, such as comradeship, hard work, discipline and honesty. When children engage themselves in sports, they develop among them the sense of competition, become unenvious, forbearing, develop together good virtues and the sense of accepting defeat. At present sports in schools has become very competitive.",32,352,013-002-094-080-017-352,531

Disabilities and special needs make us different from the majority – the way we look, the way we walk, the way we talk, the way we think.

First, we must be careful not to place the interest of one group of students above the other. The interests of both groups are equally important. Secondly, we must create opportunities for both groups of children to play, learn and grow together. We should to the extent, practicable, remove barriers against children accepting one another.",8,27,013-002-094-080-018-027,567

They accommodated my disability but they treated me the same. So, when I did not do my homework, I was punished. When I talked too much, I was punished. But I was like any other child. It was not always easy; there were times when I felt like a burden. I am sure there were many times my friends felt like I was a nuisance. But you know what, we grew up together.

A year and a half after that, during the debate on the President's Address, the Minister of State for Trade and Industry at that time, Mr Lee Yi Shyan, in pushing for a re-examination of the skills upgrading policy then, had pointed out that ""half of what you learn in four years in Polytechnics and Universities can become obsolete in two years, and they get halved every two years"".",17,75,013-002-094-080-018-075,615
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"Much more recently, just this year, during the debate on Annual Budget Statement, our hon colleague Mr Patrick Tay drew our attention to the issue of skills being at risk. Mr Tay’s emphasis and those of the other hon Members I had cited above should lead us to realise that the shelf-life of skills and learning has always been short and is possibly getting even shorter in some fields. Because this shelf life is not much longer than the education and training which had led to their acquisition in the first place, an important objective of a sound education system should be to lay the foundations for a continuous process of learning.",18,76,013-002-094-080-018-076,616
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"There is already good appreciation about the importance of continuous learning. And there is also widespread acknowledgement that such continuous learning, regardless of whether we speak of lifelong educational pursuit, retraining at work or continuous upgrading of skills, is thrust upon us by the advance of technology and the resulting decline in the shelf-life of knowledge and skills.",19,77,013-002-094-080-018-077,617
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),The imperative for continuing education and lifelong learning to be relevant to the needs of the economy is at least as urgent as it is for early basic education. Adult learners have to juggle different roles and the immediacy of their roles in the workforce mean that their skills must be responsive to current employer needs. Our education system must meet the needs of lifelong learners and skills upgraders with the same rigour that it has cemented the basic educational foundation of early learners.,20,78,013-002-094-080-018-078,618
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),The system of skills training and upgrading should be built upon a firm foundation imbued in young learners from an early age that learning itself must always be a lifelong pursuit.,21,79,013-002-094-080-018-079,619
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"The importance of learning takes on added prominence during the current industry transformation drive.

2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"Sir, we should be careful to realise that just as sailors who navigate choppy waters need to seek safe harbour to replenish their strength and supplies, it is important for our basic education system to provide anchorage to learners that will stand them in good stead when they embark upon their lifelong learning endeavour.",23,81,013-002-094-080-018-081,621
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),The last thing we want is for everyone to discard the strong foundations currently offered by our education system. Learning is age-dependent and young learners benefit from the security of a rigorous grounding in the basics. Having a solid foundation in the basics also prepares them for self-directed learning throughout the rest of their lifelong journey as a learner.,24,82,013-002-094-080-018-082,622
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member),"Hence, while we seek to continually upgrade and keep our education system relevant, we must also seek to retain those fundamental pillars of strength which continue to have a timeless relevance for any learner.",25,83,013-002-094-080-018-083,623

2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"In any education system, the evaluation system – or exams – is the critical link between what should be taught, verses what ends up being taught.

2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Why is critical thinking important? Well, the humanities study the human condition, society and culture. Or, in short, life. Just like in life, there is no right or wrong answer in the humanities. There is only a way to think rationally and look at the big picture. If we do not teach this, we are doing a disservice to our students and are holding them back beyond their school years.",5,91,013-002-094-080-018-091,631
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Why then are some teachers still focused on encouraging students to regurgitate answers, rather than to thinking critically and independently? One contributing factor could be the way in which our humanities are being marked at the ""O"", ""N"" and ""A"" levels.",6,92,013-002-094-080-018-092,632
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Currently, overseas educators from Cambridge mark our examination papers. They then provide annual feedback to MOE on how our students fare. In addition, every few years, the Cambridge chief markers will come down to Singapore to provide in-depth feedback to selected Singapore teachers under the ""train-the-trainer"" approach. These Singapore teachers then relay the gist of what they have learnt from the Cambridge markers, to the rest of the teachers.",7,93,013-002-094-080-018-093,633
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"However, because information is sometimes lost in the transmission process, some of the Singapore humanities teachers might not get a uniform picture of how Cambridge evaluates our students. And some of these teachers, operating without the fullest clarity and I must stress, out of the best intention for their students, fall back on encouraging pattern recognition and regurgitation of pre-determined answers.",8,94,013-002-094-080-018-094,634
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"If this is a possible issue, then a possible solution must be to try to provide as much clarity as possible to our teachers. One way of doing so is to build up a team of Singapore based professional markers for humanities subject, even as we continue to work with Cambridge as our examination partner. These professional markers can be former teachers. But I hope that once they become markers, they should not be allowed to go back to become teachers or part-time tutors. Besides focusing on marking, they can also work closely and strengthen MOE's curriculum development team. And because this team is based in Singapore rather than in Cambridge, they will have ample time to communicate with full clarity with all our Singapore-based teachers.",9,95,013-002-094-080-018-095,635
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"The benefits are clear. Because our teachers will have minimal uncertainty on how the markers will grade the subjects, our curriculum developers will have more opportunities to  one, promote independent thinking; and two, shorten the curriculum review cycle. At the same time, it will ensure a clear divide between the professional markers and the teachers, so that the markings can continue to be fair and equitable.",10,96,013-002-094-080-018-096,636
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Next, I would like to talk about applied subjects. I am very heartened by the recent moves to teach applied subjects, such as computing, mobile robotics, sports science, and retail operations at our ""N"", ""O"", and ""A"" levels. This is a good move that can prepare our students for the future and I believe we can build on this. We can do so in two ways  one, by ensuring our students are taught the most current curriculum; and two, by ensuring our students are being evaluated by accredited examiners with directly relevant industry experience.",11,97,013-002-094-080-018-097,637
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Currently, even for applied subjects, I was told that the curriculum is set two to three years before the actual year of assessment, and the curriculum will last for four to six years before review. As we know, in some applied subjects, changes in technology happen quickly, and a six-to-eight year curriculum cycle could be too long.",12,98,013-002-094-080-018-098,638
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Of course, one can argue that at the ""N"", ""O"", and ""A"" levels, our students can focus on the foundational knowledge for applied courses. Nevertheless, there could be scope for us to do better. One way we can do so is to examine what is being done in Hong Kong. I am not advocating for our examination board to be privatised like in Hong Kong. Rather, I am suggesting we take a look at how Hong Kong's examination board works with the private sector to accredit certain members of the relevant industries to evaluate students. For example, students learning auto repair would be evaluated by specially accredited actual mechanics, operating in real workshops, rather than in mock-up classrooms. I do understand this is a departure from the current way we evaluate, but I hope that we can at least explore incorporating elements of this approach even for our ""N"", ""O"", and ""A"" levels.",13,99,013-002-094-080-018-099,639
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon),"Related to this is to encourage more industry practitioners to join in as teachers or as part time teachers for applied subjects. Today, I believe that we have a lot of capable industry practitioners who are teaching and lecturing at Universities and they find it a privilege to do so. Perhaps we could also confer the same amount of prestige and encouragement to encourage more of these industry practitioners, very excellent industry practitioners to do so in ITE and Polytechnics as well.",14,100,013-002-094-080-018-100,640

Today, MCCY is already encouraging students to interact with their peers doing sports outside of their school. Where we can improve is this  MOE and MCCY can collaborate by growing ActiveSG's Sports Academy and Clubs to absorb even more students from all schools, and give them CCA under the LEAD framework. At the same time, MOE can also invite Sports Academy to send teams to join various inter-school sports teams.",18,104,013-002-094-080-018-104,644

They are simply assigned to the school nearest to their homes. I visited one of these schools; I spoke to the students, and they all go home for lunch because they said it is a five to 10-minute walk, different directions, and then they come back to school. They did not have a choice where to go to. However, in Switzerland, the affluent have a choice, because they can pay for their children to go to private schools.

2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim),"Benjamin is currently a second-year student with visual impairment, studying for his Diploma of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Singapore Polytechnic. To ensure a smooth transition to Singapore Polytechnic, the SSO and Benjamin’s lecturers worked closely to see how they could facilitate his learning, such as enlarging the font sizes on slides and handouts. The SSO also arranged for Benjamin to visit the Resource Centre at the Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped, so he could find the best AT Device for his needs. He eventually chose a handheld device which makes reading easier by enlarging fonts and adjusting the colour contrast of materials. With the support of his lecturers, friends, and staff from the SSO, Benjamin has been doing very well.",45,219,013-002-094-080-018-219,759

I think we have made progress, but we still have ways to go. As I see the passion and the concerted efforts of the teachers in both SPED and mainstream schools, and also the passion and the touching words and what was spoken earlier, I am confident such inclusion efforts will gain momentum.",47,221,013-002-094-080-018-221,761

We must welcome and support them, regardless of their background and starting point in life. In other words, where we begin in life will not dictate where we end up. Only then can we call ourselves a truly inclusive nation. [Applause]",49,223,013-002-094-080-018-223,763

They have put the focus on the love of learning as the driving force for education, and called for the Government and people to work together to ensure that education is accessible, inclusive and lifelong. I would also like to thank Ms Rahayu for her amendments which help to flesh out how we should do this and provides the frame for the action plan, as well as all the Members who have spoken and contributed to this debate.",1,224,013-002-094-080-018-224,764

2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"The first is that parents want reassurance that their children will have a bright future and that they will not lose out. We have heard much about a future-ready education system, stress, competition, the PSLE, lifelong learning, inclusivity. All these are really different aspects of the same concern, which is, trying to ensure that our children have the best possible chance to succeed.",3,226,013-002-094-080-018-226,766

2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Mr Louis Ng, Mr Darryl David and Mr Kok Heng Leun spoke about this. We do not want the children's years in school to be only about homework, tests, assessments, grades and examinations scores. Schooling must also be an enjoyable educational experience, built around a love of learning, of exploration, and of play. It must be holistic, teaching skills like critical thinking, to prepare them for the new world ahead, and it must have the emotional well-being of students at heart. Mr Ganesh Rajaram and Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin also spoke about the need to change our culture, that as teachers, parents, as a society, we need to give our children space to grow. We need to listen to them better in order to support them better.",5,228,013-002-094-080-018-228,768
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Third, many of you also spoke about how this love of learning must be a lifelong one. Ms Thanaletchmi, Assoc Prof Randolph Tan and Mr Darryl David urged that our children must continue to learn after they leave school, and throughout their working lives. Employees and employers alike must be nimble and receptive to on-the-job training.",6,229,013-002-094-080-018-229,769
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Fourth, this debate reflects our social conscience. Many Members of Parliament, including Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan, Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin and Mr Azmoon Ahmad raised the issue of inequality – you worry that the vulnerable, the disabled and the low-income will not be able to get as much out of the education system as those who are better off, that they will get left behind and that the gap is widening. This shows that, as a people, we care about those who are disadvantaged.",7,230,013-002-094-080-018-230,770
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"A fifth common theme was that of inclusivity, integration and social mixing. Ms Rahayu Mahzam, Ms Chia Yong Yong and Mr Henry Kwek have spoken passionately about this. We are concerned that children born with special needs will go through life without being embraced or valued by society. We are concerned that the divide between rich and poor or between children from different backgrounds and communities may grow – this is important because it says something about our values and the kind of society we want, the kind of people that we are, and we want a society that is more equal, more unified.",8,231,013-002-094-080-018-231,771

2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"On all these broad objectives, we are aligned. These are MOE's objectives too. We too want every child to have a bright future and to do well. Like Members of Parliament, who have spoken, we want them to have a wonderful school experience. We are also concerned about the vulnerable, and we want integration and inclusivity to be at the heart of our education system. Where we may differ in some aspects is on the strategies or solutions, but let me reassure the House that we are very much at one in terms of the overall aims and objectives.",10,233,013-002-094-080-018-233,773
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Minister Ong and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Faishal have already explained some of our Ministry's programmes, and the considerations behind our work. So, let me wrap-up MOE's response by sharing with the House where we are coming from in terms of the big picture  our mission, what we have done, what we are doing and what we will be doing.",11,234,013-002-094-080-018-234,774
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Everyday many vehicles and pedestrians go past the MOE signage along North Buona Vista Road. Most people do not stop to examine the signage, but if you did, you would see MOE's mission statement on it, which is  ""Moulding the Future of Our Nation"". It is a mission we take very seriously. MOE has walked a life journey, not just with the nation, but also with every Singaporean who has passed through the education system. Let me show you that journey through the eyes of three generations of women.",12,235,013-002-094-080-018-235,775
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"When Singapore achieved independence in 1965, Mdm Iris Wong was 11 years old. She used to walk in the hot sun to May South Primary School. School was often disrupted because of social unrest and racial riots. In those early years when Singapore was a fledgling nation, MOE played a key role in racial harmony and integration, bringing children together in a national school system. Our priority for a newly independent country was mass education for a young population and to help people get jobs in an era of industrialisation.",13,236,013-002-094-080-018-236,776
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Mdm Wong's education journey ended after Secondary 4 – which was considered quite a high attainment in those days. She began work in her father's tailoring shop and had 3 children, one of whom was a daughter, Josephine. Josephine went to Outram Primary in the 1980s. She drank milk out of little plastic packets and brushed her teeth over the school drain – as I did when I went to primary school in the 1970s! In 1970s we had milk too because milk was to help children get strong bones as rickets was still a problem at that time, due to poor nutrition in a country that was still not well off.",14,237,013-002-094-080-018-237,777
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"By Josephine's time, the economy had changed. We were moving up the value chain, from a lower-skills manufacturing base, which was producing things like fish hooks and matches, to a more capital intensive and a high skills economy, producing electronics and petrochemicals. The education system had to adapt to equip Singaporeans to thrive in this new situation and also to address high drop-out rates.",15,238,013-002-094-080-018-238,778
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"That was when streaming was introduced to cater to our children's different learning paces. The school drop-out rate fell sharply after streaming. Attrition for the first Primary school cohort that was streamed was about one in 10 students, as compared to the previous rates of one in three. Josephine left school, went to Polytechnic, worked for a few years and then she got a degree in Marketing Communications. By the time she was being courted by her husband-to-be some time in the 2000s, the education system was coming of age and undergoing a paradigm shift. We had entered the phase of the Knowledge-based Economy, where ideas and information are the key drivers of growth. We needed a people with entrepreneurial spirit, the ability to innovate and we had to build intellectual capital.",16,239,013-002-094-080-018-239,779
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"So, then-Prime Minister Mr Goh Chok Tong introduced a new education philosophy ""Thinking Schools, Learning Nation"", that reduced curriculum time to make room for more inquiry-based activities that would develop creativity and critical thinking. We also gave our schools greater autonomy to be innovative in programmes, and invested in Information and Communications Technology. To deliver this, we hired more teachers, and strengthened teachers' professional development to improve teaching quality.",17,240,013-002-094-080-018-240,780
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"In the 2000s, to cater to new and different aspirations, MOE introduced more choice, diversity and flexibility in terms of types of schools and programmes. In 2010, Josephine gave birth to a beautiful baby girl, Vera. Vera is now eight years old. She started Primary school in CHIJ Toa Payoh last year. The future that she faces will be very different from that of her grandmother and her mother. The beginning of this decade when she was born marked the end of the Global Financial Crisis and the beginning of what we call the future economy. The future economy calls for a very different sort of education from that undertaken by Iris and Josephine. It will be a VUCA environment – Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous. It is a future driven by the need for skills, innovation, adaptability and flexibility. It will be disrupted by technology. It will see the weight of the global economy shift towards Asia.",18,241,013-002-094-080-018-241,781

2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"So, where are we at now? Now, it is really about developing each individual and creating multiple pathways.",21,244,013-002-094-080-018-244,784
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"First, we now put a lot more emphasis on developing the whole child – not just their academic achievements. This is key to our student-centric, values-driven philosophy. I know people do not like jargon like ""student-centric"", but basically what it means is we put the child at the centre of it and we build around that. MOE's approach is actually best reflected in our 21st Century Competency Framework. I have asked the Clerks to put copies of this on Members of Parliament's chairs. You may see it, and if I could ask you to refer to it. It is often referred to as the MOE Swiss Roll but I think if we want to be technically correct – it should be an Arctic Roll – baby boomers will know which ice-cream I am referring to.",22,245,013-002-094-080-018-245,785
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"If you look at it, you will see that core of the framework is values, because at the end of the day, the most important thing is, for the individuals, what kind of person you are, your character, so, values are at the core of it. And this ties in with character and citizenship development, which we have made as a central part of our education system.",23,246,013-002-094-080-018-246,786

So, for the Members who have spoken about the need for character, for good attributes, please be assured that this is actually a focus of our education system.",24,247,013-002-094-080-018-247,787
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Next, we have to ensure that our children will attain knowledge – to have a solid foundation in literacy and numeracy. But this book knowledge alone is not enough. This year, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published a paper entitled ""Education 2030  The Future of Education & Skills"". Future-ready students will need broad knowledge, but also practical skills, like the ability to utilise new technology. These skills will be in great demand by employers. And even this is not enough. The churn and change caused by technology and other disruptive factors means that learning has to continue well into adult life. The ability to learn, un-learn and re-learn will be key.",25,248,013-002-094-080-018-248,788
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Much of the stress that we have talked about is really driven by the assumption that there is only one path to success – the academic route. This has led to the fear that if children do not get into certain schools or into the express stream, then they will not have a bright future. However, there are in fact many different paths to success.",26,249,013-002-094-080-018-249,789
2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"Different children have different personalities, talents and abilities. Some are more academically inclined. Others are much better with their hands or are more creative and artistic. And different children respond differently to different methods of teaching. The future economy will be much more diverse than today's. Doctors, lawyers, engineers, architects and accountants will still be around but the way they do their jobs will be very different. There will be increased demand for jobs in new areas like Financial Technology, Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, and Virtual Reality. Dell Technologies recently released a report based on a survey of 3,800 business leaders across the world. It estimated that 85% of the jobs in 2030 have not even been invented yet.",27,250,013-002-094-080-018-250,790

2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-018,The Second Minister for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah),"And for that, you cannot have a system that is one-size-fits-all, nor is there any longer a single measure of success. And learning has to be lifelong. In recognition of this, we have, over the years, introduced different types of schools and programmes to cater for the different strengths and talents of different individuals. We have the usual ""O""- and ""A""-level route, but we also have established the Integrated Programme in various schools to give students more time to immerse themselves in broader learning experiences. We have the Sports School to cater for sporting talent, School of The Arts for those artistically inclined; we have the NUS High School of Math and Science for those who are STEM-inclined; and the School of Science and Technology which focuses on STEM as well, but their curriculum also centres on applied and interdisciplinary learning.

We have Secondary schools with Enhanced Art and Music programmes. Mr Kok Heng Leun spoke passionately about Arts and the Humanities.

It is our educators who motivate students and who identify opportunities for them. For example, Outram Secondary School has a remarkable principal, Mr Boo Hian Kok. He formed a task force, consisting of teachers and Student Welfare Officers, to address Long-Term Absentee cases, the children who did not turn up for school. For those teachers, their calendar is cleared for the first few periods in the morning. If students do not turn up by 8.00 am, these teachers will make phone calls, visit homes, knock on their doors, and encourage the families to send them to school.",67,290,013-002-094-080-018-290,830

They build rapport, so that the family trusts that the school has their child’s welfare at heart. And this has helped many students like Jimmy – not his real name – feel welcome and safe. He used to skip school because his stepmother has a chronic illness, and he had to buy her meals. With the school’s help, he now stays with his grandparents, who are better able to care for him. He loves soccer, so the school placed him in a special soccer programme to encourage him to come back. His attendance is now regular.

The question is  where do you set the balance? And that is MOE's task; and that is what MOE strives to do. We have already embarked on the shifts which embody much of what Members have called for.

But mindset is a difficult thing to change. It takes time. And we call on all partners to do this. As I was reading the newspapers today, I flipped to the Forum page and I saw a letter written by a young, 17-year-old Junior College student, Teo Chen Wei. He was talking about PSLE. He wondered whether removing the T-score might help, or whether it might actually result in other means of stress. But the most telling thing in his letter was this  he said, “The most effective way to improve the education system is for parents and children to accept that failure in exams is not failure in life”.

We want excellence, but excellence does not mean excellence purely in academic grades alone. There are many other paths, as I have pointed out. So, you could be excellent in aeronautics, or the culinary arts. Whatever it is, we want excellence because we want our people to do well. At the same time, does failure mean that you cannot progress? The answer is, ""No"", because we have created so many different pathways and we hope that people will see a setback as something from which to learn, and to move forward.",75,298,013-002-094-080-018-298,838

2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-020,Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan,"The first is there has to be a move away from the stalemate between parents and the education system. This is also problematic because a lot of system designers within MOE are also parents. So, I think the first point that has to be made, and that has been made by the three Government speakers earlier, is that everyone acknowledges that stress is there. Everyone acknowledges that the children, or the young persons, or the students are dealing with this stress. How do we alleviate these problems without sacrificing excellence and meritocracy? That has to be at the key of this.",4,5,013-002-094-080-020-005,847

I accept this because partly as a Hindu, I do not believe in cow sacrifice at all. Cows are worshipped. But perhaps, some aspects of the sacred PSLE need to be put to pasture. What those aspects are we have had some idea of it, but I look forward to 2021, when we will know precisely what is going to be changed. We know banding is going to happen, we know certain other aspects are going to be significantly changed. But I think parents generally, Singaporean parents, are wondering what will really differ so that I do not have to go and pay all my money to a tuition teacher.

2018-07-11,Education for Our Future,013-002-094-080-020,Mr Kok Heng Leun,"  A few things. One is to seek clarification. It is about the PSLE. My problem with PSLE is more of it happening at the age of 12, and for children at that age, going through that experience can be quite traumatic. I understand the need for national examinations so that we know, we can allow students to, up to some point, be assessed and then, find the kind of things that they want to go for. Is it possible that we consider, like in some other Scandinavian countries whereby basic education should last more than six years. It can start from six to 16, and during that process, especially when we have this 21st Century Transformation Plan, where there is so much content in there, that within that six years or even more, and when there is examinations and national examinations in between, the process of learning actually cannot be deep enough. Because you will be moving from learning a bit to preparing examinations. And I think perhaps the Ministry should start thinking about that in the long run that we should have this shift.",1,8,013-002-094-080-020-008,850

But I think the point that Mr Kok is really making is that prior to age 12, or leading up to age 12, you want them to enjoy their learning; you want them to have enough content that they have a solid foundation; you do not want them to have so much stress that, not only do they not enjoy it, but it really becomes self-defeating in terms of the educational purpose.",3,12,013-002-094-080-020-012,854

The CDRT judge can order the parties to attend mandatory mediation in the Courts or at the Community Mediation Centre (CMC), attend counselling or fix the case for hearing. Therefore, while community mediation is generally voluntary, an avenue of compulsory mediation does exist, and the failure to comply with the CDRT's order to attend mediation may attract legal consequences. Where the CDRT judge, on hearing the parties, decides to make a Court Order, this order can entail the payment of damages, require a party to do or refrain from doing something (for example, take measures to prevent cigarette smoke from drifting into neighbouring units), or apologise. If a party breaches the Court Order, the other party can apply for a Special Direction to ensure compliance. A refusal to comply with a Special Direction may lead to, among other measures an Exclusion Order – this requires the non-compliant party to move out of his home.",5,6,013-002-094-080-023-006,877
