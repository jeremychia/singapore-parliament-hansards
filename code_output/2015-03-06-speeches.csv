2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I was particularly happy to note that UML related cases have continued to decline, with a further 20% drop in overall harassment and a 46% drop in those where property was damaged.

2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I was also concerned that the overall crime rate had increased by 7.4% largely driven by cheating involving e-commerce. I understand from reading the brief that this is correlated to the rise in people using Internet shopping facilities. I believe this figure was 17% in 2012 but it has since risen to 52%.

2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"As the Police continues to recruit capable Police officers under the Frontline Policing Model, there is a need for a network of community stakeholders who can complement the efforts of our law enforcers.

2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"   Mdm Chair, our heartland neighbourhoods are changing. In rapidly growing new towns like Punggol, we have larger numbers of young couples and families moving in. They are living away from their extended family and childhood friends. Families are increasingly fragmented, and deep networks of trust and social reciprocity have yet to be formed.",1,16,012-002-093-011-003-016,45
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol),"The nature of the threat of crime has also changed, as was described by my colleague, with more scams and cybercrime, less violence and housebreaking. These changes will continue for some time, and the nature of the challenge for Home Team officers will change.",2,17,012-002-093-011-003-017,46

How has this been balanced with the need to keep our neighbourhoods secure in the face of changing threats?",3,18,012-002-093-011-003-018,47
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"   Mdm Chair, everyone knows that Singapore is a safe place, but low crime does not mean no crime. That is the common refrain. We often hear from fellow Singaporeans that they hope to see a stronger police presence, particularly where they live. This desire for more police presence makes it tough to accede to, in view of the labour market and recruiting constraints.",1,19,012-002-093-011-003-019,48
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"The Community Policing Scheme (COPS), which augment the presence of men and women in blue has proven successful. This can be seen from the Crime Statistics released in January. COPS has increased security and safety in the neighbourhood through collaboration and support of the community. My residents in Clementi have remarked that the unlicensed moneylending (UML) harassments have indeed dropped.",2,20,012-002-093-011-003-020,49
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),"There are currently 20 Neighbourhood Police Centres (NPCs) working in partnership with the community to roll out COPS. Many grassroots leaders have enrolled, but I must add that many volunteers in COPS are non-traditional grassroots volunteers who simply want to take ownership of the safety and security of the neighbourhood.",3,21,012-002-093-011-003-021,50
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast),The number of NPCs is targeted to reach 35 by 2015. How can their effectiveness be enhanced to complement the good work of these police officers and to add to the success of the programme. How can the community contribute and participate in taking ownership of the safety and security of their neighbourhoods?,4,22,012-002-093-011-003-022,51
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),   It has been three years since this House passed the amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act to remove the mandatory death penalty in certain limited instances of trafficking. These and other amendments were introduced at a time when Singapore's drug situation had shown some improvement over the years.,1,23,012-002-093-011-003-023,52
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"At that time, however, this House had expressed a concern that the perceived relaxation of the death penalty could lead to a misperception that the law if softening its zero tolerance attitude towards drug trafficking.",2,24,012-002-093-011-003-024,53
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Since then, we have had the following statistics from the CNB  the drug abusers arrested by the CNB have decreased 14% between 2013 and 2014. The number of new drug abusers has also seen a slight decrease of 5% over the same period. In relation to drug abusers, there is a decrease in the recidivism rate for drug abusers released from the DRC over the 2012 period.",3,25,012-002-093-011-003-025,54
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"These are generally good signs, but we cannot and can never afford to be complacent. The Director of CNB recently expressed the concern that two-thirds of new abusers are below the age of 30. Whilst new abusers have come down, the fact is, he said, ""more of our young people are trying drugs"". It is therefore with some alarm that I learn from the Singapore Children's Society that they have started seeing young abusers, some as young as 13 or 14 appear and be treated for drug abuse.",4,26,012-002-093-011-003-026,55
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Madam, two further factors are significant in my view. First, while the street value of drugs in 2014, estimated to be about $8.1 million, has come down markedly from that in 2013, it is significant that the quantity by weight has increased. Cannabis, for instance, has gone up by about 125%.",5,27,012-002-093-011-003-027,56
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"What this tells us is that the same or greater quality of drug is being brought in at a lower value. And this could mean that they are more accessible on the street. Second, of all the new abusers, new methamphetamine abusers made up the largest proportion, while new cannabis abusers saw an increase of 7%. Methamphetamine is one of the most commonly abused drugs amongst youths. It is popular because it has short-term upsides; it has been touted to give you better outcomes for exams, to let you do better in sports and so on. But it also has very severe long-term adverse effects, such as brain damage.",6,28,012-002-093-011-003-028,57
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),These signs tell us that we must remain unabated in our unstinting fight against drugs. The drug problem is a serious social tragedy. We cannot look at it only in terms of the individual drug abuser who suffers from the addiction.,7,29,012-002-093-011-003-029,58
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"In that context, may I please ask the Deputy Prime Minister to comment on two issues  first, to reaffirm Singapore's commitment to an absolute zero tolerance of drug abuse and trafficking; second, in light of the numbers that we see on youths and on methamphetamine, to outline MHA's strategy, specifically in arresting the increase in the number of new and young abusers.",8,30,012-002-093-011-003-030,59
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang),"Finally, may I use the remaining time in my final cut on MHA to record the appreciation and gratitude to the many men and women who serve on the Home Team. We live in an ever-changing environment. We face new and novel threats both from within our own country and from outside. Many of the Home Team officers put their safety and well-being in harm's way on a daily basis as they go about their job to keep Singapore and Singaporeans safe.

2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),The sheer size of the heavy vehicles means it could cause much more severe harm during an accident. I noted from the Singapore Police Force's website that the number of fatalities that resulted from accidents involving heavy vehicles has increased by 37.5% from 32 cases in 2012 to 44 cases in 2013.,2,34,012-002-093-011-003-034,63
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Speeding by heavy vehicles is a major concern. I understand that heavy vehicles are required by law to install speed limiters to restrict their maximum speed to 60 km per hour. There are almost 49,000 heavy and very heavy good vehicles in Singapore end of last year, 2014. How many of the 49,000 heavy vehicles have working speed limiters?",3,35,012-002-093-011-003-035,64
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Very often, I could see heavy vehicles travelling along the second or third lane on a four-lane road, especially along expressway. So, probably, they are speeding. However, the Traffic Police has only caught 57 vehicles for faulty speed limiters or related offences in the past five years. That is, there are 49,000 heavy vehicles on the road but only 57 heavy vehicles were caught with faulty speed limiters by the Police in the past five years and yet in the first half of 2013 alone, 1,766 heavy vehicles were caught for speeding violations. Why the discrepancy?",4,36,012-002-093-011-003-036,65
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"Are heavy vehicles required to check the speed limiter during the annual vehicle inspection mandated by LTA? From what I understand, the check is quite superficial. The annual inspection does not verify if the speed limiter is working or tampered with. It does not need the heavy vehicle to run on the chassis dynamometer to verify if the speed could exceed 60 km per hour. The chassis dynamometer is bit like a treadmill. The chassis dynamometer test is only required if the Police had caught drivers speeding in heavy vehicles. That means they do not have to be tested on a dynamometer unless they are caught by the Traffic Police and they have to send the vehicle for a check more thoroughly.",5,37,012-002-093-011-003-037,66
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong),"So instead of having the Traffic Police do more enforcement action, as mentioned by MHA previously, maybe the Traffic Police could work with LTA to refine the inspection process to better detect whether the speed limiter is malfunctioned during the annual inspection. That is, we have to nip the problem in the bud.",6,38,012-002-093-011-003-038,67

This is in spite of a 7.4% increase in the number of crime cases in 2014 compared to 2013, and this was driven largely by an increase in online crimes. We will say more about that later. The number of unlicensed moneylending harassment cases fell below 6,000 cases in 2014, a substantial decline from the almost 18,000 cases in 2009. The recidivism rate for ex-offenders is low, and has remained relatively stable.",3,45,012-002-093-011-003-045,74

Senior Minister of State Masagos will say more about the work of the Task Force on Youths and Drugs later. The number of immigration offenders arrested continued its downward trend – there were 2,040 immigration offenders arrested in 2014, a 63% decrease from 2009, while maintaining the same level of enforcement. Our fire fatality rate has also remained low compared to cities such as New York, Tokyo and Hong Kong.",4,46,012-002-093-011-003-046,75
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Our road safety situation has improved. The numbers of fatal traffic accidents and fatalities have been on a downward trend for the past three years. The installation of new digital red light cameras at road junctions has also helped to improve safe driving behaviour. The number of violations detected went up sharply when these red light cameras were first installed in March 2014. This is significant, as it means that many drivers had previously been beating red lights, and each of these occasions could have caused a serious accident. However, the number of violations detected per camera per month had decreased by over 80% by December. In fact, by December, fewer total violations were detected by these red light cameras compared to July 2014, even though there were twice as many cameras. The cameras have helped to improve driving behaviour and road safety.",5,47,012-002-093-011-003-047,76

2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"First, terrorism. Terrorism is a global threat, which also impacts Singapore and our region. The conflict in Iraq and Syria has already drawn more than 20,000 foreign fighters, more in numbers and countries of origin than in the Afghanistan conflict in the late 1980s. This includes an estimated 350 from Southeast Asia. Upon their return home these fighters may be more prone to violence. Almost on a daily or weekly basis we see new revelations or videos of fighters from our region who have been involved in Syria or Iraq.",8,50,012-002-093-011-003-050,79

Such attacks are often opportunistic, and therefore difficult to detect and prevent. The Sydney siege in December 2014, the Paris attacks in January 2015, and the Copenhagen shooting in February 2015 took place even when those countries were already on high alert.",9,51,012-002-093-011-003-051,80
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"The Home Team will continue to deter and deal with terrorism by securing our borders, hardening our infrastructure, and maintaining our capability to respond swiftly and effectively to any threats that come to light. We will continue to conduct exercises to hone our response, as well as enhance our intelligence capabilities and work with international partners to identify and pre-empt terrorism threats.",10,52,012-002-093-011-003-052,81
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"We take decisive action early to place persons who pose a threat to our security under detention or restriction orders. Since 2002, our security agencies have detained 66 such persons under the Internal Security Act, and of these 66 persons, 57 have since been released. Currently, nine persons remain under detention and 21 persons are on restriction orders, including some who had intended to take part in conflicts overseas. It is heartening that Singaporeans from all communities understand the fragility of our peace and harmony, and support the work of our security agencies. Other jurisdictions, in Malaysia, Australia, the US and Europe are strengthening their laws to allow preventive measures against terrorism threats.",11,53,012-002-093-011-003-053,82

2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"For example, Singapore's Religious Rehabilitation Group (RRG) launched its Resource and Counselling Centre in July 2014. The RRG has produced pamphlets and on-line material to counter extremist ideology, in particular the type that draws persons to fight in Syria and Iraq. Singapore will be hosting the East Asia Summit Symposium on Religious Rehabilitation and Social Reintegration on 16-17 April 2015, to share best practices and build capabilities among more than 20 participating countries to counter radical ideology.",13,55,012-002-093-011-003-055,84
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Individual Singaporeans too play an important part in maintaining vigilance. If you notice any signs that a friend or family member has possibly been radicalised, you should alert the authorities. Acting pre-emptively could help stop them from harming themselves and protect others from being harmed. Through such alerts, we have already been able to refer young people who were becoming radicalised for religious counselling and to bring them back onto the correct path.",14,56,012-002-093-011-003-056,85
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"However, despite our best efforts, it is not possible to ensure that a terrorist attack will never succeed or happen in Singapore. I agree with Mr Hri Kumar and Mr Arthur Fong about the need to ensure that our society is ready to withstand a terrorist attack, and maintain social cohesion and harmony in its aftermath. Madam, those who carry out such attacks seek to divide our society and strike fear in innocent people. If an incident were to occur, we must stand united as a community and condemn the violent acts of these particular individuals. Such extreme views do not reflect the beliefs of the wider community, and indeed are rejected by them. As Singaporeans, we must continue to build on what we have in common, rather than accentuate our differences. We must also carry on with our daily lives, reach out to each other, and not allow fear to paralyse our society.",15,57,012-002-093-011-003-057,86
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Second, transnational and cyber crime. Globalisation has made it easier for criminal groups to plan criminal activities outside Singapore, carry them out here, and enjoy the proceeds of their crime elsewhere. With the Internet, and electronic transfer of funds, criminals also find it easier to operate across borders, and to enter new markets. The Police and CNB have recently dismantled several cross-border illegal money lending and drug smuggling syndicates. Senior Minister of State Masagos will say more about our efforts to combat the drug menace later.",16,58,012-002-093-011-003-058,87
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Cyber crime, in particular, is a new frontier. Several Members – Mr Hri Kumar and Mr Edwin Tong – spoke about this. Last year, we saw a sharp increase in online crimes. Cheating through e-commerce, Internet love scams and cyber extortion cases grew by 200% to 2,113 cases in 2014. Police will increase their public education efforts against cyber crime. For cheating crimes on the Internet, the victims themselves can take action to avoid them, by being more vigilant and careful. Hence, we have education programmes to inoculate them against this.",17,59,012-002-093-011-003-059,88
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Cyber security is also a concern, as a growing number of critical systems, such as power generation and banking, are computer-controlled or connected to the Internet. Both Government and private entities around the world have been targets of cyber attacks by state and non-state actors. Sensitive information has been stolen, or infiltrated systems damaged. ""Hacktivists"" have also been taking to cyberspace to disrupt services and spread fear and alarm, to promote their causes.",18,60,012-002-093-011-003-060,89
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"We amended the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act in 2013 to enable the Government to take more effective and timely measures to prevent, detect and counter cyber attacks on essential services. After studying the matter carefully, we have also set up the National Cyber Security Centre in April 2014 to provide early detection capabilities, and worked with stakeholders responsible for our critical information infrastructure to strengthen our overall cyber defence capabilities.",19,61,012-002-093-011-003-061,90

As the number of citizens aged 65 years and above grew from about 318,000 in 2009 to 415,000 in 2014, the SCDF saw a corresponding 31% increase in ambulance calls over the same five-year period. We expect demand for emergency medical services to rise further, as the number of elderly citizens doubles to about 900,000 by 2030.

2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"First, making full use of the potential of our Home Team officers. Several Members, such as Mr Hri Kumar, Mr Arthur Fong and Dr Janil Puthucheary, asked about the Home Team's manpower resources. Over the last 10 years, manpower in the Home Team had grown from about 19,300 to 24,700 officers – that is 5,000 officers over 10 years. We will continue to grow these numbers judiciously and moderately. Over the next five years, we will add another 2,000 officers to the Home Team to cope with increasing traveller volumes, boost frontline policing and emergency medical services, and improve response to public order incidents and fires.",27,69,012-002-093-011-003-069,98

The Police started recruiting additional officers last year, and aim to recruit about 150 officers to the SOC by end 2015. And we expect that all 300 officers will be added to the SOC by 2017. This involves selecting very good people and making sure that they are well-trained and properly equipped. So, it takes a little bit of time.",28,70,012-002-093-011-003-070,99

We will partially address this issue by re-employing more of our officers. The retirement age for Home Team uniformed junior officers was extended in October 2013 to 55.

As we rely more on better qualified and trained officers, we will re-structure our Home Team officers' careers to provide more opportunities to advance into the senior ranks. For example, the Police are studying ways to provide more seamless advancement opportunities for their officers.

At least two out of the four firefighters that you see in every SCDF fire vehicle responding to fires daily are full-time NSmen. From this year, we will deploy more SCDF NSmen who are back for their in-camp training, to complement regular officers as frontline responders.

In addition, 119 CCTV cameras have been installed to enhance coverage and monitoring at the checkpoints. Mobile crash barriers have been deployed as an additional line of defence to stop vehicles from dashing through. More than 1,000 additional CCTV cameras will be installed at both checkpoints by June 2017 for greater coverage. These cameras will be connected to a video analytics system to enhance the identification of vehicles and security threats, such as intrusions and unattended baggage. Other measures, such as double drop-arm barriers at the vehicle counters, crash-rated vehicle security barriers, anti-climb fences and anti-crash walls, will be implemented in phases over the next three years to minimise disruptions to the continuing checkpoint operations.",37,79,012-002-093-011-003-079,108
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Madam, these initiatives form part of our overall strategy to use technology to keep our checkpoints secure, while facilitating timely clearance in the face of growing traveller and cargo volumes and, indeed, the growing security challenge. All 164 motorcycle counters at Woodlands and Tuas Checkpoints will be automated by end 2016 compared to the 43 automated ones currently. These automated counters speed up motorcycle immigration clearance by up to 30%, and help reduce congestion for all users of the checkpoints. Automation will also allow ICA to re-deploy officers to other critical tasks, such as screening travellers who may have a high-risk profile.",38,80,012-002-093-011-003-080,109
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"To further improve immigration clearance and border security, from April 2015, ICA will conduct a trial at Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal to capture the fingerprints of all arriving persons. The fingerprints are used to verify the traveller's identity before he is allowed entry to Singapore, and will facilitate automated self-clearance during his departure from Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal. If the trial is successful, ICA will implement this system progressively at other checkpoints. This will make it easier, facilitate departure for visitors and Singaporeans, and also help us save on manpower.",39,81,012-002-093-011-003-081,110
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"To handle the higher traveller volume at Woodlands Checkpoint, ICA will also operate 10 more car counters at the Old Woodlands Checkpoint by 2016. This is on top of the 40 car counters already at Woodlands Checkpoint, and up to 20 additional car counters at Old Woodlands Checkpoint that currently operate during peak periods, Sundays and public holidays. We are also studying the medium- to long-term infrastructure needs at Woodlands Checkpoint and the new transit links across the Johor Straits.",40,82,012-002-093-011-003-082,111

More sea and land-based barriers will be deployed to harden Singapore's coastline. We will equip Police Coast Guard with better surveillance and interception capabilities to deny intrusion and disable vessels carrying out illegal activities. MHA will also integrate the Police Coast Guard, ICA and SCDF marine command bases for better coordinated response to marine safety and security threats.",41,83,012-002-093-011-003-083,112
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"Madam, the community plays a major role in keeping Singapore safe and secure. This includes building resilience to counter radicalisation and withstand any terrorist incident, fighting crime, helping youths in befriender programmes, keeping our roads safe, supporting re-integration of ex-offenders, reducing the risks of fires, and responding to fire and medical emergencies. Many people have volunteered their time, contributed ideas, initiated programmes, responded to emergencies, and reported crimes. And we thank every one of them for their help.",42,84,012-002-093-011-003-084,113

Technology can help us to do so, in a sustainable and scalable manner. Beyond the PolCams that we have in all 10,000 HDB blocks and multi-storey carparks, there are already some five million smartphone cameras in our own pockets, and almost a million vehicles on the road, with an increasing number of them with cameras installed. The Police will take a major step to improve its existing platforms for members of the public to send in videos on traffic violations and crime-related information. This will also be a critical source of information should there be a major incident, such as after the 2013 Boston Marathon bomb attacks when Boston police made good use of videos from the public. Second Minister Iswaran will elaborate on this later.",44,86,012-002-093-011-003-086,115
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Teo Chee Hean,"We will also invest resources to make it easier for community responders to help. If someone has a cardiac arrest, there is no one who can provide help faster than the person who is right next to him. Swift and effective CPR from bystanders can significantly increase the victim's chances of survival. Since May 2012, SCDF's 995 emergency line has medical dispatchers and nurses to coach emergency callers over the phone to administer CPR for cardiac arrest victims in what are often the crucial minutes, before medical assistance arrives. With telephone assistance, the proportion of cardiac arrest victims who received CPR from bystanders has more than doubled from 22% in 2011 to 47% in 2014. Senior Minister of State Masagos will say more about the major initiatives we are introducing for community partners to help save lives in a medical emergency, using both technology available today, as well as using people who want to be our partners.",45,87,012-002-093-011-003-087,116

Over the past 50 years, our Home Team Pioneers have tackled serious security challenges – including terrorist acts, subversion, secret societies, major crimes, riots, drugs, and major civil disasters and fires. They showed courage and determination, and risked their lives to maintain Singapore's peace and security, and to strengthen our national unity and social harmony.",46,88,012-002-093-011-003-088,117

This increase was largely due to cybercrimes such as cheating involving e-commerce. The threat is not unique to us. Cybercrime is rising fast around the world in tandem with the widening reach of the Internet, more interactions and transactions taking place online, and the growing sophistication of criminal organisations.",2,92,012-002-093-011-003-092,121

As our environment changes, new threats and needs will emerge and we must be prepared to invest resources and efforts to build capacity and respond effectively. As Deputy Prime Minister has explained, there is a limit to how much we can grow the manpower of the Home Team. So, it is essential that our Police and other Home Team officers are trained for, and deployed in roles that optimise their impact on the ground. It is equally important that we use technology as a force multiplier and strengthen our community partnerships, to complement the work of our officers.",3,93,012-002-093-011-003-093,122

Under COPS, Community Policing Unit officers are selected, trained and deployed to build ties with residents, and strengthen police presence within the community. Crime Strike Force officers have built up good ground networks with stakeholders within the community, thereby improving Police's ability to fight localised crime. By April 2015, all 35 NPCs would have adopted this new COPS model.",2,98,012-002-093-011-003-098,127

Polcams are a case in point. They are being deployed in our HDB blocks. They help to deter and detect crime, and allow us to deploy our police officers in frontline functions to focus on interacting with the community or investigations where the human touch, experience, instinct and judgement are key.",4,100,012-002-093-011-003-100,129
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr S Iswaran,"Since 2012, when Polcams were first installed, Police have progressively upgraded these cameras from standard to high definition, as the technology has improved and the costs have moderated.

My Police colleagues have kindly lent me this to show what Members what the body-worn cameras look like [the hon Member holds up the item]. As Members can see, it is fairly light, compact, not very sinister-looking. In fact, it is very friendly. The key elements in these are that it has recording capabilities in high definition; the recording can be encrypted; there will be an indicator light when the recording is on, so that members of the public know that a recording is taking place; and also, footage cannot be downloaded, edited or deleted by officers without the proper software and authorisation by the CEO of the NPC. There are some very strong safeguard measures built into this.",7,103,012-002-093-011-003-103,132

But we believe it is better to facilitate the flow of such information which can aid our crime detection and deterrent efforts and find efficient and effective ways to make sense of this data. This is why we have continued to enhance our data and video analytics capabilities to process large volumes of information. For example, Police currently use a video review tool which incorporates compression technology and analytics capabilities. Objects and persons of interest can be identified quickly and an hour-long video footage, for example, can be compressed such that critical events can be viewed quickly in a matter of minutes. This is an example of how we can use technology to gather the information; we can significantly reduce the time needed to process the information and this will enhance efficacy and productivity.",9,105,012-002-093-011-003-105,134

Madam, community partnerships are indispensable to MHA's efforts to keep Singapore safe and secure. Time and again, both in Singapore and elsewhere, the role played by the community has been the key differentiating factor in the deterrence of, or response to, a crime or terrorist incident. A vigilant, prepared and resilient community is an invaluable partner and a powerful ally in the fight against any threat to our safety and security. Therefore, the Police's approach is to support and empower individuals and groups to take ownership of the safety and security of their homes and neighbourhoods.",11,107,012-002-093-011-003-107,136

In 2009, there were about 18,000 UML cases. To tackle this scourge, we strengthened legislation by amending the Moneylenders Act in 2010 and enhanced Police's capabilities to deal with UML. Specialised units at CID and at the Divisional level were established to lead the effort and guide enforcement and preventive efforts.

Some have initiated other commendable efforts. For example, Sembawang NPC and the Nee Soon Town Council have worked together to train conservancy workers to look out for loanshark runners and other illicit activities in the community. It is this concerted and collective effort has led to a substantial 67.8% decline in UML cases over the last five years to about 6,000 in 2014.",14,110,012-002-093-011-003-110,139

That is why we need to emphasise education and prevention - the dictum of caveat emptor has never been more relevant. Just as we would exercise due care for our safety and property in the real world, we should have similar care and vigilance in the virtual world - be wary about buying items when prices are too good to be true, because they often are; refrain from financial transactions or the exchange of personal information with people whom we do not know; and be careful when befriending strangers on the Internet.",18,114,012-002-093-011-003-114,143

Since December last year, Traffic Police have also received almost 100 videos of traffic violations. Depending on your perspective, you would see that as a plus or a minus.

The international and regional drug situation continues to be challenging, with higher production, higher trafficking, and higher consumption of heroin and methamphetamine. International drug syndicates have also formed networks within Southeast Asia to manufacture, receive and distribute drugs to the region. So, Mr Edwin Tong is right - this has increased supply and led to a drop in drug prices.

Among new abusers arrested, two-thirds were below the age of 30, up from half in 2010. The educational profile of abusers arrested is also changing, with more from institutions of higher learning.

Post-release though, regardless of sentence length, all ex-offenders can approach SCORE for employment assistance and job matching. However, we only track the employment outcomes of inmates who approach SCORE for assistance. The outcomes have generally been positive.

Traffic offences pose a serious danger to other road users. For compoundable offences, the Traffic Police has the authority to issue a composition fine and, where required by law, demerit points, in lieu of court prosecution. Therefore, it saves the offenders the hassle of going through the court process.

Second, we will make AEDs more accessible at HDB blocks. For a start, we will install them at the lift lobbies of every two to three HDB blocks in the pilot constituencies. Third, SCDF has developed a new myResponder App that alerts users to cardiac arrest cases nearby and locates the nearest AEDs.

SCDF and SPF will soon launch the pilot of the Neighbourhood Active Responder Programme (or NEAR) in two constituencies, in Tampines East and Tampines West. NEAR represents a fundamental shift in the roles that volunteers play in the community – from passive to active first responders. It complements the ""Save a Life"" initiative.

I would like to ask about the body-worn cameras (BWCs). First of all, whether they are actually going to be issued to all officers in uniforms attending to cases or is it just on selective basis? Secondly, what would be the trigger for the camera to be turned on? Is the officer supposed to exercise on judgement to decide when it is necessary to record the footage? Is it to protect himself if he senses potential problems or is it a SOP that it should be turned on in certain kinds of cases?",3,165,012-002-093-011-003-165,194

I know the Police's position on this. But personally I feel that it is something that it is a worth doing because it not only protects integrity of the statement recording process during investigation, and protects the accused to make sure the statement is accurate, it also, very importantly, protects the Police against frivolous allegations of abuse or accusations of malpractice.",4,166,012-002-093-011-003-166,195

Over the last 10 years, manpower in the Home Team has grown from about 19,300 to 24,700. That is more than 5,000 officers over the last 10 years, and we will continue to grow these numbers. Over the next five years, we will add another 2,000 officers to the Home Team across all the Home Team agencies.

2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr S Iswaran,"  Madam, I thank the Member for her questions. The first set of question pertained to how the body-worn cameras will be used and in what sort of circumstances would it be turned on. First, it is a process of roll-out at the moment, but there will be certain SOPs established. I would say that in general, the approach is  it should be switched on at all times unless there are specific circumstances under which you are authorised on the SOP not to have it switched on. For example, if they are investigating something very sensitive, maybe a sexual assault case or something like that, then, there may be some exceptions. Those are certain areas which they may be specifically excluded. Because if you have too much arbitrariness, then I think the value of it as a source of evidence will also be diminished.",1,169,012-002-093-011-003-169,198

I am pleased that MHA has responded to my call to set up a dedicated cyber crime unit. I have made this call in two of my past PQs over the last half a year. This dedicated crime unit, which is now called Cybercrime Command and is sited in the CID as well as in the Division. I have also noted the education effort to fight cybercrime. Could MHA also consider working with the ISPs to put up online ads at the appropriate website to remind people not to fall into cyber crime?",1,172,012-002-093-011-003-172,201
2015-03-06,Head P – Ministry of Home Affairs,012-002-093-011-003,Mr Ang Wei Neng,"The other question I have is I have noted that the retiring age of a police officer is 55 years old, not the senior officer but the police officer is 55 years old. Would MHA consider extending the retirement age for those officers who are still fit, or re-employ them in a bigger number if they are still fit?",2,173,012-002-093-011-003-173,202

Specifically, the Member's question was whether we would be able to enlist the help of the ISPs in order to enhance the alertness and awareness. That is something that we will certainly consider working with. At the end of the day, the nature of this crime and trend is such that we do need all hands on deck in order to achieve the best possible outcome in terms of preventing its recurrence and growth.

Everyone travels in, out and around Singapore without fear, and our loved ones continue to sleep under the blanket of security the Home Team provides.

South Korean parents were reported to spend up to 19 trillion won, or S$22.4 billion, on extra tuition. But many college graduates were unable to find jobs due to severe labour mismatch.

In this competitive world, Singaporeans cannot take full employment for granted. May I ask the Minister, how will SkillsFuture help Singaporeans understand better the need for lifelong learning to achieve deeper skills in their profession or work – and to remain relevant in the workforce? Just in today's Straits Times, it was reported that fewer workers find their training useful. Can MOE ensure that courses and skills taught by education and training providers are useful and relevant?

Whilst I know that many students rely heavily on tuition, I am concern that tuition will eventually become a crutch for these students. Some of them are so heavily reliant on tuition to achieve high scores that they may have lost the skill of self-directed learning. This will put them at a disadvantage when they enter the workforce as they may not develop problem solving skills on their own whilst they were students.

Teachers can encourage their students to be bold and confident to develop the skill of self-learning without the need for tuition teachers to constantly hold their hands and check their work. If we take a small step in this direction, we will gradually be able to reduce students' over-dependence on tuition. This hopefully will gradually reduce stress as students should see that actual competence, application skills and lifelong learning skills are more important once they enter the workforce.",10,10,012-002-093-011-004-010,220

2015-03-06,Head K – Ministry of Education,012-002-093-011-004,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"Nevertheless, I am convinced that there is a sizeable minority who would be prepared to let their children go through 10 years of education in the same school, even if it means their children would find it difficult to enter the existing top schools without the PSLE. I call upon MOE to seriously study the option, conduct public surveys to gauge the level of support of parents of such pilot schools and to publish these results, so that we can have a meaningful conversation on this education option.",4,89,012-002-093-011-004-089,299

We must continue to enlarge the pathways and accessibility to education in Singapore. The credit scheme introduced by the Government will certainly spark off a lot of interest for working adults to keep on acquiring or learning new skills. Through continuous self-improvement even well into working life, they will achieve mastery in whatever jobs they do. I am confident this will allow them to develop new skills, should they wish to switch to new industries or whatever new things they want to do when the economy continues to restructure.

If a student passes Higher Mother Tongue at O-levels, he does not have to take the subject any further. The incentive is therefore to do Higher Mother Tongue up to O-levels so that you can drop it and do one fewer subject thereafter. And many of our students do that – they earn the two bonus points and then they drop the subject. The choice about doing Higher Mother Tongue is therefore more a tactical one instead of educational one.

New estates like Sengkang and Punggol houses younger families therefore school-based student care centres (SCC) are well received in these areas. Such centres provide the much needed convenience as both parents are working. It provides parents with a peace of mind that is they need not worry where their children will be heading to after school or whether it is safe for them to travel home alone. Such centres also offer enrichment classes and supervision to children doing homework. Such an arrangement reduces the family in need of domestic helper and is especially useful to children that lack home support.,2,207,012-002-093-011-004-207,417

We could continue with the ""study book"" path, with a narrow focus on grades and examinations, and descend into a spiralling paper chase and expanding tuition industry, as many Members have warned. Employers choose not to invest in employees, relying wholly on academic qualifications to determine who gets the job. Educators drill and test, and see their duty as helping students to obtain the best possible examination grades. Parents obsess over grades and spend ever-increasing amounts of resources to give their child an edge over other children. Students chase the next point, and spend most of their time going for more tuition and enrichment in very narrow areas. Stress levels in society climb, and the system churns out students who excel in examinations, but are ill-equipped to take on jobs of the future, nor find fulfilment in what they do.

In 10 years of basic education, we aim to first equip every student with a strong foundation in literacy, numeracy and thinking skills, whatever their starting point. Mr Hri Kumar mentioned the importance of expressing our ideas well and being confident. I fully agree with him and I thank him for these useful suggestions on how we could do better. And, indeed, we are starting very early now in pre-school and in our Primary school, with our new reading and oracy programmes.",30,244,012-002-093-011-004-244,454

Rigour will be maintained, through appropriate assessments as checkpoints to help them track progress, and to make good decisions on the best pathway to continue learning. And where necessary, students can access levelling up programmes to build their basics.",31,245,012-002-093-011-004-245,455

Let me share some observations. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) did a recent survey of adult skills. Workers in Japan ranked highly in their skills, but ranked badly in terms of how well these skills are utilised on the job. At the opposite end, workers in the US ranked poorly in skills, but ranked among the top in using skills on the job – so whatever skills they have, they use them to the fullest.",67,281,012-002-093-011-004-281,491

Now, these courses to learn skills matter. But this OECD study paints a very vivid story that what matters even more is whether workers use the skills learnt. We must not end up debating which courses can enjoy the credit and so on. We must not end up using SkillsFuture Credit to chase another form of qualification. Or debate which courses can acquire qualifications. Training courses are just the means.

Let us all take a collective pause and see whether the way that we are bringing up our children in school, at home, is helping them to develop that independence, that self-directed learning, the resourcefulness and initiative, or whether we are spoon feeding them and that they are going to lose that ability when the crutch is taken away, that they cannot go out and create, invent and build new things.",78,292,012-002-093-011-004-292,502

2015-03-06,Head K – Ministry of Education,012-002-093-011-004,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Why?

2015-03-06,Head K – Ministry of Education,012-002-093-011-004,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"So it is important that even as we debate about SkillsFuture accreditation, and quality of courses and so on, we must not forget that it is not about attending courses per se. We need to seize learning opportunities everywhere, from anyone, throughout life, and even on our own, like the way that Mr John Chang did at the Police Academy many years ago.",83,297,012-002-093-011-004-297,507

But it is also about exploring the unknown, and inventing new possibilities by putting all of our knowledge to creative use – like what Professor Chong is doing to help parents have healthier babies.",84,298,012-002-093-011-004-298,508

The third major shift that we need to make together is to go beyond learning for work, to learning for life. Developing deep skills to succeed at work is important. But life is more than just work. Developing a lively interest in the world around us, in nature and culture, in sports and adventure, in having zest for life and a concern for others are what makes life purposeful and fulfilling.

2015-03-06,Head K – Ministry of Education,012-002-093-011-004,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"So let me share another inspiring story, this time on Edward Chia. Edward is a 31-year-old entrepreneur who started his own business when he was 18 years old. His Timbre group of restaurants is well-known for good dining and live music. Timbre restaurants have a social mission. Combining food with music, his restaurants champion Singaporean musicians and give them a platform. His staff would applaud the performing bands and urge his diners to do the same. Edward shares that, and I quote  ""Everything we do still counts back toward our social mission of supporting Singapore's music scene. At a very simple level, I had an idea I wanted to do, that idea was good for society, and I just wanted to get it done."" He gained respect from his team, many of whom were older, by getting his hands dirty and doing everything he asked of his staff. He washed toilets, cleaned the office, ran the bar, and helped out in the kitchen. So I agree with Mr Baey Yam Keng that it is very important – for our children to learn all these skills. You see how important it is in life. Edward acknowledges that those early years were not easy, but through working with his team, he also learnt from them.",87,301,012-002-093-011-004-301,511
2015-03-06,Head K – Ministry of Education,012-002-093-011-004,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Today, he pays that learning forward. His ventures provide a platform for budding chefs, and he recently partnered Singapore start-up Infinium Robotics to develop drones that can navigate their way around tables to serve food. If this sounds like a scene from Star Wars, it is. There are eight drones delivering food, but this is still an experiment, and an exciting one. What it means is that the waiters can work more productively and do things that machines cannot do.",88,302,012-002-093-011-004-302,512

He gives back to the community, and creates new opportunities for others. He has a deep interest in music and he wants to give Singaporean talent a platform. So he runs enterprises with a mission. From musicians, now he is going on to helping budding chefs. So I hope that we will have a more lively scene in the future.",89,303,012-002-093-011-004-303,513

In fact, I should add that there are very few school systems in the world – none that I know of – which send one-third of their students on overseas trips in order to give them the exposure - there is much we should be thankful for. They interact with peers around the world. And by the way, these are not just students in our top schools. These are students in every school. They lead and participate in a wide range of CCAs.

Let me emphasise that, for me, it is a very important signalling of a shift in our education in that we must place emphasis on character and values. It is a catalyst for change. But for the same reason, we should not overdo it, and that is why the numbers are kept very small. But we will study her suggestion on how we can make it more meaningful. And I am glad that many parents and many students have also spoken to me, and the school principals have noted the progress since we introduced this. And we are actually going beyond all these awards. What is a small part is really the signalling. The real change is in our schools' programmes – in the Character and Citizenship Education programme that has been revamped.

The owner showed them around his shop, demonstrated how a rose garland was made using banana strings, and explained the use of roses on different occasions in the Indian culture. The children were so excited that they decided to set up their own florist shop! This required them to work with each other, practise their Tamil and express their creativity.

Daniel was an ITE student, completing a Higher Nitec in Mechanical Engineering when I first met him last year. Like many young people, he was not sure what his next step should be. He had taken mechanical engineering at ITE but it was not his first choice. He was not sure he wanted to continue in engineering. I asked him what he thought he might like to do. He said either culinary arts or sports science but again, he was not sure. I offered to arrange internships for him so he would be in a better position to decide.

He also spoke to his section head of Mechanical Engineering at ITE. He knew he really enjoyed his work as a chef and had fun in the kitchen. But he also considered the cost of sacrificing and throwing away everything he had learnt in the two years. So, after much thought, he decided to continue with engineering and not to discard what he has learnt. Cooking remains a passion for him but he wants to have something which builds on his engineering background as a career. And if his passion for culinary arts is still strong, he may go back to it later in life. I suppose he can use the SkillsFuture credits.",13,387,012-002-093-011-004-387,597

These courses would offer the prospect of interesting, practical and stable jobs and they allow him to leverage his mechanical engineering skills foundation, yet explore new areas. However, his internship at PS CafÃ© provided him with valuable experience and he now has the option of revisiting culinary arts at a later stage if he wants. But the most important part about this story is that the advice, guidance, and the internship empowered Daniel to make an informed choice, that was his own decision.

As business expanded, he realised he needed other skills. So between 1992 and 1995, he took up management courses at the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. And at the same time, electronics was booming. He saw the opportunity but realised he did not have the skills. So between 1995 and 1999, he took electronics courses at ITE.",24,398,012-002-093-011-004-398,608

Undeterred, he modified his business plan to ride out the crisis. He changed his business focus, from installing pumps, to maintenance of pumps – a more shock-proof business model. To equip himself for this new direction, he then took courses in plumbing from 1999 to 2002 and air-conditioning from 2002 to 2005. Not content with this, from 2003 to 2004, he became a licensed plumber.

During the sports festival, we can give students opportunities to try their hand at the various sports and games. If a child takes a liking to a particular sport during such a try-out, the school can link up with external providers such as ActiveSG and various community centre groups, to deepen his or her interest in the sport.

We aim to tailor our support measures to the specific needs of students, such as access arrangements for students with dyslexia, orientation of training facilities for students with ASD, and additional assistance in classroom learning for students with ADHD.

2015-03-06,Head K – Ministry of Education,012-002-093-011-004,Ms Sim Ann,"  Regarding affordability, we know that parents of children with SEN are more likely to face additional financial outlay and that is why it is so important to help them with affordability. MOE therefore provides substantial financial support. We have extended various schemes to our SPED schools over the years, including the Edusave Scheme, the SPED Financial Assistance Scheme(FAS), and the School Breakfast Programme.",1,507,012-002-093-011-004-507,717

Shaherah aspires to be a chef, and will be taking the ITE Skills Certificate (ISC) in Baking Practice. Shaherah does not need to pay for the assessments for ISC Type 1 and Type 3 modules over the next two years. If she wishes to improve her mastery of baking, she will not need to pay for the assessments for the Type 2 and Type 4 modules subsequently.

Dr Benedict Tan had suggested that all students should play a sport during Sports Day. Sports Day is one of many opportunities for student participation. Besides Sports Day, schools provide a wide range of sporting experiences for all students throughout the year, such as inter-class and inter-house games, cross-country meets, Sports Carnival, and the Sports Education Programme.",3,527,012-002-093-011-004-527,737

About a third of all our students participate in Sports CCAs, of which 60% are non-school team players.

More importantly, we need to help them develop into people of good character, capable of making sound decisions, and facing challenges with resilience and adaptability.

This can be done through Education and Career Guidance (ECG) for their children. While MOE will provide secondary schools, junior colleges, centralised institutes, polytechnics and the Institutes of Technical Education with ECG counsellors, parents must do their part to really get to know their children. This means spending quality time with them to help them explore different opportunities and possibilities for themselves.",35,559,012-002-093-011-004-559,769

These resources provide parents with tips on how they can guide and assist their children in making mature decisions about their future. There is also information on the various educational pathways, and guiding questions and self-profiling tools to help students make informed choices based on their interests, strengths and values.",36,560,012-002-093-011-004-560,770

Can the Minister share the Government's position on the suggestions by several MPs for the waiver of examination fees to be given to every Singaporean student, even though they are in private schools like the full time madrasahs, and whether this suggestion will be considered by the Government in this year's Budget?",2,567,012-002-093-011-004-567,777
2015-03-06,Head K – Ministry of Education,012-002-093-011-004,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"  Madam, all Singaporeans taking the national examinations as private candidates, including Madrasah students, currently already receive a subsidy on their exam fees. And indeed, our education system is inclusive. And as I have said, and I stand by what I have said – no child will be left behind. All parents can choose to enrol their children in mainstream schools to receive a heavily subsidised education, which now includes full waiver of national exam fees. So our policy remains that we want all our Singaporean children to enrol in our mainstream schools, to go through a common educational experience and grow up together. Therefore, it is not about the equalisation of all conditions between mainstream schools and private schools. If private schools are necessary for specific reasons, the agency coordinating it will look at their needs in that very specific context.",1,568,012-002-093-011-004-568,778

I hope the concerns and suggestions that we have raised will be brought back to MOE for consideration, because many of us spoke on many topics like outdoor activities and arts. Minister spoke about going beyond grades. The reality is that in many schools, the emphasis on good grades is still very strong, which explains why there is such a strong tuition culture. We may talk about looking beyond grades but the schools do look at grades.",1,569,012-002-093-011-004-569,779

I know the Minister of Finance had already spoken about it. I hope Minister would bring it back, discuss with the Ministry of Finance to see whether can we consider bringing it forward the enhanced subsidies for mid-career Singaporeans.",2,570,012-002-093-011-004-570,780

As I had said in my speech, we need to take this transformation together, as parents, as educators, as school leaders, as employers, as a society at large.

But let me say that many of our courses are already indeed highly subsidised. And as I said, our focus should not just be about the subsidies and the particular courses. When we talk about lifelong learning at the end of the day, it is the utilisation of those skills and learning can take place in many different contexts. The example of U.S versus Japan gives us a very vivid lesson that we got to focus on how to make it work and the technical details can then follow from there.",3,573,012-002-093-011-004-573,783

Madam, I would like to seek two clarifications, one is to seek Minister's thoughts on the integrated 10 year through-train schools. I want to clarify that I do not mean compromising any form of rigour in academics. I really think the rigour of academics and character building must remain so. I just want to seek again the Minister's thoughts on this, since I have been asking several times.",1,574,012-002-093-011-004-574,784

I thought that was very good. There is a number of special needs students who also have comorbidities. They have different conditions, at the same time including dyslexia. So, I would like to seek your opinion on that as well.",2,575,012-002-093-011-004-575,785

One important quality is really about perseverance and really pushing and pushing. We all recall that Ms Phua had filed the adjournment motion some months back. So, let me say at the outset, that in the spirit of what I said, I welcome any form of innovation, and that we have to keep an open mind to possibilities. We have to explore new and better ways of doing things, and therefore, we will look at this with serious consideration.",1,576,012-002-093-011-004-576,786

2015-03-06,Head K – Ministry of Education,012-002-093-011-004,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"In some systems, they have been busy with changing all these and the end result is many of them lament that the education system has lost its rigour, and students are very ill prepared, not to mention the future but even for the present. In other systems, it is driven by so much pressure that they decided that they will abolish the PSLE, ""O"" levels and they have a through-train, not just 10 years, but 12 years all the way.",3,578,012-002-093-011-004-578,788
2015-03-06,Head K – Ministry of Education,012-002-093-011-004,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"For as long as there is only path to success, the pressure will manifest itself at some point. In the systems that I have studied, it manifest itself in two areas  one, how do I get onto that path, so first at the Primary school level, I get into a good Primary school and therefore I can get into a good Secondary school and I can get into a good high school.",4,579,012-002-093-011-004-579,789

And then it goes further down, why not a good nursery, so that I can get into a good kindergarten. A friend of mine had a grandchild who was being assessed at the age of three for entry into one of these nurseries overseas. She said her grandchild had his first failure in life at the age of three because he fell asleep while being assessed. The assessment for the other kids took so long that by the time it came to his turn, it was his usual nap time.",5,580,012-002-093-011-004-580,790

2015-03-06,Head K – Ministry of Education,012-002-093-011-004,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"I recently met a Singaporean who married a lady and in this place, her parents-in-law asked him which University do you come from? And when he gave the answer, he became quite an outcast in the family. So the pressure then exerts itself at two extremes. So I am not saying that through-train is a bad idea. I am saying that what we need to do is to think about what is driving that pressure, and how can we innovate within that.",7,582,012-002-093-011-004-582,792
2015-03-06,Head K – Ministry of Education,012-002-093-011-004,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"About two years back, I met a very thoughtful educator in China. When we were discussing this issue, she said to me that for as long as we think we have this scarcity mentality and we think there is one path to success, then the way we look at life will be something like this  千军万马过一条独木桥. In English, it meant that thousands of horses and soldiers all rushing to cross that one narrow wooden bridge. Would there not be pressure in the system? Would it lead to better education? Certainly, there will be pressure. That is one way of dealing with the problem.",8,583,012-002-093-011-004-583,793
2015-03-06,Head K – Ministry of Education,012-002-093-011-004,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"The other is whether we have an abundance mentality. When we have an abundance mentality, then success is not defined by one pathway, but many pathways. Success in schools, success at work. Many, many different pathways. As I said, back in 1965, when we first became independent, 读书 was an important way to get ahead because that was the biggest skills gap.",9,584,012-002-093-011-004-584,794
2015-03-06,Head K – Ministry of Education,012-002-093-011-004,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"Today, we have enormous changes in our economy, many jobs are being created, requiring very deep skills in every area, and therefore the pathways have multiplied. But our thinking about education and pathways have not kept up with these changes. When we think about the future, it is very important for us not to think about that one lone single wooden bridge, but really building many bridges. Not just wooden bridges, but iron bridges, steel bridges, find different ways of crossing the river, specialised boats, motorised boats, submarines, whatever. And in that way, we can create many more pathways to success and indeed the SkillsFuture fellowship awards, the SkillsFuture Credit, the SkillsFuture Awards and all these modularised courses are really many different ways to empower Singaporeans to create our own pathways, to build our own skills map, so that we can stay relevant. At the same time, we need employers to come onboard to make full use of these skills and in that way, companies can have higher productivity, higher margin, that can then translate into higher wages and create a virtual circle of many more successful pathways. Indeed, some Singaporeans might choose to be self-employed, to be entrepreneurs and again build skills to be successful in those different areas. So really this is the fundamental transformation that we need to make  thinking about success beyond school, but success in many different fields and having this abundance mentality to think of new possibilities, having this inventive, resourceful mindset to think about new ways of doing things. In that regard, let me reiterate that I am always open to good ideas and we must always explore whether there are better ways of doing things. But I want to reiterate the point that at the end of the day, fundamentally, having looked at systems all over the world, I think what we need is that major transformation in the way we think about success, we think about pathways and in the way that we go out to create those pathways.",10,585,012-002-093-011-004-585,795

She reminded me of the fact that our specialists have begun working with our SPED schools on reading and literacy improvements for our students as part of our SPED curriculum framework. If memory serves, I think that this effort actually predates our School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme by a bit.

But on the ground, the reality is that there is increasing pressure on the students to chase good grades given the very competitive system and also the high expectations of parents. I am worried about those who find it hard to cope with stress and become exposed to problems like depression, low self-esteem, who may then be vulnerable to suicidal thoughts.",1,587,012-002-093-011-004-587,797

Indeed, I share the Member's concern that we must look at the socio-emotional competencies of our students. Over the last few years in particular, we have strengthened the learning of socio-emotional competencies in our schools through a variety of programmes that is incorporated in the syllabus. At the same time, as Senior Parliamentary Secretary Hawazi has emphasised, at the end of the day, parents play a very, very important role. The communications between parents and their children is critical.",1,589,012-002-093-011-004-589,799

I have met some of these groups. I have been very impressed by what they do because when parents are able to share what each of them is going through, it creates a certain sense of community that we are in this together. This will be a work that will always have to go on, and we have to watch the socio-emotional health of our children so that they grow up to be well-adjusted, happy individuals, and very much like what I said in my speech about learning for life and not just learning for grades.",2,590,012-002-093-011-004-590,800

The Minister has said that these changes he spoke about go beyond schools.",1,591,012-002-093-011-004-591,801
2015-03-06,Head K – Ministry of Education,012-002-093-011-004,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"First, surely the Minister will agree that we will still need the school to implement the changes that we want and there may be some historical structures that may give a different message to what the Minister has said. For example, centralised GEP gives a certain elite status to the nine selected schools and will continue this perception in parents that these are the top and popular schools. So, should we be bold to critically examine historical systems that may have served their purposes and there may be different ways to achieve what it was set up for?",2,592,012-002-093-011-004-592,802
2015-03-06,Head K – Ministry of Education,012-002-093-011-004,Mr Yee Jenn Jong,"My second has been asked but I will ask it in a different way to be persistent. Would the Minister agree that the integrated primary to secondary schools will actually go very well with the Minister's own message that learning is not just for grades but for curiosity and mastery? It will give parents to truly buy into the Minister's message this option to subscribe for such schools so that they do not need to have the children chase for top grades in PSLE to get into the good schools. I have heard what the Minister said, but I feel that we can actually exclude the top schools from this exercise and leave them the original pathways unchanged so that we do not transfer that pressure downwards, as the Minister has just said.",3,593,012-002-093-011-004-593,803
2015-03-06,Head K – Ministry of Education,012-002-093-011-004,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"  I thank Mr Yee for first agreeing wholeheartedly with me about learning for mastery. He raised two questions. First, I talked about beyond school, but what are we doing in school? Indeed, I think when I spoke about going beyond school, when I used the word ""beyond"", what I mean is that you need to do things in school and you then need to go beyond that. So, it is not ""either or"". It is that you need to do both, and do both well.",1,594,012-002-093-011-004-594,804

The point that I have made in my speech is that we have now a variety of Applied Learning Programmes. But I want to go beyond this discussion about whether one or two GEP programmes is creating all this stress and problems; to go beyond that and think about how, in a very big school system like ours where we have about 180 secondary schools, that we can create opportunities in every school. And I am very committed to this ""Every School A Good School"" movement. That is why I have introduced the Applied Learning Programme and the Learning for Life Programme. This is beginning to have its effects and parents are beginning to see that each of these schools offers something interesting or special that can help their children learn.",2,595,012-002-093-011-004-595,805
2015-03-06,Head K – Ministry of Education,012-002-093-011-004,Mr Heng Swee Keat,"I mentioned in my speech the example of Damai Secondary School and how one parent had three of her kids in this Health Sciences programme. So, it is to have this abundance mentality to think about how we can create new possibilities, rather than to focus on one or two specific areas. That we really want to work across a very broad front, to create the multiple paths of success that I spoke about.",3,596,012-002-093-011-004-596,806

Again, I mentioned in my reply to Ms Denise Phua that, at the end of the day (and we have just spoken for over four hours on how important it is for our society to make this major transformation), what is the central focus of our efforts? The central focus of our efforts over the next many years is to create this transformation in our mindsets by everyone, in order to make this very major change possible. So, as I said, I am open to considering what might be the merits of particular ideas and particular things that we could do. But I also need to be very clear that with the resources that we have, and the attention that we have, that I focus it on what will make the biggest impact. So, if we are convinced that, indeed, creating the through-train schools can make the impact, again let me repeat, I am open to considering it. But I have spent a lot of time thinking about these issues, studying systems all over the world, discussing with educators all over the world, and trying to understand what is driving the behaviour of education and social systems all around the world.

The scenes of what happened in Little India on 8 December 2013 also drove home the point that there are, indeed, physical and social limits as to how many foreign workers we can accommodate on this tiny island. Besides, we cannot perpetually depend on additional foreign workers to fuel our growth as there is no guarantee that suitable low-cost foreign labour will always be available for us to bring in.

In the horizon, there are possible events that could pose as shocks to the economy such as the sudden drop in the overall global demand, the sharply rising interest rates, and the potential geopolitical hotspots. While I support the need to have dependency ratio ceilings for each sector to control the total number of foreign workforce, we should keep the option open for adjustments of the levies should there be adverse changes to the external environment or there might be a sharply rising business cost where we need to mitigate. Hence, I am glad that the Finance Minister has deferred the impending final increase of the foreign workers levy.

This is because, seven years after the Global Financial Crisis struck, the world is still affected by the aftershocks of the crisis. The recovery has been uneven and relatively weak and we can expect this sluggish global environment to persist for some time to come.",2,101,012-002-093-011-005-101,923
2015-03-06,Head V – Ministry of Trade and Industry,012-002-093-011-005,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),"But if we step back and review how Singapore has fared over the Global Financial Crisis, in fact, we have performed relatively well.

2015-03-06,Head V – Ministry of Trade and Industry,012-002-093-011-005,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"  While the charts are being distributed, let me explain the intent of the charts. The charts will compare our performance in GDP growth, employment and median income growth. These are our KPIs showing how our overall economy is doing, whether there are enough jobs for our people and how well our workers are being paid. For comparison, I have selected two sets of countries. The first set comprises the advanced economies, that is, US, EU and Japan. And the second set comprises key Asian economies.",1,104,012-002-093-011-005-104,926
2015-03-06,Head V – Ministry of Trade and Industry,012-002-093-011-005,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"So, if you look at the first set of charts, in terms of GDP growth, Singapore has grown by 4.7% annually since 2007. (Refer to Annex A.) As the charts show, we outperformed both the developed economies as well as the key Asian economies.",2,105,012-002-093-011-005-105,927

This was so even at the depth of the global financial crisis. Since 2008, we have created approximately 112,000 jobs every year. More importantly, over two-thirds of the jobs created in the resident workforce were professional, managerial, executive and technical (PMET) jobs.",3,106,012-002-093-011-005-106,928

2015-03-06,Head V – Ministry of Trade and Industry,012-002-093-011-005,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Mr Chairman, as our economy matures, we will need to get used to a lower but more sustainable rate of growth. In addition, our tight labour market is a continuing reality. These domestic challenges will also affect our growth trajectory. But as the numbers show, our efforts in the past few years have put us on the right track and we are making progress despite significant headwinds. Against this backdrop, we can expect Singapore's economy to grow between 2% and 4% in 2015.",5,108,012-002-093-011-005-108,930
2015-03-06,Head V – Ministry of Trade and Industry,012-002-093-011-005,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Mr Liang has also asked for the outlook for growth in ASEAN, and how this will affect Singapore in the lead-up to the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) this year. ASEAN is expected to achieve a growth rate of 5.6% per year between 2015 and 2019. If ASEAN continues on this trajectory, ASEAN could become the fourth largest single market by 2030, after the European Union, the US and China. We must therefore position ourselves to take advantage of the opportunities that deeper integration through the AEC will bring, and indeed, we have been actively engaging businesses to do so.",6,109,012-002-093-011-005-109,931
2015-03-06,Head V – Ministry of Trade and Industry,012-002-093-011-005,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"To achieve the growth of between 2% and 4%, Mr Liang, Ms Jessica Tan, and Mr Gan Thiam Poh have asked what our key growth sectors and key growth opportunities will be in the years ahead. Mr Chair, our economy is well-diversified. Previously, we highlighted the Asia growth story. The prospects of an increasingly integrated ASEAN remain positive. In our projections, manufacturing will continue to be an important part of our growth story. The manufacturing sector has achieved steady value-added (VA) growth of 4.3% per year since 2007. And this was achieved while keeping the labour force in the manufacturing sector approximately constant. In 2008, the manufacturing sector employed a total of 565,000 people. In 2014, this was 536,000. We will continue to move up the value chain into advanced technology and high-value areas, as well as to seek productivity improvements in existing sectors.",7,110,012-002-093-011-005-110,932
2015-03-06,Head V – Ministry of Trade and Industry,012-002-093-011-005,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Our achievement has been underpinned by a steady pipeline of projects that we have secured across our manufacturing clusters. Three days ago, I attended the ground-breaking ceremony for the expansion of Micron Technology's NAND flash memory wafer fab. This will be Micron's largest and most advanced wafer fab location in the world. It entails an investment of US$4 billion. When fully operational, it will create about 500 highly skilled jobs. Last November, I was at the opening of Amgen Singapore's biologics manufacturing facility. This facility is Singapore's ninth world-class biologics manufacturing plant, and the first in the world to use Amgen's latest proprietary technologies and manufacturing processes on a commercial scale. Each biologics plant will create 100 to 200 highly skilled jobs.",8,111,012-002-093-011-005-111,933
2015-03-06,Head V – Ministry of Trade and Industry,012-002-093-011-005,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"Cutting-edge projects like these will keep us at the forefront of global manufacturing. Our steady pipeline of investments will keep us in the game for the next five years. To remain competitive in the longer run, we will have to adopt disruptive technologies such as 3D printing and advanced robotics, something that Mr Gan Thiam Poh also raised. This will enable us to create new business models and take advantage of new opportunities.",9,112,012-002-093-011-005-112,934
2015-03-06,Head V – Ministry of Trade and Industry,012-002-093-011-005,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"For example, rapid prototyping through 3D printing enables faster innovation, helping companies bring their products to market faster while using resources more efficiently, which would not be possible using traditional manufacturing techniques. 3D printing enables more cost-effective small-volume production, enabling new business models which rely on mass customisation, such as the Consumer-to-Business (C2B) model as well as the personalisation of goods like running shoes tailor-made for the individual. In addition, 3D printing could disrupt established supply chains as it erodes the competitive advantage traditionally held by mass production, and enables the emergence of efficient, yet small-scale domestic production hubs. So, one can argue that 3D printing and advanced robotics have the potential to disrupt the competitive landscape. Smaller niche players can now take on the bigger players.",10,113,012-002-093-011-005-113,935

The evolution of the manufacturing sector will create jobs which require new competencies such as data analytics, engineering, and operations expertise. For instance, technicians in a wafer fab will require analytics and operations skills to monitor production output and quality, and advanced robotics capabilities to troubleshoot and repair the robots which will take on the lower value tasks.",11,114,012-002-093-011-005-114,936

This is one key reason why we will provide greater support for collaboration between large enterprises and SMEs through the Partnerships for Capability Transformation (PACT) programme. We introduced PACT in 2010 to help SMEs build up their capabilities and track record. The scheme was expanded in 2013 to cover new industries as well as to include new forms of collaboration. It now provides support for supplier qualification, test-bedding of innovative solutions, knowledge transfer, and productivity improvements.",12,115,012-002-093-011-005-115,937

PACT will cover a broader spectrum of co-innovation to include joint product development at the proof-of-concept stage. This will provide greater support for co-innovation between SMEs and the large enterprises, and help local contract manufacturers upgrade to supply higher-technology components.",13,116,012-002-093-011-005-116,938
2015-03-06,Head V – Ministry of Trade and Industry,012-002-093-011-005,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"In addition, to enable more projects to qualify for support, PACT will now be able to support SMEs even if the partner large enterprise does not receive funding – so long as the large enterprise is committed to develop the local company's capabilities.",14,117,012-002-093-011-005-117,939
2015-03-06,Head V – Ministry of Trade and Industry,012-002-093-011-005,Mr Lim Hng Kiang,"We will also improve and enhance the Capability Development Grant (CDG). The CDG is a flexible grant that can be customised for each individual SME. SMEs can choose to defray up to 70% of the project costs in ten areas ranging from technology innovation, to intellectual property and franchising. It has been well received, and has supported over 1,200 projects in 2014. We will be extending the enhanced support under the CDG, so that companies can continue to get 70% support till 2018. We will also simplify the application process for projects under $30,000, so that smaller companies can access this grant more easily.",15,118,012-002-093-011-005-118,940

Since 2007, our services exports have grown by 6.9% per year. In terms of the value of our services exports, Singapore now ranks 11th in the world and fourth in Asia. Despite keen competition from the bigger economies, we have been gaining market share of global services exports. Take our trade in services with China as an example. We are in fact now China's third largest foreign trading partner for services after the United States and Japan. So, for a small economy like us, we have in fact gone up the ladder, and we are now China's third largest foreign trading partner for services just after the United States and Japan.",18,121,012-002-093-011-005-121,943

Last year, EMA, the Energy Market Authority, put in place a competitive process to secure new LNG supplies for Singapore, and launched a two-stage Request-for-Proposal (RFP) to supply Singapore's next tranche of LNG. There has been a strong response to Stage One of the RFP. We have received nine competitive bids proposing a variety of LNG supply solutions and price indices. And they collectively proposed more than 10 new source countries from which Singapore's next tranche of LNG may be secured. So, it has gone significantly towards meeting our objective of diversifying our sources and giving us greater resilience in our energy supplies. Our agencies are evaluating the bids and will announce the outcome in due course.",21,163,012-002-093-011-005-163,985

Mr Ong Teng Koon asked about the progress of Singapore's LNG infrastructure and our plans. The commencement of our terminal's operations in May 2013 has allowed us to import LNG from literally all over the world. When additional regasification facilities are completed in 2017, the terminal's throughput capacity will be increased substantially from 6 Mtpa (million tonnes per annum) to 11 Mtpa and that is a significant increase which will go a long way towards addressing Singapore's long term energy needs.

2015-03-06,Head V – Ministry of Trade and Industry,012-002-093-011-005,Mr Heng Chee How (Whampoa),"  Mr Chairman, productivity of the Singapore economy has been lacklustre, after a spurt following the global financial crisis in 2009, 2010, when excess capacity within the economy was taken up. I find that to be worrying. Why? Because countries that may be less productive and cheaper than us, have been improving, so they are catching up on us.

I would like to ask MTI for an update on the work of the NPC. We have heard much about what we are going to do about SkillsFuture, but I think it is important for us also to pay the attention of the NPC, and how that is translating into outcomes within the different sectors of our economy. Also, what lessons can we learn from other countries as they also try to improve their processes and their productivity, especially the developed countries, and how can we learn from their example.",3,194,012-002-093-011-005-194,1016

MTI should also work out secondary measurements that are better defined and more tangibly understood by the sectors. These could be things like target wages or value-add per skilled or unskilled workers, foreign worker or local worker. Or certain targets at the sector level.

Such sectors, for example, manufacturing, finance and insurance, and wholesale trade, are characterised by businesses which compete internationally. For them, being productive is essential to compete on a global scale. In contrast, productivity in domestic-oriented sectors such as construction, retail and food services has grown by less than 1%.",1,248,012-002-093-011-005-248,1070
