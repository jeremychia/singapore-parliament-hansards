2020-10-05,President's Address,014-001-095-007-001,Mr Speaker,  Order. I have to inform hon Members that I have on 7 September 2020 communicated to the President the Address of Thanks agreed to by resolution of this Parliament on 4 September 2020.,1,1,014-001-095-007-001-001,1
2020-10-05,Timeline for Universities and Schools to Return to Normalised Face-to-face Classes,014-001-095-007-002,Ms Foo Mee Har,asked the Minister for Education whether the Ministry will consider allowing Universities and schools to return to more normalised face-to-face activities and classes when TraceTogether tokens are in widespread use with safe distancing measures in place.,1,1,014-001-095-007-002-001,2
2020-10-05,Timeline for Universities and Schools to Return to Normalised Face-to-face Classes,014-001-095-007-002,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"  Mr Speaker, students from all levels have resumed daily lessons in our schools. Lower-risk co-curricular activities or CCAs and other activities have also resumed. Likewise, the Institutes of Higher Learning or IHLs have gradually increased the number of students allowed back on campus for practicums, laboratory sessions and other classes. They are progressively allowing selected non-timetabled activities to return to campus, including project discussions and some student activities.",1,2,014-001-095-007-002-002,3
2020-10-05,Timeline for Universities and Schools to Return to Normalised Face-to-face Classes,014-001-095-007-002,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"We now have effective Safe Management Measures in place in our schools and IHLs, coupled with a system of rapid contact tracing. We have also improved capabilities to detect community cases quickly through our expanded testing regime and are exploring the monitoring of wastewater in student hostels.",2,3,014-001-095-007-002-003,4
2020-10-05,Timeline for Universities and Schools to Return to Normalised Face-to-face Classes,014-001-095-007-002,The Minister for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong),"With these conditions in place, we are now studying ways to resume more in-person activities safely in our schools and IHLs, as the Member has suggested. These activities, together with the resumption of a wider range of CCAs and other activities, are important because we must strive to provide our students with a holistic educational experience, while keeping risks to a manageable level. MOE is working through the details and will share more in due course.",3,4,014-001-095-007-002-004,5
2020-10-05,Measures to Ease Singapore into Further Re-opening after COVID-19 Circuit Breaker,014-001-095-007-003,Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo,"asked the Minister for Health with the low number of community cases for COVID-19, what can be expected on further easing of measures for Singapore and when can this be done.",1,1,014-001-095-007-003-001,6
2020-10-05,Measures to Ease Singapore into Further Re-opening after COVID-19 Circuit Breaker,014-001-095-007-003,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis,asked the Minister for Health whether the Government has completed its review of work-from-home arrangements and where does Singapore stand in the Government's risk assessment in determining when to move into Phase 3 of Singapore's re-opening.,1,2,014-001-095-007-003-002,7
2020-10-05,Measures to Ease Singapore into Further Re-opening after COVID-19 Circuit Breaker,014-001-095-007-003,The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong),"  Mr Speaker, may I take Question Nos 2 and 3 together?",1,3,014-001-095-007-003-003,8
2020-10-05,Measures to Ease Singapore into Further Re-opening after COVID-19 Circuit Breaker,014-001-095-007-003,Mr Speaker,"  Yes, please.",1,4,014-001-095-007-003-004,9
2020-10-05,Measures to Ease Singapore into Further Re-opening after COVID-19 Circuit Breaker,014-001-095-007-003,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"  Thank you. Sir, when Singapore exited the circuit breaker period in June 2020, the Multi-Ministry Task Force or MTF set out a Three-phase Plan to resume economic and social activities. Since then, we have progressed from Phase One to Phase Two.",1,5,014-001-095-007-003-005,10
2020-10-05,Measures to Ease Singapore into Further Re-opening after COVID-19 Circuit Breaker,014-001-095-007-003,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We have learned important lessons from other countries in easing precautionary measures for COVID-19. For example, when restrictions are lifted prematurely, or too hastily, a resurgence of cases may occur, resulting in the need to partially reimpose these restrictions. On the other hand, it is not sustainable to maintain tight restrictions for a prolonged period which will severely impact not only our economy, but also our lives. Therefore, we have taken a carefully calibrated approach in opening up our society and economy as we work towards Phase Three. This is complemented by close monitoring, extensive testing and comprehensive contact tracing to keep the situation under control, as we balance the protection of lives and livelihoods.",2,6,014-001-095-007-003-006,11
2020-10-05,Measures to Ease Singapore into Further Re-opening after COVID-19 Circuit Breaker,014-001-095-007-003,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We have made significant moves towards restoring economic and social activities. From 28 September 2020, we allowed more employees who have been working from home to return to their workplaces, which Mr Louis Chua had asked about. However, we need to continue to keep our workplaces safe and minimise crowding. Therefore, such employees should still continue to work from home for at least half their working time and there should be no more than 50% of such employees at the workplace at any point in time. Work-related events, including conferences, seminars and meetings, have also been allowed to resume, albeit within a 50-person cap for these activities to reduce the risk of transmission. Other safe management measures should continue to be observed at workplaces.",3,7,014-001-095-007-003-007,12
2020-10-05,Measures to Ease Singapore into Further Re-opening after COVID-19 Circuit Breaker,014-001-095-007-003,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We have also taken steps to support the resumption of a few very targeted and specific areas. We recognise the importance of key life events such as weddings and the importance of religious activities and worship to our spiritual needs. Therefore, we have allowed greater numbers of up to 100 persons to attend each of these events, in multiple zones or time slots of at most 50 persons each to limit potential risk exposure. Earlier, we had also allowed the resumption of physical exercise classes in common community spaces, and allowed an increase in capacity for cinemas and leisure attractions such as the Zoo and Bird Park. Museums and libraries have also re-opened. We are piloting live performances to prepare us to eventually be able to resume such activities safely.",4,8,014-001-095-007-003-008,13
2020-10-05,Measures to Ease Singapore into Further Re-opening after COVID-19 Circuit Breaker,014-001-095-007-003,Mr Gan Kim Yong,Ms Jessica Tan has asked what can be expected on further easing of measures going forward and when this can be done; and I understand Ms Foo Mee Har would like to know whether the social and dining group size limit of five persons will be reviewed. All these are very important questions that we ask ourselves constantly.,5,9,014-001-095-007-003-009,14
2020-10-05,Measures to Ease Singapore into Further Re-opening after COVID-19 Circuit Breaker,014-001-095-007-003,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Sir, if all of us continue to work together and keep our guard up even as more activities resume, we will be able to keep the pandemic under control and progress towards further opening up our economy and society steadily. For instance, we could allow for general group sizes larger than five, so that larger families or groups of friends could meet and have meals together. We are particularly concerned about dining as we need to remove our masks so as to eat and drink, but we tend to also talk at the same time. The risk is considerably higher than activities which we can keep our masks on and maintain a safe distance.",6,10,014-001-095-007-003-010,15
2020-10-05,Measures to Ease Singapore into Further Re-opening after COVID-19 Circuit Breaker,014-001-095-007-003,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"We have begun pilots of events and activities with a larger number of attendees, such as trade exhibitions, conferences and religious worship to assess whether we can maintain effective precautions and safe distancing measures. If these pilots are successful, we will be able to use the lessons learnt to allow more large-scale events to proceed. We will also continue to facilitate further opening up for overseas travel in a safe and calibrated manner, which Minister Ong Ye Kung will talk about later in greater detail later.",7,11,014-001-095-007-003-011,16
2020-10-05,Measures to Ease Singapore into Further Re-opening after COVID-19 Circuit Breaker,014-001-095-007-003,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"The low number of community cases currently is not accidental but has come about due to our collective hard work and sacrifices. Even as we move towards Phase Three, the new normal will be different from what we were used to in the pre-COVID days. The MTF is working on a road map towards Phase Three and we will share more details when we are ready in the coming weeks.",8,12,014-001-095-007-003-012,17
2020-10-05,Measures to Ease Singapore into Further Re-opening after COVID-19 Circuit Breaker,014-001-095-007-003,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"As overseas travel restrictions are progressively eased and more activities resume, it has become even more critical that each of us plays our part to exercise social responsibility and adhere to the safe management measures, in order to keep our family and friends safe as we progress towards Phase Three.",9,13,014-001-095-007-003-013,18
2020-10-05,Measures to Ease Singapore into Further Re-opening after COVID-19 Circuit Breaker,014-001-095-007-003,Mr Speaker,  Mr Louis Ng.,1,14,014-001-095-007-003-014,19
2020-10-05,Measures to Ease Singapore into Further Re-opening after COVID-19 Circuit Breaker,014-001-095-007-003,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"  Thank you, Sir. I thank the Minister for the response. I note that we are now at about 50% of our work-from-home policy, but I think Minister Lawrence Wong originally said that we should embrace working from home even after the circuit breaker ends. So, can I just check whether the Government still stands by that statement?",1,15,014-001-095-007-003-015,20
2020-10-05,Measures to Ease Singapore into Further Re-opening after COVID-19 Circuit Breaker,014-001-095-007-003,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Second, I think working from home has allowed more fathers to play an active role in child care-giving duties. I am just wondering whether the Government has studies or will be studying whether our work-from-home policies can contribute towards levelling the child care-giving duties at home and hence, tackling this gender stereotype?",2,16,014-001-095-007-003-016,21
2020-10-05,Measures to Ease Singapore into Further Re-opening after COVID-19 Circuit Breaker,014-001-095-007-003,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"  I thank the Member. Let me answer the first question. Working from home will continue to be default, but we do accept and acknowledge that there are challenges both from the employers as well as from the employees' perspective. Some employees' homes may not be conducive for working from home. Therefore, we made some arrangements and provided flexibility to allow the employers and the employees to work out better, more flexible arrangements, but subject to the criteria that I have just mentioned – no more than 50% of all employees who are working from home today, can go back to the office; and for those who are working from home today, not more than half of their time should be spent in the workplace; and they should still continue to work from home if they can.",1,17,014-001-095-007-003-017,22
2020-10-05,Measures to Ease Singapore into Further Re-opening after COVID-19 Circuit Breaker,014-001-095-007-003,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"It is a flexible arrangement; we want to provide some flexibility for the workers and the employers. We also recognise that some employers do need to consult their employees, they still need to have face-to-face interactions and meetings. This is also part of the process of team bonding and is critical among the employees. We cannot totally do away with the face-to-face, physical meetings and interactions amongst employees and employers. So, we provide some flexibility but we still encourage employers and employees to work out the arrangements and to allow employees to stay at home, work from home, as much as possible. This will help to reduce overcrowding in the workplaces and at the same time, also reduce the congestion on the roads and on public transport. These are important.",2,18,014-001-095-007-003-018,23
2020-10-05,Measures to Ease Singapore into Further Re-opening after COVID-19 Circuit Breaker,014-001-095-007-003,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"As I had mentioned in my reply, even after the COVID-19 pandemic is over, whenever that happens, we will continue to encourage this flexible working arrangement. Through this period of COVID-19, we have found that working from home has a lot of advantages, like Mr Louis Ng has mentioned. You can spend more time with your family and fathers can also play a bigger role in the family setting. But this is a separate issue on family matters, which is probably more appropriate for the Member to file a separate Parliamentary Question (PQ) addressed to MSF, rather than for MOH to respond specifically.",3,19,014-001-095-007-003-019,24
2020-10-05,Measures to Ease Singapore into Further Re-opening after COVID-19 Circuit Breaker,014-001-095-007-003,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"But generally, we will continue to encourage working from home and we will continue to provide flexibility to allow flexible work arrangements between the employer and the employees.",4,20,014-001-095-007-003-020,25
2020-10-05,Measures to Ease Singapore into Further Re-opening after COVID-19 Circuit Breaker,014-001-095-007-003,Mr Speaker,"  A reminder to Members to keep the supplementary questions relevant to the PQs, please. Mr Louis Chua.",1,21,014-001-095-007-003-021,26
2020-10-05,Measures to Ease Singapore into Further Re-opening after COVID-19 Circuit Breaker,014-001-095-007-003,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"  I thank the Minister for the detailed explanation. Specific to the roadmap that Minister had mentioned that he would be sharing over the next couple weeks, may I ask, firstly, if there will be additional parameters or guidance given to businesses and individuals such that they will be able to make their planning in advance? For example, earlier, we allowed up to 50% of the employees to work from the office, but I think that was only given five days in advance of the 28 September date.",1,22,014-001-095-007-003-022,27
2020-10-05,Measures to Ease Singapore into Further Re-opening after COVID-19 Circuit Breaker,014-001-095-007-003,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"The other matter is in relation to my question on the Government's risk assessment. One specific measure would be relating to the DORSCON status. I note that we have been in DORSCON Orange since 7 February earlier this year, and remain in DORSCON Orange today, even though the number of cases has gone from about more than 1,000 a day, to right now, less than 10. Is that something which the Government will review in order to provide us with a more handy reference guide in terms of where we stand in the risk assessment?",2,23,014-001-095-007-003-023,28
2020-10-05,Measures to Ease Singapore into Further Re-opening after COVID-19 Circuit Breaker,014-001-095-007-003,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"  I thank the Member. This is a very important question. So, I thank him for the opportunity to explain and elaborate. For employment practices, we are working very closely with MOM and MTI to engage the various stakeholders. Because different sectors will have different challenges and we are working through these challenges with them. You would have noticed that for some of the announcements, the notice period is very short, basically because there is really no need to meet any deadline. For example, when you allow workers to go back to work – you can start on Monday, you can start next week, you can start next month. It is not a requirement that you must get them to go back to work and therefore, there is really no need for a lead time to prepare. You can take as long as you need to prepare yourselves, to discuss with your employees how to introduce this flexible arrangement. So, it is an on-going process.",1,24,014-001-095-007-003-024,29
2020-10-05,Measures to Ease Singapore into Further Re-opening after COVID-19 Circuit Breaker,014-001-095-007-003,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In fact, many of the measures, you would notice, we do not accumulate them into a big package and then announce them at once, so that there are many changes at one go. We work with the sector leads to discuss how to help them, how to solve some of the challenges. As and when these issues are addressed and solved, we move ahead. Some of them may not even require a specific public announcement because it may be very sector-specific and so we would just discuss with the sector. When we come to some common understanding to make sure that safe management measures can be put in place, and we proceed with it.",2,25,014-001-095-007-003-025,30

2020-10-05,Measures to Ease Singapore into Further Re-opening after COVID-19 Circuit Breaker,014-001-095-007-003,,"With regard to the DORSCON level, we have to always bear in mind that, as I have mentioned before, DORSCON level is not just determined by the number of cases alone. At this moment, particularly, we have to be very mindful that while the number of cases in Singapore is low, the cases around us, in other parts of the world, are still rising. Therefore, we cannot let our guards down. I will continue to maintain DORSCON Orange for the time being until we are quite confident that the global situation is under control.",3,28,014-001-095-007-003-028,33

We will need to continue to encourage more travels because Singapore is a hub city. So, we need to ensure that our travel hub and business hub status do not get undermined. I should not go into too much detail on this because Minister Ong Ye Kung is all ready to speak on this. I will leave it to him to elaborate. Suffice to say that until the world is safe, we will not be safe. Therefore, we have to continue to maintain the DORSCON level and to keep our guards up, so that we can continue to keep the number of cases low, especially in the community.",4,29,014-001-095-007-003-029,34

In relation to the issue about the disciplinary proceedings that has been commenced by Ms Parti Liyani – this was something that happened subsequent to the filing of my PQ. So, if it carries on, I wonder whether the hon Minister anticipates that he would be in a position to deal with the case and make the Statement in November 2020, if there is a prospect that leave be given for disciplinary proceedings to carry on which as the hon Minister would know, would involve the Court, and there could be a notion of sub judice in those circumstances.",1,19,014-001-095-007-004-019,53

Mr Speaker, Sir, I declare that I am the Director with the NTUC ARU unit. Usually, an employment agreement ties an employer with an employee legally. So, in this case, I understand that for Ms Parti Liyani, warning letters were issued to Mrs Liew as well as to Mr Karl Liew who were not her employers.

I thank the Minister of State for the reply as well. I understand that the foreign domestic workers or FDWs can be deployed outside their registered address if they are looking after the young children and the senior parents or the elderly parents of the employers.

The answer is yes. Currently, employers are required to notify MOM, if they intend to deploy their foreign domestic workers to an address that is different from what is stated in the work permit, particularly if they require the foreign domestic worker to take care of their charges such as young children or the elderly at a relative's home.

My question is  will LTA or MOT be willing to explore doing reviews just like what was done by the state of Queensland, Australia, for example, where they did an Improving Bus Drivers' Safety Review in 2018? They came up with a few measures introduced in 2018, including anti-shatter films, driver barriers and also a release of a code of conduct for passengers in the middle of 2018. They also ran a public awareness campaign from June to December 2018. So, my question is whether LTA or MOT will be willing to explore such a review and encourage best practices between our multiple bus operators?

This suggestion from the unions is currently being discussed with the operators. We would also take feedback from our bus captains because they are the ones who will be using this. When this safeguard is in place, they will be the ones who are going to use it daily. I think an important consideration when we ask the bus captains for their feedback, will be to ensure that the installation of these protective shields will not interfere with the safety when they are driving the buses. I think that is a very key consideration. We will also get their feedback, because I think previously the trials showed that when you put some of these protective shields in place, there was a bit of glare that affected the drivers, the bus captains. So, we will also have to look at that because, ultimately, this is for both the protection and safety of the bus captains and also for the safety of commuters.",1,17,014-001-095-007-006-017,90

Firstly, with regards to data integrity, data security and protection, indeed, she is right to say that, for the ERP backend system, we will have data to more than some one million or so motorists – specific data.

What we want to do is to ensure a smooth implementation of the next-generation ERP system. The current ERP system is already more than 20 years old, it is reaching its end of its operational life and, in fact, is increasingly difficult and actually very expensive to maintain.

I have two supplementary questions. My first question is about the upcoming industry consultations that the LTA has planned, I would like to ask, what is the scope of this consultation and if the LTA is still open to doing a public consultation on the design of the onboard unit – perhaps for future considerations. Like my fellow colleague, Miss Cheryl Chan have said, a lot of vehicles today already have display panels in the vehicle, can we then find a way to connect the OBU with the display that is already in existence in the vehicle.",1,36,014-001-095-007-007-036,126

In June 2019, when there was an online incident of a supposed design leak, LTA then had responded to state that the pictures were just illustrations used for an earlier study back in 2016. On 17 June last year, LTA stated through a Facebook post that the agency was still testing the equipment for the new ERP system, which has not been finalised. However, we also understand from Senior Minister of State's reply today that the LTA is contractually bound to the current OBU design after the tender award and any design changes would have cost implication.",2,37,014-001-095-007-007-037,127

So, the other one which we are doing and which we have taken feedback on, is of course with regard to the use of the mobile phone as a display screen. So, this is something that we are studying and we are looking to push this out. The Member Miss Cheryl Chan had asked if we do it as early as possible. As I have said, we want a smooth implementation of the nexgen ERP, let the system stabilise, we will look at this and then when it is possible, we will be able to offer it to the motorists and they can replace their display units.

One supplementary question I would like to ask is basically, the tender was awarded in 2016 as we understand. That was four years ago, technology moves very quickly these days. So, I am just wondering what were the tender specifications that basically resulted in us being bound by the design that we committed to four years ago, rather than allowing for flexibility to update that as and when we went along? And whether we will consider this in future tenders and future calls for tender to allow us to have greater flexibility given that technology moves really quickly? And that, we do not inadvertently as in this case, end up incurring costs if we need to change the design as and when with public consultation and when technology moves along.",1,46,014-001-095-007-007-046,136

I understand that they even had a driver trial experiments to look at the safety of the GUI features. We have also got an inter-Ministry committee that we consulted as I have shared earlier. And in fact, we also did two independent reviews on the features, the security features of the OBU.

There was no doubt that the training had been properly carried out but AGO noted that programme partners had not documented how the participants’ previous and current job scopes were different, which is the requirement for the training to be supported under the PCP. WSG has reviewed each of these cases and verified that all 15 participants changed their job scopes and successfully converted into new job roles through their respective PCPs. In addition, to address the AGO's concern about the adequacy of its guidelines, WSG will be developing a new PCP guide for all its programme partners by the end of the year. The document will include guidelines on how career conversion should be consistently assessed, as well as the critical information that programme partners should report to ensure better and consistent monitoring of PCP outcomes.",3,4,014-001-095-007-010-004,161

The programme partners did not collect the complete set of performance indicators required by WSG and also had varying practices in collecting the information. WSG has since reviewed and streamlined its approach. Henceforth, programme partners will focus on the most important outcome indicators, namely, the number of placements and number of participants who completed training, both of which are straightforward to monitor and report.",4,5,014-001-095-007-010-005,162

We place high expectations on the senior leadership of the Public Service, who are entrusted to be stewards of public resources. They must uphold strong governance and accountability in their organisations. These expectations are spelt out in the form of leadership competencies and responsibilities, which are conveyed to all senior Public Service leaders in Ministries and Statutory Boards. We evaluate our leaders against these expectations as part of their performance reviews and those who fall short will be rated less favourably. Depending on the nature and cause of the incident, appropriate disciplinary action may be taken as well.",15,21,014-001-095-007-011-021,203

These proposals were aimed at enhancing our offerings, in the international arbitration arena and they included  the introduction of a default mode of appointment of arbitrators in multi-party situations; recognising that an arbitral tribunal and the High Court ought to have powers to enforce obligations of confidentiality; allowing a party to the arbitral proceedings to appeal to the High Court on a question of law arising out of an award, provided that parties have agreed to opt into this mechanism; and allowing parties to waive or limit the annulment grounds under the Model Law or the IAA.

2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"At present, the IAA provides a procedure for default appointment of arbitrators only where there are only two parties to a dispute; and where these parties have adopted an ad hoc arbitration instead of institutional arbitration or have chosen not to apply institutional arbitration rules. There is currently no similar procedure in the IAA or the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration, for arbitrations where the dispute involves more than two parties.",15,15,014-001-095-007-018-015,454
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"As Members know, today as transactions become more complex, disputes become more complex, multi-party arbitrations have been a growing trend. It is no longer often that we see a case where there is a single claimant with a single respondent. The increasingly complex and diverse nature of contracts means that more often than not, these disputes will be multi-party in nature.",16,16,014-001-095-007-018-016,455
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Where there are multiple parties, they may not be able to collectively agree on an arbitrator. Indeed, it is sometimes not in their interest to do so. A group of claimants will probably find it easier to be aligned, but in some multi-party cases, the interests of the disputing parties are not necessarily aligned neatly into two opposing sides and very often, they are not. As a result, it is not easy for these two groups of parties to agree on who they wish to nominate as their respective arbitrator. Such situations could also occur in disputes arising from multi-shareholder or multi-joint venture party disputes.",17,17,014-001-095-007-018-017,456
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"In one example that was cited to us, the dispute comprised a state, a ministry and joint venture vehicle as the respondent. On the side of the claimants was a consortium of oil companies. The claimants were more easily able to co-ordinate and appoint an arbitrator, but when it came to the respondents, it was a lot more difficult as the different parties comprising the respondent group, comprised different entities with divergent interests. This would result in one side not having the benefit of a party appointed member on the tribunal, through no fault of his except that its interests were not coincident with the rest of the respondent group.",18,18,014-001-095-007-018-018,457
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Other examples include claims by a developer against two contractors, in a situation where each of the contractors might have had a distinct role and each of the contractors might well have a reason for suggesting that the other contractor is at fault. In those situations, you would not expect the respondent parties to be coincident or aligned in terms of their choice of arbitrators.",19,19,014-001-095-007-018-019,458
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),It is also not uncommon for respondents to try to delay or frustrate an arbitration by either failing to appoint an arbitrator or dragging their feet or just not taking part in the proceedings for nomination at all.,20,20,014-001-095-007-018-020,459
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"These examples are just some, but they demonstrate the importance of having clear rules or procedures, upfront, to help parties to quickly resolve their differences, at the procedural stage. This is not a problem where parties have decided on a set of institutional rules, but it does become critical in the context of multi-party ad hoc arbitration situations where there is no agreed mechanism for the constitution of the arbitral tribunal, and where the parties' inability to agree on the appointment of their arbitrators would invariably lead to disagreement and delays in commencing the proceedings. This invariably adds to costs and unnecessary time spent on process and procedure, when the parties really ought to get into the heart of the substance of the dispute and resolve those disputes. We also want to ensure that, as far as possible, all parties receive equal treatment in the formation of the tribunal.",21,21,014-001-095-007-018-021,460
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Sir, to address these concerns, clause 3 of the Bill introduces a new section 9B to the Act, to provide for the default procedure for the appointment of arbitrators in multi-party arbitrations. It will apply where there are three or more parties and three arbitrators. The default procedure will only apply where parties have not agreed on a procedure for the appointment of the arbitrators.",22,22,014-001-095-007-018-022,461
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Let me now take Members briefly through the steps involved in this procedure. The claimant must first appoint an arbitrator on or before the date of its request for arbitration. If there is more than one claimant, then all the claimants should make the appointment by agreement. The claimant or claimants must then inform the respondents of the appointment and state the appointed arbitrator together with the notice of arbitration.",23,23,014-001-095-007-018-023,462
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"The respondent must then appoint an arbitrator after the receipt of the request for arbitration. Again, if there is more than one respondent, all the respondents need to make or agree to the appointment. The respondent must inform the claimant or claimants of the appointment. And finally, the two appointed arbitrators on both sides, will then get together and appoint the third arbitrator, who will be the presiding arbitrator.",24,24,014-001-095-007-018-024,463
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"However, where parties are unable to come to an agreement on their choice of arbitrator, then the new section 9B(2) provides that the appointing authority must then, in that situation and upon the request of any party, appoint all three arbitrators. In doing so, the appointing authority is required to have regard to and I quote, ""all relevant circumstances"". So, a broad discretion, to consider all the facts, all the matters which arise in the context of that appointment exercise is to be considered. 9B(2) also allows for the appointing authority to consider the choices already made by the parties at that stage, if any, and at what stage the proceedings might be at.",25,25,014-001-095-007-018-025,464
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"Let me elaborate a little on this. Under the IAA, where the parties have not agreed on who should be the appointing authority, then the default appointing authority will be the President of the Court of Arbitration of the SIAC and any other person nominated by the Chief Justice to exercise the powers of that appointing authority.",26,26,014-001-095-007-018-026,465
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,The Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai),"In doing so, the appointing authority may have regard to all relevant circumstances as I have mentioned and that authority may reappoint or may revoke any appointment that has already been made. The appointing authority may also designate any one of the three arbitrators as the presiding arbitrator. This process seeks to strike a balance between party autonomy and equality in the arbitration process.

Alternative dispute resolution mechanisms – in particular, mediation and arbitration, are increasingly popular in recent times, with the privacy afforded to parties at such forums.

The complexity of such matters may be exacerbated where there are more than two parties involved in the dispute. The amendments plug the lacuna in the law. With the stipulated procedure on appointment of arbitrators in multi-party arbitrations, this should minimise procedural disputes on the same time, resulting in saved time and costs for parties. We note that there is a growing trend in arbitrations from joint ventures, oil and gas matters, and merger and acquisition disputes – these disputes often involve substantial sums of monies, and there is all the more reason why we want these matters to be arbitrated in Singapore.",8,54,014-001-095-007-018-054,493

2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),The first amendment is to provide for a default mode of appointment for arbitrators in multi-party arbitrations.,3,63,014-001-095-007-018-063,502
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Generally, when an agreement is entered into parties would usually include standard arbitration clauses in those agreements. These clauses would typically provide for tribunals consisting of a sole arbitrator, or sometimes three arbitrators. Where there are three arbitrators to be appointed, the usual method is for the Claimant to appoint one, the Respondent to appoint one and for the two appointed arbitrators to agree on a third. These are general practices, of course, specific clauses may vary. There is typically also a deadlock mechanism. If the two party appointed arbitrators cannot agree on the third, namely that it will be appointed by some third party, usually institution appointed under the arbitration agreement. This could be ICC, for example.",4,64,014-001-095-007-018-064,503
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Where problems arise is if there are more than two adverse parties in an arbitration and all are separately represented. I think the Minister highlighted several examples in his speech. And this is increasingly common in the context of multi-party agreements or in a situation where different agreements are consolidated because we now have rules permitting consolidation of arbitrations. So, in this scenario where you have three parties or more, there is a greater likelihood that parties will not be able to agree upon ""party appointed"" arbitrators. For example, if there are multiple Respondents, each separately represented and with different views on the same issue, there may be deadlock.",5,65,014-001-095-007-018-065,504
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"What these rules provide for is the default appointment of arbitrators in such situations, which is eminently sensible. It requires parties to name arbitrators at specific points in the process as well. So, this also reduces the chance that the appointment of arbitrators will be used as a way to delay proceedings.",6,66,014-001-095-007-018-066,505
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Now, the core of arbitration is always party autonomy and party autonomy is still protected here because if parties have agreed on their own default mechanism where agreement cannot be reached, that should still prevail. What this amendment deals with such a situation where parties did not really provide the mechanism but would not have wanted deadlock either. So, what this provides is really a process by which this deadlock can be broken and the arbitration process can be moved smoothly along, even where parties or whether there are three or more parties who cannot agree on the arbitrator.",7,67,014-001-095-007-018-067,506
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),The second amendment also deals with another vexed issue and this is confidentiality,8,68,014-001-095-007-018-068,507
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Confidentiality obligations are common in arbitration proceedings. This is also one of the main attractions of arbitration for many parties as they would prefer to settle disputes out of the public eye. However, the protection of confidentiality is sometimes more difficult because the most common remedy for breach of confidentiality is to get an injunction to prevent dissemination of the information. This would only be available if the information is not already in the public domain. Thus, speed is of the essence if one wishes to get injunctive relief to protect confidentiality of matters subject to arbitration.",9,69,014-001-095-007-018-069,508
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"For most practitioners, we would agree that the Tribunal always have powers to make such orders but this was never expressly set out in the legislation. There was some debate on whether tribunals may have the power and to what extent that powers would extend to making confidentiality a part of the arbitration. So, by making this amendment to section 12 of the International Arbitration Act – which is really a section that spells out the Tribunal's powers – what it now provides specifically is that the Tribunal has such powers to make orders to protect confidentiality in an arbitration. Of course, the scope of this obligation is not defined precisely but this is necessary because exactly what documents are covered by it, which are already out in the public domain, which are not – these are all matters for that Tribunal to decide. But at least the one debate that will be off the table is whether or not the Tribunal has these powers.",10,70,014-001-095-007-018-070,509
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The other benefit of putting it in this section of the International Arbitration Act is that the Court will also now have the power to make an order where a Tribunal is not able to so this is also, I think, necessary as a catch all provision because given the speed with which one has to move if you want to protect confidentiality.

They are craving for certainty both in terms of costs and outcome of arbitration proceedings especially in the midst of this economic outlook. They require more flexibility; some may prefer greater court supervision on matters of law in arbitral proceedings. Others, as so, and prefer to waive appeals to the High Court on arbitral awards in the interests of having finality in the arbitral process. Corporations are also rethinking their agreements to prepare for a post-COVID world and considering the best dispute resolution mechanism that would offer them the best flexibility or option.",6,79,014-001-095-007-018-079,518

The second would allow parties who on the other hand prefer minimal curial intervention, to agree to waive or limit the annulment grounds under the relevant sections of the IAA and the Model Law.",9,82,014-001-095-007-018-082,521
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),I believe that these proposals would be beneficial to Singapore.,10,83,014-001-095-007-018-083,522
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Firstly, they would sharpen our edge as a preferred seat of arbitration as they would cement parties’ autonomy, front and centre, in our arbitration legislative framework. Parties would have more options and flexibility to tailor an international agreement to suit their unique purposes, especially in preparation for a post-COVID world. This would hopefully then attract more cross-border transactions and international disputes to be heard before the Singapore Courts and SIAC.",11,84,014-001-095-007-018-084,523
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"Consequently, it would only mean more exposure and training for our local lawyers from a professional development standpoint. As an international disputes lawyer, I have handled disputes in various jurisdictions and arbitration centres, SIAC here, London Court of International Arbitration and International Court of Arbitration in London and Paris. However, looking at the current climate, local younger lawyers, may not get much exposure and opportunity to experience handling international arbitration disputes. As such, we need to consider tabling these other proposals soon for the benefit of our future generations of talent.",12,85,014-001-095-007-018-085,524

2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang),"I therefore seek an indication from the Minister on whether the other proposals in the consultation paper, particularly the two I mentioned, are being tabled and if so, when. Clarifications notwithstanding, Mr Speaker, I support the amendments to the Bill.",15,88,014-001-095-007-018-088,527
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"  Sir, Singapore has emerged as one of the leading hubs for international arbitration in recent years.

2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"My first clarification is on the default mode of appointment of arbitrators in multi-party arbitration. It is good that we recognise that we need to provide for the appointment of arbitrators in multi-party disputes which are on the rise. They occur, for instance, in disputes involving joint ventures, mergers and oil and gas acquisition.",4,92,014-001-095-007-018-092,531

The authority can also reappoint or revoke any appointments made.",5,93,014-001-095-007-018-093,532
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),It is unclear why the failure of just one side to appoint an arbitrator means that the appointing authority must now step in to appoint all three arbitrators even if the other side managed to agree on their arbitrator.,6,94,014-001-095-007-018-094,533
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Essentially, this means that failure to agree by one side, makes the agreement reached by the other side ineffective.",7,95,014-001-095-007-018-095,534
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),I do understand that it is common for arbitration institutions to require the appointing authority to appoint all three arbitrators if either the claimants or the respondents are unable to come to an agreement on an arbitrator.,8,96,014-001-095-007-018-096,535
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"However, there is a permutation on this model under article 8(1) of the 2020 London Court of International Arbitration Rules.

2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My second clarification is on the amendment to expressly recognise the powers of the arbitral tribunal and the High Court to enforce obligations of confidentiality.,12,100,014-001-095-007-018-100,539
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),This amendment is welcome and will assist in tightening the process and preserving confidentiality of the proceedings.,13,101,014-001-095-007-018-101,540

In the feedback we that we received from the various consultations, the principle of equal treatment of the parties in the context especially of the appointment of the tribunal was something which was emphasised to us. It is part of the adjudicative system.",6,127,014-001-095-007-018-127,566

2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Although the solutions adopted differ in some particulars, most major institutional rules, including the LCIA Arbitration Rules that Mr Louis Ng referred to, now either permit or, in fact, require the institutions to designate the entire tribunal in multi-party proceedings. In other words, the moment there is a disagreement on one party's nomination, then the rules either permit or, in fact, they require the appointing authority to designate the entire tribunal. That is the position in LCIA and also some other major institutions. The reason behind this is to preclude imbalance or, at least, the perception of imbalance in the way in which the tribunal is subsequently appointed and avoid a situation where just one party has a say on his or her nominee for the arbitration.",8,129,014-001-095-007-018-129,568
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In scoping section 9B, we can see that there are many reasons why a party may not be able to agree or has chosen not to agree to the arbitrator. It could be because parties do not identify with the same “side” as the party nominating it even though we may be co-respondents to the arbitration, or it may be because one party is intentionally delaying the proceedings, not nominating, or dragging its feet, as I have mentioned earlier, so as to trigger the default mechanism to appoint all three and, in that process, hope to sideline the choice put up by the other party. And we are very much alive to that possibility.",9,130,014-001-095-007-018-130,569
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"So, to allow the appointing authority some flexibility and the discretion to take into account what I have just articulated and, indeed, what Mr Louis Ng had put forward in his speech, the appointing authority is now clothed with the ability to look at all relevant circumstances and we do not define upfront what that might be precisely because it may differ from case to case and the antecedent conduct of the parties in terms of the choice of the arbitrator would be something that the appointing authority would look at.",10,131,014-001-095-007-018-131,570
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"So, to that extent, the authority can look at factors, such as whether the parties on one side may have reached an agreement or not in the way that Mr Louis Ng has put it, or the reasons why one side was not able to come to an agreement. That is also relevant. It may not be because of trying to frustrate the process or trying to delay the proceedings. That is also relevant.

Mr Vikram Nair also noted that this gives a degree of flexibility because, as a case proceeds, the quality and nature of confidentiality over a specific piece of information or document might change. Likewise, whether or when a confidentiality obligation is to be waived must also be assessed in the context of the facts in which the issue arises.",16,137,014-001-095-007-018-137,576

2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Moving to Mr Louis Ng's question as to why the obligation of confidentiality is not codified and whether we would consider doing so, let me again give a bit of background.",24,145,014-001-095-007-018-145,584
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"As I have mentioned earlier, it has its roots in common law, so it is implied in the proceedings. Mr Louis Ng mentioned that, in Hong Kong, it has been codified and it might then improve or, at least, enhance the proceedings. Let me just clarify that the fact that there is a duty of confidentiality is really quite unarguable. So, what Hong Kong has done is to say that there is a duty of confidentiality. But in our proceedings here in Singapore, especially in the context of what I have mentioned in the SIAC Rules, it is really quite unarguable. What the real issue is, when it comes to confidentiality, is often what are the quality and nature of that confidentiality. What does it do to the information and documents that are exchanged in those proceedings? That, as I have mentioned earlier, might take a different shape or be differently contoured, depending on the context.",25,146,014-001-095-007-018-146,585
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"So, what exactly is that scope? To whom does it apply? Does it apply only to the parties or the witnesses? You may have to look at what are the facts of that case, bring them up and the context, before you assess that question. When does it apply? Does it apply at the start? But it may not have the same quality as the start if, subsequently, information is disclosed or allowed to be disclosed or divulged by one party. So, the further context as to when you are looking at the issue will also be relevant.",26,147,014-001-095-007-018-147,586
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Of course, finally, how is it best enforced? Is it by way of an injunction of some sort, a mandatory injunction, or would the parties be allowed to disclose it in a measured way under a ringfence or redacted.",27,148,014-001-095-007-018-148,587
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"So, these are all questions that I hope Mr Louis Ng will appreciate, but which arise maybe as a consequence of there being a confidentiality obligation in the first place which, as far as we are concerned, there is no argument over. Which is why we are proposing these amendments to allow the tribunal and the High Court to enforce these obligations.",28,149,014-001-095-007-018-149,588
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"But the question as to what you do with the confidential obligations, how you enforce, is something that ought to be looked at case to case and context to context. That is something that the High Court here in Singapore and also internationally have espoused. So, for that reason, we have decided against codifying and setting out the exact scope to what it applies and when it applies and let the Courts and the tribunal assess that question on a case-by-case basis.",29,150,014-001-095-007-018-150,589
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In addition, we have also taken this view because it is also a recognition that this area of law is still evolving. There have been cases, both locally as well as internationally. Some, Mr Patrick Tay has cited earlier, and also International case law on this and it is a question that is best left to the common law at this stage to develop more fully.",30,151,014-001-095-007-018-151,590
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"I would add to Mr Louis Ng's point also that where parties to an agreement – if you come to an agreement and you have a specific concern, you have a specific confidentiality attached to, say, an IP patent or to a piece of information that is very sensitive – it is open to the parties to expressly incorporate provisions specific to their own needs in their arbitration agreement and that will be enforced. Members will remember that, at the outset, I mentioned that the confidentiality arises in a number of ways, one of which is through the parties' express agreement in the arbitration agreement itself.",31,152,014-001-095-007-018-152,591
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,Mr Louis Ng will know that the Courts have consistently looked at the scope of the arbitration agreement and to study that to assess the extent of the confidentiality obligations.,32,153,014-001-095-007-018-153,592
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Next, let me move on to the amendments which have considered in the consultation but not brought in this Bill. Both Mr Louis Ng and Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim have enquired about these amendments and the proposals that were considered. I have briefly outlined these other considerations earlier and they broadly relate to the opt-in right of appeal and the proposal for the waiver or limitation of the annulment grounds.",33,154,014-001-095-007-018-154,593
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"These are still being studied and are not part of today's Bill, but I welcome Mr Vikram Nair's as well as Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim's views on them. I think Mr Louis Ng also said that these would add value to our landscape. We agree with the views that are set out. We will add them on to the very many REACH views that we have received so far on this and study them together with the various stakeholders that I have mentioned at the outset. When we are ready with that, we will come back and I am sure we will also consult with Mr Louis Ng and the others who have raised the points here.",34,155,014-001-095-007-018-155,594
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"In the final analysis, on these points, I want to assure Members and the arbitration community that my Ministry recognises the range of options and the diversity of views on these proposals. As I have said, some go towards whether or not they should be implemented; others have given us suggestions as to how they can be implemented. The operationalisation of these mechanisms also needs some study to ensure that they are consistent and that they lend themselves to fairness.",35,156,014-001-095-007-018-156,595
2020-10-05,International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-018,Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai,"Sir, in conclusion, we believe that this Bill introduces amendments that best serve the needs of the arbitral community. As I have flagged, this is a process that is on-going and we are always taking into account what users want to see – developments in the law and, of course, international conventions and practices as well. We will continue to make Singapore an attractive seat for arbitration disputes.",36,157,014-001-095-007-018-157,596

Public toilets in coffee shops and hawker centres are an area of concern and the cleanliness of bin centres and waste disposal areas need to be improved. One in five respondents to the SMU survey thought it acceptable to leave rubbish around if there was already litter in the area. One in three respondents believed that it is the cleaners' responsibility to return trays.

In general, premises, such as a pre-school or coffee shop, will require an ECC while more complex or multi-tenanted premises will require an ECO, with a higher level of competency to coordinate efforts amongst different tenants within the premises.

2020-10-05,Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-019,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"First, I propose we introduce a grading system for cleanliness at specified premises, starting with public toilets at coffee shops and hawker centres. A grading system will help increase hygiene standards in public toilet. These standards have fallen in recent years, according to an SMU survey aptly named ""Waterloo"". Over 25% of the 6,000 respondents said they would not use the toilets in coffee shops and hawker centres.",15,70,014-001-095-007-019-070,671

2020-10-05,Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-019,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My second proposal builds on our idea of a grading system. Will the Minister consider linking the grading system to the licensing duration and licensing fees of coffee shops and hawker centres?,22,77,014-001-095-007-019-077,678
2020-10-05,Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-019,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"For instance, we could offer a slightly longer licence term or lower licensing fees for coffee shops and hawker centres that attain and maintain a certain minimum cleanliness grade.

2020-10-05,Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-019,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),My last point is about labour conditions. Let us remember that higher hygiene standards also means more work for our cleaners.,29,84,014-001-095-007-019-084,685
2020-10-05,Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-019,Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon),"Many are already struggling. Mdm Low, a 67-year-old cleaner, told the media that she cleans the toilets four to five times during each of her 12-hour shift.

While COVID-19 has caused widespread economic hardships and taken a toll on many individuals, there are silver linings to this pandemic.

Dirty public toilets are a ubiquitous sight in Singapore and I am sure many of us have experienced this from time to time.

This set of specifications will also ensure that toilets that are being upgraded or built will be up to the ES standards. Examples of useful features include better drainage, better ventilation to minimise foul odours and speed up evaporation, hand-dryers that are right next to the sinks, and hands-free sensor taps and toilet flushes. With an ageing population, fall prevention should be a priority. Therefore, the floors of all public toilets should use non-slip materials or coatings.

2020-10-05,Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-019,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"First, the new environmental sanitation programmes cannot work without well-trained workers. They must also be paid fairly so that we can attract more workers to join the industry.  Businesses must adopt outcome-based procurement practices and Government give recognition to companies that work towards increased productivity with the adoption of technology. Businesses and Government agencies should award cleaning contracts to progressive employers who upskill and reward their workers. We should also be bold and look at ECO and ECC jobs as the pinnacle of the Progressive Wage Model or PWM for cleaners.",6,198,014-001-095-007-019-198,799
2020-10-05,Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-019,Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines),"Second, we must recognise that Singapore relies heavily on cleaning services to ensure the cleanliness of public areas. Despite Governmental and businesses' efforts in working towards a cleaner Singapore, we must remember that this responsibility lies in the individual too. Take the example of returning of trays in Food & Beverage establishments. In the third Public Cleanliness Satisfaction Survey undertaken by SMU, 36% of respondents said they were unsure whether trays should be returned. Public education is thus, vital, in working towards a cleaner Singapore and this initiative will instil greater individual responsibility to keep Singapore clean.",7,199,014-001-095-007-019-199,800

The contravention of the relevant sections in the amendments in section 62A(5), 62B(3), 62C(6), 63(2), 66A(7) by the Manager of any specific premises/owner/occupier would constitute an offence. Upon conviction, the offence attracts a fine not exceeding $5,000 on the first offence and a fine not exceeding $10,000 for the second or subsequent offences. This serves as an effective deterrent to the management of smaller premises, all those without as much resources. However, I am concerned that the deterrent effect of the fine may not be as effective for well-resourced entities. In the event of persistent contravention of the Act, will the Minister look into imposing non-monetary sanctions, including suspensions of operations to supplement the existing fine structure to send a stronger deterrent signal against non-compliance?",8,200,014-001-095-007-019-200,801

""Stay home because we can't"" – this was one of the viral phrases first expressed by essential workers. COVID-19 can be acquired through contact with surfaces contaminated with the virus and laboratory tests have demonstrated that the virus can survive on surfaces for two to three days. As such, ensuring environmental hygiene through regular cleaning and disinfection of places with high volume of people minimises the risk of transmission.

2020-10-05,Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-019,Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio),"Second, one of the biggest lessons we have learned from COVID-19 is the importance of prompt and timely action in our response to pandemics. While I also support the move to expand the powers of the Director-General to issue directives to any entity or persons to clean and/or disinfect the premises from the first warning signs of a potential health risk or disease outbreak, we are also aware that viruses do not only have an impact on health, but also on the economy. These expanded powers include the possibility of the Director-General giving a directive to close the relevant premises, or any part of the relevant premises, for a period not exceeding 14 days for the purpose of cleaning and disinfecting – such cleaning and disinfecting to take place in a manner and within the time specified in such directive. The discretion to make these directives will need to be weighed carefully and I know that premise managers will be wondering what sort of manner and time period is likely to be specified, as businesses need to plan for these possibilities and this will incur cost.",8,209,014-001-095-007-019-209,810

While reactive learning is, unfortunately, going to be necessary when dealing with a pandemic, we can take a proactive approach by working with the public to transform Singapore from a cleaned city, to a clean city. We must find more effective ways of working with the public to imbue a culture of personal responsibility in the cleanliness of the facilities that we share, as they do in countries, such as Japan, which has a national habit of Marie Kondo-ing and keeping things clean and tidy. I believe that we must double down our efforts in building a responsible culture to keep our public toilets clean, return our trays and utensils so that food scraps do not attract unwanted pests which carry diseases, and picking up after ourselves in shared spaces.",12,213,014-001-095-007-019-213,814

Today, the solution to limit the effects of second-hand smoke floating from a neighbour is for the non-smokers to shut their windows or doors. This cannot be a fair outcome. A practical way is to perhaps require resident smokers to close their windows and doors when they smoke and, of course, to go down to the open spaces at the ground floor if they have kids around. This solution aligns to existing NEA regulations which require windows of private vehicles to be fully wound up so that the second-hand tobacco smoke is expelled when the driver smokes in certain areas.",8,227,014-001-095-007-019-227,828

Importantly, this proposal is a balanced approach that draws a line and recognises the need for both sides and not just the party whose health is being endangered to play their part. It will also go a long way towards reducing the tension between neighbours as our living spaces become more compact. This will be yet another step taken in the right direction that does not add to the complexity of existing enforcement measures.

2020-10-05,Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-019,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"We must not further delay the important step in raising cleaning standards. According to a recent study by SMU, the cleanliness of our toilets has regressed compared to 2016. These invisible bacteria and viruses in the toilets are quite hardy unless they are being neutralised by disinfectants regularly. Frequent habits, such as using mobile phones while in the toilets, further exacerbate the transmission of diseases beyond the washroom. Hence, if the dirtiest places can be kept clean and generally germ-free, infectious disease transmission can be well-controlled at source.",3,254,014-001-095-007-019-254,855
2020-10-05,Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-019,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"I would like to touch on the importance of public education. It is common knowledge that when it is everybody's problem, then fewer people will act on it. Many public washrooms, especially in hawker centres and coffee shops, are not well kept. Unfortunately, there are many irresponsible culprits who reflect poor civic responsibility and leave the responsibility of cleaning up to the many senior uncles and aunties who have to clean for a living.

It was a little humbling at first but, after a while, we learnt to master the techniques of using different brushes and detergents for different locations. Till now, I continue using these skills I learnt in school and I will always keep my toilets at home sparkling clean.

For instance, free weights were found to contain 362 times more germs than toilet seats. Many of these sports venues, especially the gyms and studios, are enclosed within an air-conditioned environment, with no natural ventilation. The washrooms and shower facilities are also often packed, especially during the morning and evening peak periods. There are inconsistencies in the housekeeping hygiene standards as some gyms and studios ensure thorough cleaning and some do not. Young and old alike, everyone goes to the gym to keep fit and not to fall ill from a bacteria or viral infection.

2020-10-05,Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-019,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"However, we need to look into the hawker centres and coffee shops. We need to ensure that these premises meet the environmental sanitation standards. Most public toilets no longer collect a fee to use the toilets and the amendments to EPHA must not result in a regressive step where patrons are then required to pay a fee for the use of the washrooms. So, we need to look into the inevitable additional manpower and higher costs. These cost increases may be passed on to the tenants and, in turn, to the patrons in the form of higher food prices.",14,265,014-001-095-007-019-265,866
2020-10-05,Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-019,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"To nurture a proactive ""keep-clean culture"", I would also suggest MSE consider a carrot-and-stick approach rather than just a stick approach. We could incentivise premises owners to consistently maintain a high standard of cleanliness and hygiene, by providing a clean property tax rebate. Dedicated efforts and focus must be taken to consistently score well on every inspection. I think incentives will go a long way to motivate both the premises owners and the cleaning crew to do more than just the bare minimum.",15,266,014-001-095-007-019-266,867
2020-10-05,Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-019,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"Another suggestion is to promote active citizenry in reporting venues with poor sanitation standards directly via an app to NEA. The public can be the eyes and ears on the ground to help NEA inspectors focus on premises that require their attention. The premises owners must be taken to task. In addition, perhaps NEA could consider an annual contest for the public to vote in the top three venues with the cleanest toilets into the Hall of Fame, as well as the worst three venues with the dirtiest toilets into the Hall of Shame. No one wants to belong to the latter, so such a contest may put some social pressure to keep premises owners motivated and this could possibly be more effective than summons and fines by NEA.",16,267,014-001-095-007-019-267,868

2020-10-05,Environmental Public Health (Amendment) Bill,014-001-095-007-019,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"First, we suggest the implementation of a cleanliness grading system and also an incentive system which will link to the premises licence renewal or property tax rebate, so as to encourage proactive control of hygiene standards. Premise owners can also consider implementing operation processes or additional equipment that will raise efficiency of cleaning. For example, coffee shop owners can consider implementing a more effective pest control solution or automated vacuum and washing equipment.

2020-10-05,Protection Against Second-hand Smoke in our Homes,014-001-095-007-023,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Two, I expected that we would raise the issue of whether it is enforceable and I addressed that in the speech that it can be. Why can we not just use the cameras that we use for high-rise littering there is pointing at the facade of the building that can capture someone who is throwing a cigarette butt out of their window. Why can we not use the same camera to capture someone smoking at their windows or the balconies and not point it inside to the house. So, if they are lying down on their bed and smoking, that is okay. I am just saying move them away from the windows and balconies so that it minimises, not completely eradicate, but minimises the effects of second-hand smoke on the neighbours.",4,69,014-001-095-007-023-069,1017
2020-10-05,Protection Against Second-hand Smoke in our Homes,014-001-095-007-023,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"  To the Member's first question, we are dealing with this issue of second-hand smoke not just as a neighbourly dispute. The fact that we started legislation to ban smoking in common areas, really, one of the priority is because we want to protect the public from second-hand smoke. That is why there are 32,000 places now that are smoking prohibited areas. So, in fact, the smokers have very little areas, very little space for them to smoke. They cannot smoke in playgrounds, common corridors, staircases and so on.",1,70,014-001-095-007-023-070,1018
2020-10-05,Protection Against Second-hand Smoke in our Homes,014-001-095-007-023,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"The reason really is protecting public from second-hand smoke as well as of course making it very difficult for smokers to smoke because we hope that that will help to reduce their smoking prevalence rate. And indeed, we have been successful in doing this because I have actually given statistics to show that smoking prevalence rates have fallen to 10.6% in 2019, and we are doing more. We are going to expand the smoking prohibited areas to even more places.",2,71,014-001-095-007-023-071,1019

So, it is not really just about neighbourly disputes. But, as I have said to ban smoking in homes, there are couple of issues, not just about enforcement but also about privacy concerns. So, that leads to my answer to the second question. Why can we not just use the cameras we are using? Indeed, in my response, I have elaborated on why it is difficult to enforce using the cameras we have – both optical cameras as well as thermal cameras.",3,72,014-001-095-007-023-072,1020
2020-10-05,Protection Against Second-hand Smoke in our Homes,014-001-095-007-023,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"So, just give Members an illustration. In fact, as the Member said, we have had years of experience using optical cameras for high-rise littering enforcement and then recently thermal cameras for enforcement against smoking in prohibited areas. So, because we have years of experience, my NEA colleagues fully understand the intractable difficulties in enforcing against smoking at balconies and windows.",4,73,014-001-095-007-023-073,1021

First of all, thermal cameras are of shorter range than the optical cameras for high-rise littering. And as I have said, for high-rise littering, we can have the optical cameras at ground level point as Member said, at the facade, as long as you can see somebody throwing the cigarette – the act of throwing – we will then investigate from which floor, we know which unit, we can investigate and then get the person to admit to the littering offence.",5,74,014-001-095-007-023-074,1022
2020-10-05,Protection Against Second-hand Smoke in our Homes,014-001-095-007-023,Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan,"For smoking at balconies and windows, as I have explained, it is not so easy because you need to see the smoker in the act of taking the lighted cigarette or holding the cigarette and to do that you have to train the camera at level with as well as directly at the windows or balconies. First, because of the design of flats and increasingly so, it is very difficult to find common areas where you can put cameras and be able to aim directly at that flat. Flats, for instance, with recess windows and balconies, you cannot do it. Most of the private condominium designs are very difficult, you cannot do it. Even for high-rise littering, it is already difficult and that is just the facade. For smoking, you actually have to look in. And the problem is, if you just step back behind, like I say, curtains, walls and so on, the person is actually still near the windows and balconies, but you cannot catch. So, that is optical camera.",6,75,014-001-095-007-023-075,1023

For example, Muslim F&B businesses which opt to only use Islamic paraphernalia or Muslim-ownership labels to indicate they are a halal-food establishment should take care to ensure that their food is halal. The MUIS halal logo also must not be used or modified by businesses that have not attained official certification, so that it does not lead to a dilution of the mark.

Without this crucial deterrence, Singapore's national defences can easily be compromised and with potentially catastrophic consequences. Our own history demonstrates and reminds us of this existential vulnerability. Within hours after Japanese forces invaded Peninsula Malaysia in 1941, General Yamashita sent an air raid over Singapore – 17 planes were involved. With air superiority established, Japanese forces advanced swiftly down and reached Singapore within days. The British forces had to retreat into Singapore and blew up the causeway to slow down the Japanese assault. But without an airforce then to protect our skies, residents on our island were still at the mercy of bombs that fell from Japanese fighter planes. The death and destruction that ensued was horrendous. As one survivor, Mr Conceicao, who was 17 years old at that time, vividly recalled ""we saw hands, heads maybe, legs and parts of the human body lying about…this affected us throughout the course of the war and our life"".",1,2,014-001-095-007-030-002,1058

It’s a virtuous state of affairs, but one that can slip if ever the capabilities of our pilots and planes degrade. And to keep up their skills, RSAF pilots need to train adequately. We recognize the inconvenience and disruption to residents here. MINDEF/SAF has done as much as we can to keep the RSAF training tempo locally to essential levels and activity.

I thanked the mayor for their support and understanding for our fighter detachment’s training there, especially to tolerate the noise, just as our resident here do. He smiled, and replied, ""it’s the sound of freedom."" Singapore is thankful that we have our good friends and partners in many countries who support our defence efforts.",3,4,014-001-095-007-030-004,1060

During actual flying, the RSAF has introduced measures to reduce the noise. First, most of the local flying is conducted over waters rather than land, and avoiding residential areas except during take off, landing and transit to and from training areas. To illustrate, the northern end of the runway at Paya Lebar Air Base is approximately six kilometres from our territorial boundary. The fighter pilots have mere seconds after take-off to bank a sharp left in order to keep within our territorial airspace.",4,5,014-001-095-007-030-005,1061

This is higher than the minimum speed available on the market, and is sufficient to support common daily activities such as internet surfing, video calls, and video streaming.

2020-10-05,Percentage of Singapore's Recyclable Waste Exported,014-001-095-007-039,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Recyclables have an intrinsic value. The value is a function of the value of the recycled material, the market price of its substitute, and the cost of recycling, including transportation to an export destination. If there is no export market for it, or if the cost of recycling outweighs the value of the recycled product, the waste collector may choose not to collect the recyclables but to treat them as general waste and send them to the incineration plant. Therefore, my Ministry recognises the need to build up our local recycling capabilities. For example, we are working with the private sector to develop mechanical recycling solutions to turn waste plastics into plastic pellets for manufacturing new products. And chemical recycling to process contaminated plastics that cannot be mechanically recycled. For e-waste, we are developing capabilities to recycle Large Household Appliances, ICT products, batteries and lamps to support the upcoming e-waste Extended Producer Responsibility framework.

Over the next three years, we expect three new e-waste recycling facilities to be set up that will allow us to recycle more than 64,000 tonnes of e-waste per year. At the same time, we are working with research institutes and companies to develop solutions in treating and recycling e-waste in a more energy-efficient and eco-friendly manner. For example, the NTU Singapore-CEA1 Alliance for Research in Circular Economy (SCARCE) is developing innovative solutions to treat and recover resources from e-waste like lithium ion batteries and silicon solar panels, and finding ways to detoxify and recycle plastic parts in e-waste.",2,3,014-001-095-007-040-003,1124

The vaccine is not suitable for those who have not been previously infected. The World Health Organization recommends that countries considering vaccination as part of a dengue control programme undertake pre-vaccination screening, to avoid vaccinating those who are unsuited. If screening is not feasible, vaccination can be considered in areas with a prevalence of at least 80% by nine years of age.",1,2,014-001-095-007-041-002,1128

Among adults age 18 to 74 years, the prevalence is 45%, still below the threshold for population vaccination without screening. In view of this, the Ministry of Health's Expert Committee on Immunisation (ECI) has advised that Dengvaxia is not an effective means to control dengue at the population level. Individuals who wish to be vaccinated should first consult their doctor on whether Dengvaxia is appropriate for them. As such, it has not been included in the national immunisation schedules and is not eligible for government subsidy.",2,3,014-001-095-007-041-003,1129

The Government maintains an arm’s-length relationship with these investment entities, and neither directs nor influences their commercial or operational decisions.

There are three key prongs to our approach. First, we work with our tripartite partners to stave off job losses. The Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment (Tripartite Advisory) emphasises retrenchment as a last resort, only after employers have exhausted other alternatives such as redeployment and flexible work arrangements. The Government also intervened aggressively upstream to protect jobs when COVID-19 happened, by introducing the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) to support companies in their wage costs. Since the launch of JSS, over $16 billion of payouts have been disbursed, benefitting over two million local workers.",3,4,014-001-095-007-051-004,1180

Even with our best efforts, retrenchments may be inevitable in some companies. Hence, the second prong of our approach is to work closely with our tripartite partners to ensure that retrenchments are conducted responsibly. The Ministry of Manpower has advised employers to adhere to the Tripartite Advisory, and use clear and objective criteria in the selection of employees and conduct the retrenchment responsibly and sensitively.",4,5,014-001-095-007-051-005,1181

Museums and galleries are now also open to visitors. We have taken a cautious approach towards the resumption of activities in the arts and culture sector, particularly on live performances which carry higher transmission risks. Around the world, we have observed COVID-19 clusters forming as a result of such performances.

Government agencies responsible for the various economic sector are working closely with their industry partners to review their plans, including for major infrastructure projects.  While some infrastructure projects such as the construction of Changi Airport Terminal 5 have been delayed as a result of COVID-19, the Government remains committed to infrastructure projects that are critical investments for future generations.",1,2,014-001-095-007-057-002,1209
2020-10-05,Smart Sensors for Lightings at Common Areas and Parks,014-001-095-007-058,Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan,"asked the Minister for National Development whether smart light sensors can be installed in all our common areas, parks and the environment to turn on lights automatically instead of having to manually adjust the timings during certain periods or months when the environment turns dark early.",1,1,014-001-095-007-058-001,1210
2020-10-05,Smart Sensors for Lightings at Common Areas and Parks,014-001-095-007-058,Mr Desmond Lee,"  HDB has implemented the Smart Lighting System (SLS) in all public housing developments with tenders called since May 2018.  The SLS incorporates light sensors to sense ambient lighting levels and automatically turn the lights on when ambient lighting is low, for instance during rainy conditions.  The SLS covers both the indoor and outdoor common areas of the development, including void decks, corridors, and driveways.",1,2,014-001-095-007-058-002,1211
2020-10-05,Smart Sensors for Lightings at Common Areas and Parks,014-001-095-007-058,Mr Desmond Lee,"Prior to the implementation of the SLS, light sensors would be installed in specific areas that required additional lighting to supplement the lack of natural lighting during bad weather conditions.  However, the area of coverage could not be easily adjusted as this would require re-wiring and the installation of additional sensors.  In contrast, with the SLS, light sensors are integrated with the lighting network, offering the flexibility to easily adjust or even extend the area of coverage to the whole development should the need arise.  HDB is currently working with the Town Councils to extend the SLS to all existing estates under the HDB Green Towns Programme.",2,3,014-001-095-007-058-003,1212

2020-10-05,Flexibility for MediSave Claims for Age-related Medical Treatment,014-001-095-007-059,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"  Through Government subsidies, MediShield Life, MediSave and MediFund, we ensure that healthcare services remain affordable to Singaporeans. MediSave withdrawal limits are sized to adequately cover the co-payment for the majority of patients in subsidised settings.",1,2,014-001-095-007-059-002,1216
2020-10-05,Flexibility for MediSave Claims for Age-related Medical Treatment,014-001-095-007-059,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"In recent years, we have enhanced the MediSave withdrawal limits to provide greater flexibility for our seniors in managing age-related medical treatment. We announced earlier this year that the annual limit for patients with complex chronic conditions in the outpatient setting will be raised from $500 to $700 from 1 January 2021. This will help them better meet their needs, as the prevalence and severity of chronic diseases typically increases with age. To better support seniors’ long-term care needs, we have just launched the MediSave Care scheme on 1 October 2020, which allows cash withdrawals of up to $200 per month for severely disabled patients aged 30 and above. We have lowered the age threshold for Flexi-MediSave from 65 to 60, allowing younger and more seniors to benefit from this scheme for their treatments and screenings at polyclinics, Specialist Outpatient Clinics, and GP clinics on the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS). We will continue to review the MediSave withdrawal limits regularly, to strike a balance between helping Singaporeans pay for their healthcare services and retaining sufficient savings for their longer-term needs.",2,3,014-001-095-007-059-003,1217

For those who are unable to tap on these schemes, the Ministry of Health will consider appeals to use MediSave beyond the prevailing withdrawal limits on a case-by-case basis. No Singaporean will be denied necessary treatment due to an inability to pay.",3,4,014-001-095-007-059-004,1218
2020-10-05,Trends of Healthcare Charges Due to Greater Access to Insurance that Reduces Individual Cost-sharing Burden,014-001-095-007-060,Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim,"asked the Minister for Health (a) whether there has been any study of the differences, over time, between charges by private versus public healthcare providers; (b) whether this has been appreciably altered by the citizen/PR subsidy; and (c) whether the trend of rising costs has accelerated due to greater access to insurance products that reduce the individual cost-sharing burden.",1,1,014-001-095-007-060-001,1219
2020-10-05,Trends of Healthcare Charges Due to Greater Access to Insurance that Reduces Individual Cost-sharing Burden,014-001-095-007-060,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"  Between 2017 and 2019, average inpatient bill sizes in private healthcare settings grew by around 7% on a compounded annual growth rate basis. This was about twice the growth rate of 3.4% for average inpatient bills of unsubsidised patients in ""A"" wards in public healthcare institutions (PHI). Over the same period, average day surgery bills in the private setting grew by 4.3%, compared to 0.6% for unsubsidised PHI patients. As Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents can enjoy government subsidies of up to 80% by opting for affordable care in the PHI setting, it would not be meaningful to compare their charges with those in the private healthcare setting.",1,2,014-001-095-007-060-002,1220
2020-10-05,Trends of Healthcare Charges Due to Greater Access to Insurance that Reduces Individual Cost-sharing Burden,014-001-095-007-060,Mr Gan Kim Yong,"Some insurance products, such as Integrated Plan (IP) riders with full coverage, which cover the entire co-payment under the IP plan, have contributed to the higher growth rate for private sector bills. While such products are popular because no co-payment is required, the absence of co-payment can inadvertently lead to over-utilisation and rising healthcare costs, and ultimately, higher insurance premiums for all. This is why the Ministry had worked with insurers to introduce a minimum level of co-payment for new IP riders in 2018. This was an important move to preserve the principle of co-payment in our healthcare financing system. This measure will take time to bear fruit. All stakeholders, including patients and medical practitioners, must continue to exercise responsibility when choosing and recommending appropriate and necessary care.",2,3,014-001-095-007-060-003,1221

Follow-up surveys are conducted with trainees six months after completion of the course to ascertain post-training outcomes, such as the ability to apply the skills learnt at work. 86% of the trainees surveyed in 2019 indicated that they were able to perform better at work after undergoing SSG-funded training. The survey results are taken into consideration by SSG during the funding renewal process.

This is why SSG conducts regular surveys with employers to gauge the effectiveness of SkillsFuture training programmes. These include the Public Perception Survey on SkillsFuture, which surveys employers on the impact of SkillsFuture training on the work performance of their employees.

Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) are filed by financial institutions if they have reason to suspect that a financial transaction could be related to a crime.

However, we do not take this lightly. To prevent such fraudulent activities and restore confidence, there needs to be a strengthening of standards and practices of transparency and governance in the commodities trading sector, more robust credit risk assessment, as well as a move away from paper-based processes as they are more susceptible to risk of fraud.

This increase is likely due to more residents working from home during the Circuit Breaker in April and May, a situation which has continued even post-Circuit Breaker.

Generally, smokers appreciate the rationale behind the smoking prohibition and most comply willingly after being advised by NEA, Town Councils and HDB. Sometimes, smokers forget and light up where they should not, and friendly reminders from family and friends are helpful to signal the positive social norms that smokers should abide by. Visual reminders put up by Advisers and community leaders, such as posters in lifts and HDB areas where there have been feedback on unlawful smoking, are also useful in reminding smokers to be considerate and entrenching positive social norms.",2,3,014-001-095-007-087-003,1359

Without this crucial deterrence, Singapore's national defences can easily be compromised and with potentially catastrophic consequences. Our own history demonstrates and reminds us of this existential vulnerability. Within hours after Japanese forces invaded Peninsula Malaysia in 1941, General Yamashita sent an air raid over Singapore – 17 planes were involved. With air superiority established, Japanese forces advanced swiftly down and reached Singapore within days. The British forces had to retreat into Singapore and blew up the causeway to slow down the Japanese assault. But without an airforce then to protect our skies, residents on our island were still at the mercy of bombs that fell from Japanese fighter planes. The death and destruction that ensued was horrendous. As one survivor, Mr Conceicao, who was 17 years old at that time, vividly recalled ""we saw hands, heads maybe, legs and parts of the human body lying about… this affected us throughout the course of the war and our life"".",1,2,014-001-095-007-093-002,1390

First, the seriousness of the offence, in terms of the harm that the offence will cause to the victim and to society. Second, how frequent or widespread the offence is. Third, the need for deterrence. These considerations are considered in totality. For example, the fact that an offence is not widespread now, may not, by itself, be a decisive factor.",1,2,014-001-095-007-095-002,1405

While the capital sentence thresholds for drug trafficking may not seem high to the layperson, they actually involve significant quantities of drugs. For example, the capital sentence threshold amount of 15g of pure heroin (diamorphine) is equivalent to 1,250 straws of heroin, and feeds 180 drug abusers for a week.

MHA found that there was a 66% reduction in the average net weight trafficked for opium, in the four-year window after the mandatory death penalty was introduced in 1990 for trafficking more than 1,200g of opium. Similarly, in the four-year period after the introduction of the mandatory death penalty for trafficking involving more than 500g of cannabis in 1990, there was a 15 to 19 percentage point reduction in the probability that traffickers would choose to traffic above the capital sentence threshold.",7,8,014-001-095-007-095-008,1411

However, while the breast cancer screening rate is around 50% for women with tertiary level of education, it is 28% for women with primary level of education. The rate of late stage breast cancer diagnosis at Stages III and IV amongst Singapore women has remained relatively consistent at 28.6% between the five-year interval of 2009 to 2013 and 26.9% between 2014 to 2018.",1,2,014-001-095-007-109-002,1493

Any further deployment should complement the existing network of 26 public libraries across Singapore, which makes public libraries accessible for most Singaporeans. NLB also runs outreach programmes to bring library books to under-reached and under-privileged groups.

2020-10-05,Harnessing Advantages of Biodegradable Plastics to Reduce Reliance on Singapore's Landfill,014-001-095-007-114,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"  Plastic waste generated in Singapore is either recycled or incinerated. Unlike in many other countries, plastic waste is not landfilled directly. As such, the environmental benefits of using biodegradable plastics do not apply in Singapore’s context. Biodegradable as well as oxo-degradable plastics could even interfere with the recycling process when mixed with conventional plastics.",1,2,014-001-095-007-114-002,1509

2020-10-05,Measures in Place to Address Rat Sightings since Circuit Breaker Period,014-001-095-007-115,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"To keep the incidence of rat infestation low, NEA carries out islandwide surveillance to identify places which can attract rats, such as bin chutes where food waste is not well-managed. The surveillance information is shared with relevant government agencies and Town Councils (TCs) so that they can take preventive measures, such as improving housekeeping and conducting rat proofing works. NEA incentivises TCs with funding under the Rat Attack Programme to implement customised rat control measures in public housing estates. NEA also conducts regular inspections to ensure that agencies, TCs and premises owners implement adequate rat control measures and proper waste management practices, and will take enforcement action against them for any rat infestation.",2,3,014-001-095-007-115-003,1515

Operators must have a pest control contract to ensure that their premises are free of pest infestation. It is also their responsibility to keep their premises clean and well-maintained; and failure to do so constitutes an offence. Repeated offences or serious offences can result in suspension or even cancellation of the food establishment's licence. SFA conducts regular inspections at food establishments to ensure that they comply with food hygiene and safety, including keeping their premises free from rat infestation. These inspections continued during the circular breaker period. From January to August 2020, more than 40,000 inspections were conducted on food establishments.",3,4,014-001-095-007-115-004,1516

2020-10-05,Engaging with Supermarkets and Consumers to Reduce Plastic Pre-packaging of Fruits and Vegetables,014-001-095-007-116,Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien,"Next year, we will implement the mandatory packaging reporting framework, where producers of packaged products as well as retailers such as supermarkets with an annual turnover of more than $10 million will have to submit packaging data and plans to reduce, reuse or recycle packaging. This will make companies more aware of their packaging use (including plastic pre-packaging of fruits and vegetables) and encourage them to minimise waste and reduce business costs. The reporting framework will lay the foundation for an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework to manage packaging waste including plastics, which will be put in place no later than 2025. The EPR ensures that producers are responsible for the collection and end-of-life management of the packaging materials for their products, and encourages producers to reduce the amount of packaging used.",2,3,014-001-095-007-116-003,1520

Wet markets in their current form have gradually become less popular. Thus, when these older markets underwent the Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme from 2001 to 2013, market stalls vacated by stallholders retiring from the trade were removed to free up space for wider passageways and bigger areas for the remaining stalls. Similarly, when the Government announced in 2011 that it would restart the building of hawker centres, efforts were focused on increasing the number of cooked food stalls in new estates or existing estates with insufficient affordable eating options.",2,3,014-001-095-007-118-003,1531

This is to ensure the viability of the market stalls. From our experience, new markets, such as the one at Jurong West Hawker Centre, have generally not fared well. The concept of future markets would need to evolve to meet the emerging needs and preferences of consumers who have the options to buy online and from full-day, even 24-hour, supermarkets.

With the consent of the FDW, an employer can deploy the FDW to perform household duties at a relative's house to look after the employer’s child or aged parent under the supervision of the relative. In such situations, the employer is required to inform the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) of any such arrangements made, and must ensure that the FDW does not perform the full load of housework in both households.",1,2,014-001-095-007-139-002,1630

The rules concerning how FDWs can be deployed are published in the FDW's Guidebook (which is given out to all first-time FDWs) and in the FDW Employer's Guide (which employers can download from MOM's website). During the FDW Settling-in Programme (SIP), first-time FDWs are also informed of the scenarios and circumstances under which they are allowed to work outside of their employer’s household. Likewise, first-time employers are briefed through the Employers' Orientation Programme (EOP). The SIP and EOP also provide specific examples on arrangements that are disallowed. For example, an FDW is not allowed to work for a neighbour after completing chores for an employer, and an employer is not allowed to ask an FDW to engage in cleaning activities in their offices or shop spaces.",2,3,014-001-095-007-139-003,1631

Those who are assisting in MOM investigations will not be repatriated. The Ministry will assist affected FDWs to look for temporary employment or transfer to another employer during and after the investigation is completed.

2020-10-05,Residential Addresses Falsely Declared as Housing Addresses for Foreign Workers in Past Five Years,014-001-095-007-141,Mrs Josephine Teo,"  MOM takes a multi-pronged approach to ensure accurate addresses are declared for foreign workers. First, we hold employers responsible for reporting accurate residential addresses of their foreign workers. They are required to do so in the Online Foreign Worker Address Service. Employers remain responsible even when their workers source for their own accommodation. The online service ensures the occupancy limit of the address is not exceeded, and it also checks against tenancy registration records from the Housing and Development Board to ensure that the foreign worker is registered as a tenant by the homeowner.",1,2,014-001-095-007-141-002,1639

Homeowners can use the system to check the details of foreign workers registered at their address, and report to MOM if there are discrepancies. A significant increase in the number of false declaration cases were detected this way, explaining the increase in number of cases in 2019 from the previous year.
