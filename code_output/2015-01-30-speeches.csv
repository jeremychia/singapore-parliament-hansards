2015-01-30,Compulsory Fire Insurance for Residential and Commercial Properties,012-002-093-004-001,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Nevertheless, HDB home owners who take up HDB loans are required to purchase fire insurance from the HDB-appointed insurer. In addition, under the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act, Management Corporations are required to obtain insurance for strata-titled developments, so that they are able to undertake restoration work to the developments in the event of accidents such as a fire.",2,3,012-002-093-004-001-003,3
2015-01-30,Compulsory Fire Insurance for Residential and Commercial Properties,012-002-093-004-001,The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee),"Regardless, I encourage all owners to ensure that their properties are adequately insured against damages caused by unfortunate accidents such as a fire. It would be prudent to do so.",3,4,012-002-093-004-001-004,4

2015-01-30,Compulsory Fire Insurance for Residential and Commercial Properties,012-002-093-004-001,Mr Desmond Lee,"  Mdm Speaker, in response to the Member's questions, more than 80% of HDB flats are covered by basic fire insurance that is offered by HDB's appointed insurer. We do not track the number of HDB flats covered by fire insurance that is offered by other insurers. So, the actual percentage would probably be much more than that.",1,6,012-002-093-004-001-006,6
2015-01-30,Compulsory Fire Insurance for Residential and Commercial Properties,012-002-093-004-001,Mr Desmond Lee,"Of those who have taken up HDB's basic fire insurance, certainly, more than half do so voluntarily and not because they are currently still servicing HDB loans. This is because HDB writes to homeowners and encourages them to apply for or renew their HDB basic fire insurance cover. But for those who are still on HDB loans, HDB will remind them when their policy is near expiry, and if they for some reason forget or omit to do so, HDB will procure the insurance for them first, and then recover the premiums later.",2,7,012-002-093-004-001-007,7
2015-01-30,Compulsory Fire Insurance for Residential and Commercial Properties,012-002-093-004-001,Mr Desmond Lee,"Premiums for HDB's basic fire insurance policy are very affordable. For instance, if you are an owner of a 4-room flat, coverage for five years would cost you $5.40 for five years; for a 5-room flat, $6.60 for five years.",3,8,012-002-093-004-001-008,8
2015-01-30,Compulsory Fire Insurance for Residential and Commercial Properties,012-002-093-004-001,Mr Desmond Lee,"This basic fire insurance cost covers the basic building structure of the flat, the fixtures and the fittings provided by HDB, to keep these premiums low and affordable for all homeowners of HDB flats. If they wish to get additional coverage of costs, they may need to get further insurance for their personal properties as well as their renovations. I hope that adequately answers the Member's questions.",4,9,012-002-093-004-001-009,9

2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"  Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, ""That the Bill be now read a Second time.""",1,1,012-002-093-004-002-001,12
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Madam, in September 2012, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) embarked on a review of our liquor control measures. The review was prompted by several factors. The Ministry had received considerable public feedback on law and order concerns and disamenities arising from liquor consumption and drunkenness in public places. These concerns were echoed in media reports, with businesses and members of the public voicing concerns about youths congregating and getting inebriated in public areas, creating noise and causing other disturbances.",2,2,012-002-093-004-002-002,13
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Several Members of this House had also raised similar concerns on behalf of their constituents. Residents in the heartlands were worried about people gathering and consuming liquor along pavements, at HDB void decks, parks, playgrounds and other community places and spaces. These individuals would often disrupt the peace and leave a trail of broken bottles and other litter. Sometimes, the drinking led to fights and disorderly conduct, compounding the sense of insecurity. These problems were exacerbated by the easy availability of take-away liquor from nearby retail shops.",3,3,012-002-093-004-002-003,14
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Separately, the Police have also been monitoring incidents associated with the consumption of liquor. Last year, there were 47 cases of rioting linked to the consumption of liquor. ""Rioting"" is defined here in the law as groups of five or more persons engaging in fights and inflicting violence on others. In addition, there were about 100 cases of affray, meaning fewer than five, but also involved in such public fights, and there is a link to alcohol consumption. And there were 115 cases of serious hurt, which were also related to the consumption of liquor. These serious hurt cases include stabbing, cutting using dangerous weapons, and inflicting severe bodily pain on victims. In other words, if I can put it a different way, on average, there was one rioting incident and two cases of serious hurt each week that was related to alcohol consumption. And the trend has been on the rise. The incidents occurred across the island, with nine out of 10 occurring after 10.30 pm.",4,4,012-002-093-004-002-004,15
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Lest there be any misconception â€“ this is not attributable to any one nationality. And, indeed, I would say that the statistics speak for themselves. Generally, foreigners are not disproportionately represented in these statistics. Singaporeans and locals are also implicated in many of these incidents.",5,5,012-002-093-004-002-005,16
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Also, over the last three years, there was an average of 530 cases of persons found to be drunk and incapable in public places. And these numbers do not take into account the many cases of noise and other disturbances arising from liquor consumption, which are often unreported. Neither do they capture fully the inconveniences and sense of insecurity that affected residents had had to live with.",6,6,012-002-093-004-002-006,17
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Hence, there were widespread calls and compelling needs on the ground for the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to consider proactive measures to restrict the supply and consumption of liquor in public places, in order to avert these significant disamenities caused to residents, and mitigate the risks to law and order.",7,7,012-002-093-004-002-007,18
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"As part of the review, MHA conducted extensive public consultations, specifically between October 2013 and August 2014, and received about 400 pieces of written feedback from individuals and various organisations. The Ministry also engaged about 180 stakeholder groups including members of public, grassroots representatives and industry groups. In general, they were unequivocal in their support for the introduction of measures to curb retail sale of liquor, and its consumption in public places to keep their neighbourhoods safe and minimise the occurrence of fights, rowdiness, and other disamenities.",8,8,012-002-093-004-002-008,19
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"The Little India riot occurred in December 2013, in the midst of this process. The Committee of Inquiry into the riot later concluded that liquor was ""a major contributory factor to the nature and escalation of the riot."" Shortly after the incident, MHA implemented measures approved by this House, under the Public Order (Additional Temporary Measures) Act, to restrict the supply of take-away liquor and its consumption in public places within the designated special zone in Little India. Notwithstanding some of the initial concerns that were expressed, the implementation has been without incident. Residents and stakeholders in Little India have generally welcomed the positive impact of these measures including a heightened sense of safety and orderliness, and a significant reduction in disamenities.",9,9,012-002-093-004-002-009,20
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"MHA has also studied the practices in major cities in the United States, Australia and Europe. It is noteworthy that we have a rather liberal regime compared to major prominent cities around the world. Their liquor regulatory regimes vary, from those that impose a complete ban on the consumption of liquor in public areas, such as New York, Washington D.C, Gold Coast and Perth, to those that have strict controls in certain areas such as in Sydney, Austin and Paris. Our purpose in these studies was to understand how such curbs were implemented in such cities without diminishing their vibrancy or imposing undue constraints on their citizens.",10,10,012-002-093-004-002-010,21
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Madam, this Bill is the culmination of a deliberate two-year process that has been informed by the Police's operational assessment of the ground; widespread feedback and consultation; the experience of other jurisdictions, and, indeed, our own experience implementing similar measures in Little India. Its provisions address the demand and supply aspects in order to foster greater responsibility in the sale and consumption of alcohol. We sought a set of measures that is clear and consistent, easy to understand and comply with, and causes minimal disruption to the usual legitimate activities of residents. Any curbs on the retail sales of liquor also had to take into account the impact on businesses.",11,11,012-002-093-004-002-011,22
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"The Bill also provides for a range of enforcement powers that enables the Police to take more calibrated action in circumstances that might pose a risk to public order. This measured and holistic approach is necessary and entails important trade-offs, because what this Bill proposes, in effect, is a transition from the current regime which has very few restrictions, to one which has carefully calibrated restrictions that allow most alcohol-related activities to carry on as usual, but places restrictions at those times when they are most likely to cause disamenities to others, and in areas where there are law and order concerns. This proposed regime will set new norms of individual behaviour with respect to the purchase of take-away liquor and consumption of liquor in public places, in order to reduce the disamenities and risks to public order inflicted on the wider community.",12,12,012-002-093-004-002-012,23
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Madam, the Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill will provide the legislative framework to regulate the supply and consumption of liquor in public places. It will also provide for enforcement powers to mitigate the risks of public disorder and disamenities arising from public drunkenness. It consolidates and enhances existing provisions in various pieces of legislation, and introduces new provisions.",13,13,012-002-093-004-002-013,24
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Madam, let me now highlight key clauses in the Bill.",14,14,012-002-093-004-002-014,25
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"One component of the Bill relates to provisions on the public consumption of liquor and public drunkenness. Under Clause 12, the Minister can prescribe ""no-public drinking periods"" during which the consumption of liquor in public places is not permitted. As announced earlier, MHA intends to disallow the consumption of liquor in public places from 10.30 pm to 7.00 am daily, with stricter hours in specified zones, specifically in Geylang and Little India. Exemptions from this restriction will be provided under clauses 12 and 13.",15,15,012-002-093-004-002-015,26
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Madam, some have suggested that rather than a general restriction, we should impose restrictions on specific problem areas. We did consider this approach but it poses several problems. First, liquor-related law and order issues and disamenities are not confined only to certain ""hot spots""; in fact, they occur in different parts of the island. Second, dividing up a typical area which has residential units, some common areas such as void decks, playgrounds and neighbourhood parks, and some F&B and commercial outlets, into multiple finely delineated liquor control zones would lead to confusion and make compliance and enforcement more difficult. Third, the designation of special zones is likely to displace activity to neighbouring areas. Indeed, the Police have observed some evidence of this in areas adjacent to Little India. Potential trouble-makers could also play cat-and-mouse with enforcement officers by simply taking a step across the boundary.",16,16,012-002-093-004-002-016,27
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Also, the proposed restriction period of 10.30 pm to 7.00 am is intended to minimise the disruption to the usual activities of most residents. Individuals can continue to consume liquor in public places before 10.30 pm, except in the two specified zones. 10.30 pm is the closing time of most businesses in residential areas, and indeed, many close earlier. And it is also when most social and community activities such as local celebrations, getai and grassroots events end.",17,17,012-002-093-004-002-017,28
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Individuals can continue to consume liquor at licensed premises such as coffee shops, beer gardens, restaurants and bars, during their licensed hours, even if this is beyond 10.30 pm. So, there is no change.",18,18,012-002-093-004-002-018,29
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Members of the public attending an event in public places can also continue to consume liquor beyond 10.30 pm, if the organiser has obtained the requisite permit from Police as provided for under clauses 12 and 13. Where possible, the Police intend to streamline this process to obtain such permits.",19,19,012-002-093-004-002-019,30
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Let me now turn to clause 14 that deals with public drunkenness. Today, there are provisions under the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act and the Penal Code to curb offensive behaviour including being drunk and incapable of taking care of oneself, and being drunk and creating public annoyance or disorder. These provisions will be transferred to the new legislation, and they will attract similar penalties.",20,20,012-002-093-004-002-020,31
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"A person who is drunk and incapable is liable to a fine of $1,000, or an imprisonment term of one month, or both. The offence of drunk and creating public annoyance will result in a fine of up to $1,000, or imprisonment of six months, or both. And repeat offenders will face higher penalties. These are similar to the penalties under the current laws.",21,21,012-002-093-004-002-021,32
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"A definition of being ""drunk"" is also introduced under clause 14, to provide clarity on what Police take into consideration in assessing drunkenness. This, however, does not change the threshold that has to be met for an offence to be made out.",22,22,012-002-093-004-002-022,33
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Under current laws, the Police only have the power of arrest to deal with these offences. And understandably, the Police exercise this power of arrest only in the most egregious cases. Consequently, residents, as well as Members of this House have often raised the point that Police do not seem to be able to act when Police turn up in response to residents' complaints, and that the public drinking nuisance recurs when Police leave the scene. With the proposed Bill, the Police will be able to take a more calibrated set of enforcement measures based on the circumstances on the assessment of the situation. In particular, clauses 14, 21, 22 and 33 allow the Police to require information, require persons to dispose the liquor, issue orders to move on and leave the place, and issue composition fines in lieu of prosecution.",23,23,012-002-093-004-002-023,34

These powers can only be exercised upon reasonable suspicion that an offence has been committed.",24,24,012-002-093-004-002-024,35
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"With this range of powers, the Police will be able to intervene early and more effectively with calibrated enforcement to deal with nuisance related to public consumption of alcohol, and before drunken behaviour escalates into public disorder.",25,25,012-002-093-004-002-025,36
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Madam, another component of the Bill pertains to liquor licensing. The existing provisions on liquor licensing will be transferred from the Customs Act to the new law, and some changes made to the licensing framework.",26,26,012-002-093-004-002-026,37
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Clauses 4 to 7 provide for the regulation of the supply of liquor. Licensees are permitted to supply liquor only at premises and during trading hours specified in the licence. The Minister for Home Affairs will be empowered under the new law to prescribe trading hours that can override those specified in the licence. This effectively allows the Minister to prescribe shorter trading hours in areas that might pose a more significant risk of public disorder associated with the consumption of liquor. In line with the general restriction on the consumption of liquor in public places, the retail sale hours for take-away liquor will also be required to end at 10.30 pm. Requests for extension of sale hours beyond 10.30 pm will be considered on a case-by-case basis.",27,27,012-002-093-004-002-027,38

Under clauses 8 and 9, the Licensing Officer is empowered to grant, renew, suspend or cancel liquor licences in accordance with the object of the law. The Licensing Officer may also impose or vary licensing conditions in his or her discretion, after giving the licensee an opportunity to be heard. The Liquor Licensing Board will be renamed the Liquor Appeal Board as it will continue to hear appeals. This delineation of roles and responsibilities will ensure clear accountability.",28,28,012-002-093-004-002-028,39
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Clause 10 provides the basic powers of entry and search to allow enforcement officers to conduct checks on premises to ensure that the law is being complied with. In addition, in the event that there is a significant threat to public safety, order or peace, or if an offence involving violence is suspected to have been committed on the premises, the Commissioner of Police can, under clause 11, order the closure of the premises for up to 72 hours. He can order the licensee to take certain measures to mitigate the risks, and to vary the licence or suspend the licence until the significant threat or risk no longer exists or the remedial measures have been taken. This allows the Police to take swift action to mitigate many serious threats to public order.",29,29,012-002-093-004-002-029,40

In areas where there is a heightened risk of public disorder associated with liquor consumption, more stringent measures will be imposed to mitigate the risks. Clause 15 empowers the Minister to designate such areas as Liquor Control Zones.",31,31,012-002-093-004-002-031,42
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"As I explained earlier, based on Police's current operational assessment, there is, in general, a material number of cases or incidents of serious crimes or incidents involved with liquor consumption. And there is a disproportionate number of law and order incidents in Little India and Geylang that are associated with liquor consumption. The regular and large congregations of people, both local and foreign, in these areas exacerbate the risk.",32,32,012-002-093-004-002-032,43
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"To illustrate, about one-fifth of all rioting cases island-wide occur in Geylang and Little India. About 10% of serious hurt cases were in Geylang and Little India. Also, 40-50% of serious incidents in Geylang and Little India are linked to liquor consumption; and that is about twice the national average.",33,33,012-002-093-004-002-033,44
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran),"Hence, under the proposed Bill, specified areas in Little India and Geylang will be designated as Liquor Control Zones. Stricter restrictions on the hours for the supply and consumption of liquor, similar to those applied in Little India under the Public Order (Additional Temporary Measures) Act, will be implemented in these zones.",34,34,012-002-093-004-002-034,45

Liquor-related offences committed within the zones will result in a penalty of one and a half times that in non-designated areas. The Commissioner of Police will also be empowered to require a person to cease business activities in a Liquor Control Zone if he is found to have repeatedly supplied liquor without a valid licence from his premises. This prevents businesses from continuing to circumvent regulation and supplying liquor freely within the zones.",35,35,012-002-093-004-002-035,46

Residents in many areas want a more peaceful and orderly living environment, especially at night, even on weekends, when they and their families want to rest.

2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"   Mdm Speaker, the introduction of this Bill has met with strong responses â€“ both for and against. All the arguments made will likely be rehearsed in this House today. But once we drill down to the details, the conclusion is clear  everyone wants the same thing. We all want peace and quiet at night where we live. We all do not want the problems associated with irresponsible drinking, including the noise, the littering and the risk of bad or criminal behaviour. At the same time, we also want the freedom to relax and drink responsibly, whether in private or public.",1,43,012-002-093-004-002-043,54
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The real question for this House, therefore, is this  can we draft a law or pass a law which meets all these interests? Is there a sweet spot in the middle? And if we cannot â€“and this is the real test â€“ which side should the law lean in favour of, and are there any ways to mitigate the effects on the other side? In this case, where both sides have reasonable and legitimate concerns, it is not enough to say you agree or disagree with the law. You need to say how you propose to address the real concerns of the other side.",2,44,012-002-093-004-002-044,55

2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"First, if the concern is about alcohol-fuelled misconduct, are our current laws not already sufficient? And the answer is ""no"". Our laws criminalise some types of behaviour. For example, it is an offence for someone to be drunk and incapable of taking care of himself in a public place -- section 18 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act. It is also an offence for an intoxicated person to appear in a public place and cause annoyance to any person and that is section 510 of the Penal Code.",4,46,012-002-093-004-002-046,57
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"On paper, these appear adequate. But in reality, these do not go far enough. Take for instance the complaint I, and I am sure, many of us in this House often hear â€“ people gathering, drinking and making noise late at night at void decks or nearby sitting areas. The resident is disturbed from his rest. He bears the burden of calling the Police. The Police take time to respond as this is not an emergency situation. And when the Police arrive, they have very little power to do anything if the people are not intoxicated, because there is a difference between being high and loud on alcohol and being so drunk as to be incapable of taking care of oneself, or at least I am told.",5,47,012-002-093-004-002-047,58
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The Police have no power to tell them to leave, and even if they could, the drinkers will just end up in another part of the neighbourhood. So, the Police advise them to tone it down, they agree, and then they start up once again when the patrol car turns a corner, or they return again another night. The game plays itself out time and again. So, who suffers? The residents. Why should they have to put up with this? And do we really want vital Police resources to be taken up to deal with such issues?",6,48,012-002-093-004-002-048,59
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The second question  is this such a big problem? Some commentators have asked the Ministry to provide statistics. And if they are available, they should be shared. But realistically, I would be surprised if the data is meaningful precisely because many of these incidents, like the example I gave, do not involve criminal behaviour. And not everyone who is affected will call the Police. But I have received enough such complaints on my walkabouts and block visits about the ruckus caused by drinkers who gather at void decks or nearby benches to know that this is a real issue. Apart from the noise, residents are worried for the safety of their family members when coming home late. They are also angry about the trash that is left behind. Besides, the problem is particularly acute for families who live near popular gathering spots. So, the numbers are not going to tell the whole story or convey the real suffering these families put up with. In short, we cannot dismiss this as a fictitious problem or one that affects only a handful. Our residents have legitimate concerns that we should address.",7,49,012-002-093-004-002-049,60
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"Third, can we not just give the Police more enforcement powers? The answer is we can, but that will not solve the problem. Residents will still have to call the Police and be disturbed. And unless we expect the Police to arrest everyone who makes noise, it is simply not practical. Besides, who gets to define what is a disturbance, and if it is vague, how are the Police going to do their job? The Bill improves the current position as it makes enforcement simpler and clearer.",8,50,012-002-093-004-002-050,61
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"To put it another way, an offence framed in terms of consumption is better because it is difficult to draft an effective law in terms of conduct. But more importantly, with this law, I expect that there will be fewer incidents of people drinking past 10.30 pm in public places, and therefore, far fewer incidents of residents being disturbed.",9,51,012-002-093-004-002-051,62
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The fourth question  does this law curb personal liberties? Of course, it does. People will no longer have the freedom to drink in public places or to buy takeaway alcohol past 10.30 pm. But let us put things in perspective. The right to drink wherever you want and whenever you want is not a fundamental liberty. We have prohibitions against other types of behaviour where the public interest is affected. Smoking in public, for example, is heavily restricted and many people are glad for it. In the case of drinking, there is indisputably a public interest in ensuring that residents are not disturbed in their own homes.",10,52,012-002-093-004-002-052,63
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The Bill does not make us unique. Many jurisdictions have adopted partial restrictions comparable to these. London has Controlled Drinking Zones where police can request people to stop drinking alcohol and ask them to surrender their drink. In Adelaide, areas such as the CBD and parklands have been designated alcohol-free zones. Even in Rome, the Eternal City, public consumption of alcohol from glass bottles is banned from 10.00 pm to 7.00 am. And for all other alcohol, the ban begins at midnight. Some jurisdictions have even gone further  in New York City, Ontario, Oslo and Perth, public alcohol consumption is banned at all times.",11,53,012-002-093-004-002-053,64

The Bill does not stop people from drinking in coffee shops, restaurants, bars, clubs, private homes and at licensed events even after 10.30 pm.

2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh),"The problem then I think becomes one of legal definition. It is easy to say ""non-residential areas"", but that is very difficult to define, to rationalise and to enforce. This is important because there is no point having a law if people do not know where the prohibited areas are or how it will be enforced. It is easy to take out a map and circle areas which appear far enough from residential areas. But how do you reflect this on the ground? And you will have the absurd situation where the length of one foot step or the length of one stride is the difference between lawful and unlawful behaviour. And to paraphrase Charles Dickens â€“ the law should not be an ass.",15,57,012-002-093-004-002-057,68

I am in favour of leaning it on the side of folks who are affected by bad behaviour. But that should not be the end of the matter. We should also make sure that we do not make things difficult for people who drink responsibly. That should be in the way the law is implemented.",16,58,012-002-093-004-002-058,69

For example, take a person who is now required to get a liquor consumption permit to drink past 10.30 pm at, say, a BBQ event at East Coast.

Police officers, but not auxiliary police officers, have powers of arrest under section 30 of the Bill.

While the rest of us will not be allowed to drink in public places past 10.30 pm, we are free to drink in our homes. But that same consideration does not apply to foreign workers. Section 38(5) designates foreign worker dormitories as a public place for the purposes of section 14(1).",21,63,012-002-093-004-002-063,74

It may not have met everyone's expectations, with some quarters feeling that the Bill imposes disproportionate curbs on their personal liberty. Nevertheless, this Bill is a significant step forward for Singapore and brings us in line with practices of other major cities. It has put the necessary markers and framework in place to help the country move towards a culture of responsible alcohol consumption.

This officially strong support contrasted markedly against an informal Straits Times poll which revealed an opposite response. One day after the First Reading of the Bill in Parliament, 78% of 9,000 ST readers who participated in the poll disagreed with the proposed Bill.

2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"Firstly, the proposal to restrict the drinking of liquor to 10.30 pm at residential areas such as void decks is welcomed. This is borne out of the lived experience of many residents in various HDB estates. However, greater policy clarity is required for certain public areas like hawker centres which may not be situated in residential areas, and where the liquor consumption rules can be made subject to greater flexibility. For example, it is understood that liquor sale and consumption in places like coffee-shops would be subject to liquor licensing conditions and customers will be allowed to consume alcohol within these premises beyond the 10.30 pm guidelines, depending on the conditions of the respective licence.",9,94,012-002-093-004-002-094,105

2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied),"It follows that the operational implementation of the new liquor control measures should not be applied bluntly, painting every liquor retailer with the same brush. A flexible licensing regime can be accommodated as licensing officers are empowered with extensive powers to add or remove conditions from retail licences. This is conceivable in cases where community feedback, for example, determines that a certain retail outlet should stop the retail sale of liquor after a certain point and depending on the individual case even before 10.30 pm, if necessary. Such a regime puts self-regulation and community engagement in as a first step before regulation kicks in.

2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"  Mdm Speaker, I speak in support of this Bill. I first learnt about the problems related to the public consumption of alcohol very early on in my stint as a Member of Parliament. As soon as I did a block visit near one of the local shops, I was told, ""You have to stop liquor in this coffee-shop. People drink beyond the hours. They make a lot of noise. We cannot sleep. It is even worse at about two, three o'clock. There are no toilets and they urinate at the void deck"". This is a perennial problem. It continues. There are probably one or two tables of people at most who drink beyond the coffee-shop hours, but they create disamenities for the entire three or four blocks that are in that vicinity. The Police are called every now and then and that creates the ""cat and mouse game"" that some earlier speakers mention. They disappear for awhile and they come back later.",1,102,012-002-093-004-002-102,113
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"In that sense, this Bill addresses a very real concern for many residents are in the heartlands. It also addresses concerns for residents who live near the so-called hot spots, the party areas. Many people were saying that areas like Clarke Quay and so on should be permitted to be designated party areas. But my understanding is the local Member of Parliament there was probably one of the first to crusade against the sale of alcohol to the public in Clark Quay because of the public order issues. So, I believe that even in the so-called party areas, there is a necessity to limit unruly behaviour and public consumption of alcohol.",2,103,012-002-093-004-002-103,114

Of course, as soon as the Bill was announced, the immediate reaction perhaps from the more vocal group was quite different. Some of my colleagues came up to me and said ""So, do you support the anti-alcohol Bill?"" I answered, ""Anti-alcohol Bill - what does that exactly mean?"" Actually, we were talking about this Bill. Well, I said, ""I support the Bill. I do not quite think it is an anti-alcohol Bill"". So, then they said, ""Do you drink?"" ""Yes, I do, but not in public and not after 10.30 pm in open areas."" When you ask the next question to many of them, ""Do you actually drink on the bridge, drink at the void deck?"" They would say, ""No, actually we do not, but our right to do so has been taken away."" And they were quite indignant.",3,104,012-002-093-004-002-104,115

There is no one answer. You cannot have a perfect solution to deal with the two competing tendencies. On the one hand, people want the freedom to drink; on the other, people want the right to have a quiet and peaceful life at home. This Bill does do a good job in striking the right balance.",5,106,012-002-093-004-002-106,117
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Let me talk about the components of what I mean is the right balance. This Bill could have taken many different forms. In countries like Australia and the US, in many parts of those countries, there is a complete ban on public consumption of alcohol. In many parts of the US, you cannot even have an open bottle of alcohol on the street. That is one extreme that you could go to. We did not go that far. We only stopped the public consumption of alcohol between specific times â€“ between 10.30 pm and 7.00 am. And this is flexible. The Minister has the flexibility to amend those times, if necessary, at a later stage. So, we certainly did not go to the most extreme measure of banning public consumption of alcohol.",6,107,012-002-093-004-002-107,118
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I also think it plays an important part in allowing intervention before problems get serious. Right now, the current legislative framework allows you to intervene only when things go seriously wrong, if there is a public order issue, say a fight starts or there is affray or violence. Or in the other extreme where the person is incapable of taking care of himself after getting drunk. But there is nothing that allows you to intervene before we get there. So, you can have people getting very drunk in public areas, making some noise but not exactly committing an offence. That is when you have the problem with the Police coming by but not being able to do very much.",7,108,012-002-093-004-002-108,119

We definitely do not want another issue like that there. Certainly, the legislation is flexible enough for more special zones to be designated. In that sense, this legislation framework, I think, is broad and flexible enough for us to expand if necessary, or even cut back if necessary. If an area gets safer and there are less concerns, it may no longer need to be designated as a special zone.",11,112,012-002-093-004-002-112,123
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"One other aspect of this Bill that is quite interesting is that the Police have gradated powers of intervention. So, it is not envisioned that the first thing the Police would do is to go round and arrest someone for being caught with an opened bottle, as I think some scare-mongers were spreading. What they would probably do in the first instance is to tell people that they should move somewhere else, move back home, and that power is within the framework. If the person does not listen, then the Police have escalated powers. These powers are a step-up provisions and it is something that allows the Police to have some teeth but also give them the flexibility not to have to wield too heavy a stick. In that sense, I think this is quite an interesting component of the Bill that gives enough flexibility for the enforcement authorities to do what they feel it is necessary in a particular situation.",12,113,012-002-093-004-002-113,124
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"Like Mr Hri Kumar, I also share the concern about whether or not Police resources will be adequate to deal with this. I envision there will be a lot more complaints, at least when this Bill first comes about. And given the additional powers, there will probably be an expectation from residents that the Police will intervene. There might be expectations that the Police will have to come done very quickly to deal the issues relating to public consumption of alcohol.",13,114,012-002-093-004-002-114,125

As the public understands the new rules, behaviour normally changes. This is what has happened in places like Australia and the United States. And once behaviour changes, I do not think there will be need for an extended period of policing. But at least in the initial stage, I expect the Police will get a lot more complaints on this front.",14,115,012-002-093-004-002-115,126
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I have a few questions for the Minister as well. The first is, at the moment the designation of special zones, I understand the main concern with public order-related issues and Geylang and Little India have been designated as the main ones, but are there any other zones that the Minister thinks we should be keeping a look out for based on these public order statistics? Anecdotally, different people have mentioned different names. I will not mention any here but I am just curious of whether or not there is a range of places that have been monitored and whether others may also be designated based on these public order concerns.",15,116,012-002-093-004-002-116,127
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"The second is whether the Minister might consider a slightly more flexible framework in the future.

One area that has been mentioned quite commonly is the beaches or, at the very least, the barbeque pits at beaches.",16,117,012-002-093-004-002-117,128
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang),"I can understand why the Minister would not want to designate this as a purely an area where drink is allowed at all times just in case that becomes a congregation area for anyone who wants to drink, including foreign workers and everyone else. But I can see a fair argument in favour of maybe slightly longer hours, say, at the barbeque pits at East Coast Park, up to midnight or something because that is quite far away from the public and that is the place where people ordinarily gather to have drinks and parties. This could even be tied up to, say, the booking of the barbeque pits if you want to restrict it even more.

This Bill is the result of a one-year long public consultation by the Ministry of Home Affairs to counter problems caused by public drinking.

As these are randomly selected Singaporeans and Permanent Residents, and data had been weighted to ensure it represented the demographics of Singapore, it does show that the majority of the general public is supportive of such a law. However, most netizens have painted a different picture. Just on my own social media pages, I have received comments such as ""This law is silly"", ""Singapore is again a nanny state, with a drinking curfew"", ""It is nice to know that the Government wants to take care of us but please don't treat us as small kids"".

2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"While I have no issue with stopping retail alcohol sales at 10.30 pm, I do not think that it is necessary to ban alcohol consumption in for all public areas from 10.30 pm to 7.00 am. Generally, most drinkers here are responsible. Singaporeans do not have a drinking problem. To deal with the minority who create trouble, the Bill is taking pre-emptive measures several steps upstream. One drinks in public after 10.30 pm, one might get drunk, hence, one might end up with anti-social undesirable behaviour, therefore, no public drinking after 10.30 pm. Perhaps, the solution is not a ban but increase our efforts in public education. The focus should also be on managing the law breakers instead of imposing a blanket law. Or we could reduce the number of retail stores that could sell alcohol, especially in residential areas.",4,123,012-002-093-004-002-123,134
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"So, while the good intent of this Bill is clear, it, unfortunately, sends a dampening message. Therefore, Madam, I would like to make a suggestion. Instead of a nationwide ban, we could increase the number of Liquor Control Zones. In addition to Little India and Geylang, other areas may include Clarke Quay, Boat Quay, Chinatown, Golden Mile Complex and locations with existing problems of frequent public nuisances due to drinking. The law could empower the Minister to designate additional areas as Liquor Control Zones as and when necessary.",5,124,012-002-093-004-002-124,135
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines),"We hear the problem of displacement. So, therefore, the Ministry may consider increasing the buffer zone by between 500 meters to one kilometre. The Little India Liquor Control Zone has a well-delineated border surrounded by commercial and Government buildings which contains potential displacement. For example, a 500-metre buffer zone around Little India would cover areas up to Orchard Road, Kallang Road, Boon Keng Road and the CTE. It is unlikely that people who frequent Little India for the shops, services and activities would spill over to these areas just to drink in public. The Geylang Zone, however, may benefit from an enlarged buffer zone in the north and south as there are a number of residences beyond Sims Avenue and Guillemard Road.",6,125,012-002-093-004-002-125,136

Regulations should spell out clearly under what circumstances an application would be rejected. It should also be made clear what constitutes a public place, for example, are chalets public or private places?

So the aim of this Bill is to control the latter, not the former. Some people take to drinking to forget their sorrows but they get even more sorrowful. We also do not want people to live a befuddled life, getting drunk whenever alcohol is available or to be emboldened by alcohol to commit dangerous acts. To have a few drinks, get slightly tipsy but still in full control of oneself is a good way to be relaxed and to enjoy life.",8,127,012-002-093-004-002-127,138

But after 1 April, after 10.30 pm, you can only do so in licensed coffee shops, restaurants and bars. Some low-income people may not be able to afford this. Of course, you can drink at home but you must buy the alcohol before 10.30 pm.",9,128,012-002-093-004-002-128,139

Currently, when organisations such as temples, community or commercial groups apply for a permit, they have to agree to end their activities by 10.30 pm. However, there would usually be auction of items at such events; people can get enthusiastic and it would overrun past 10.30 pm sometimes. The organiser will tone down the volume after 10 30 pm so that it will not disturb the nearby residents. People are generally tolerant of this.",10,129,012-002-093-004-002-129,140

From the feedback that I have gathered from the business community, their reaction has generally been positive. Businesses, including the most affected ones such as the mini-marts, share the same concerns as the Government about public order, safety and anti-social behaviour arising from public drinking. The coffee shop operators are also relieved that the Government did not shorten the hours stated on their existing liquor licences, and recognised that they need to smartly manage their operations on the ground in order to comply with the law. However, having said this, we hope the Government can find a balance between achieving public security, being pro-business and maintaining Singapore's tourism appeal.",2,134,012-002-093-004-002-134,145

In the past year or so, the liquor licences of about 40 coffee shops in Geylang have been revoked, and the reason is because they have contravened the regulations. Inspectors have found people drinking in their premise outside the hours stipulated on their licence. Because their liquor licences have been revoked, their business is down by 20% to 30%, and they do not know whether they are going to get their licence back eventually, or it has been permanently revoked. These businesses hope that the Government can give them a clear answer so that they can adjust their business if necessary.",6,138,012-002-093-004-002-138,149
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member),"Second, our members suggested introducing a demerit point system. If they really contravene the regulations, we suggest that the inspector issue a written warning upon the first violation, instead of the current practice of informing the business only when their licence is about to be revoked. The businesses hope that with this demerit point system, they will have a point deducted for each offence and at each offence a written warning will be given. When all the points have been deducted, then the licence will be revoked. This measure will have a strong warning effect to the businesses, reminding them not to contravene the regulations. The consequences can also be seen clearly. Compared to the current practice, the demerit point system is more transparent and will help the operators to exercise self-discipline.",7,139,012-002-093-004-002-139,150

Of course, the business operators have to comply with the laws strictly, but the drinkers who have repeatedly violated the rules should also be severely dealt with. Hence, the businesses hope that the Government will use different channels to educate the public on the Bill. From past experiences, although the operators have reminded their customers to buy and consume their liquor before midnight, there are still some customers who refuse to listen to them.

Singapore is a global metropolis. There are many flights to and from Singapore and tourists arrive round the clock. When the new Bill comes into effect, no drinking will be allowed at public places after 10.30 pm, which aims to reduce the potential threat to public order. Many of the nightlife places frequented by tourists have liquor licence which allows them to sell liquor up until 3.00 am or 4.00 am. They hope that this can be extended to 6.00 am. Many places start the merrymaking after midnight. Stop selling liquor at 3.00 am or 4.00 am does seem a bit early.",9,141,012-002-093-004-002-141,152

It is also being viewed as too paternalistic. In the past, most supermarkets or hypermarkets close at 10.00 pm.

I would like to urge MHA to be more lenient in granting permission for supermarkets to sell alcohol beyond 10.30 pm, especially for hypermarkets that are not too near to housing estate.

For example, the Police could consider developing a smart phone application for Singaporeans to snap photographs of people violating the alcohol restrictions and send these to the Police via the app. This is similar to the app developed by the Municipal Service Office or MSO. The photographs snapped by the smart phone will reveal the date, time and place where the photo is taken using the Global Positioning System or GPS technology. To deter frivolous submissions, only registered user logging in with SingPass password will be allowed to send violation photographs via the app. And such submissions will also allow the Police to track public feedback and identify problem areas where the public is most concerned with.",9,194,012-002-093-004-002-194,205

However, it should be accompanied by tight enforcement of the law and the phone app is one of the ways the Police could involve the community to assist in the enforcement. In this way, offenders know that the chances of being caught are high, and thus serving as a strong deterrent. At the same time, the Police could also be compassionate towards first time offenders, giving them prior warning before prosecution. Many first time offenders may be ignorant of the law or have committed the act out of carelessness. But we know that the recalcitrant should not be condoned.",10,195,012-002-093-004-002-195,206

Sometimes, after a long day of work, all they want to do is to grab a can of beer -- not high in alcohol content anyway in one can of beer -- sit quietly by the river alone or with a close friend and indulge in simple pleasures. For some, especially younger Singaporeans, going to a coffee shop for a beer does not exactly offer the ambience they desire and going to a bar or pub can be too costly for them. Therefore, with this Bill, this group of Singaporeans will inevitably feel deprived of the freedom they had and unfairly penalised because of a group of irresponsible drinkers.",3,235,012-002-093-004-002-235,246
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade),"In contrast, the first group of Singaporeans had experienced or recognised the disamenities that irresponsible drinkers can bring. Most commonly known to Members in this House is perhaps how residents suffer from the incessant noise made by drinkers who drank at the void deck or small pavilions in the neighbourhood, got drunk and made merry without any inhibition or regard for others. Apart from noise, some of these irresponsible drinkers engaged in destructive acts of mischief, damaging public and private properties while being drunk. In less disruptive but rather annoying instances, these drinkers drank in public areas where toilets are too far for their drunken selves to reach, and thus, decided to pee in public. HDB residents' complaints about stairwells frequently reeking of pungent urine smell are aplenty and this is despite best efforts by the Town Councils to clean up every morning. Installation of CCTVs â€“ one suggestion that has been frequently made by residents â€“ cannot effectively solve the problem as the culprits simply move up one more floor or move to another stairwell to do it. The problem persists.",4,236,012-002-093-004-002-236,247

However, the difference is the preventive, albeit blunt, nature of this Bill. The Police cannot take enforcement actions unless the person has already been confirmed to have committed the offensive act. Even so, there is a certain threshold that must be met before actions can be effectively taken to penalise the offender. However, by that time, disturbances and damages would have already been committed. For residents who have to suffer this repeatedly every day or every other day, and coupled with the fact that they live there and, therefore, they cannot escape from these disamenities, the feeling is pretty miserable. Whereas, this Bill can be seen as addressing these problems upstream and, hopefully, minimise the risk of such disamenities adversely affecting the quality of life for the general resident population.",5,237,012-002-093-004-002-237,248

The need to have tighter alcohol controls stems largely from the density of human activity in Singapore.

Over the last few years, the increased density of population has seen alcohol-related public nuisances and disorder spill over into residential spaces, affecting the quality of life in neighbourhoods.",3,249,012-002-093-004-002-249,260

2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Another concern is community events where alcohol is served, such as Seventh Month dinners, a point touched on by Mr Baey Yam Keng earlier. While the permits or permission for such events require the events to stop at 10.30 pm, it is common in these social gatherings for bottles of alcohol to be shared in the course of the evening. Even after the events formally end, it is common for attendees to stay back to quietly finish up their drinks together after 10.30 pm. To now say it is illegal to drink after 10.30 pm would mean everyone would have to either waste their drinks or to drink up to meet the timeline, which will be harmful and an overkill.

Let me touch on the proposed prohibition against sales after 10.30 pm for take-away consumption. This will be stipulated by Police as a licensing condition for alcohol retailers. Currently, most retailers of alcohol for off-premise consumption are able to sell alcohol until midnight, for example, convenience stores, supermarkets and petrol stations. I am not convinced that this should change. Many consumers purchase alcohol for take-away between 10.30 pm and 12 midnight to drink at home or to bring along to social gatherings at the homes of relatives and friends. Since alcohol consumption in public after 10.30 pm will soon be outlawed, one will no longer be permitted to hang around a public place to consume alcohol after 10.30 pm. Therefore, the main concern about disamenities caused by public drinking late at night would have been significantly addressed.",8,254,012-002-093-004-002-254,265

Under clause 12(4), such an individual commits an offence of prohibited consumption. How will the Police handle this? Would the Police just ask the person to leave with no questions asked or will records be kept? As for persons found drunk and incapable, or drunk and causing annoyance, clause 14(3) seems to favour an approach of just directing the person to go away and pouring away the alcohol. Are there expected to be further follow-up steps after these or will the authorities prosecute only when persons do not comply with directions of the Police to leave the place?",13,259,012-002-093-004-002-259,270
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied),"Another matter of interest is the division of work between the Police and the auxiliary police. The Act distinguishes between Police officers and the auxiliary police, the latter of whom are termed ""approved persons"" under clause 3 of the Bill. While there are some powers under the Bill that can be used by both Police and auxiliary police, under clause 30 of the Bill, only a Police officer may arrest without warrant a person committing an offence in the Police officer's line of sight. Thus, if an offence of drunken trespass under clause 14 is committed in front of auxiliary police officers, it would seem that these auxiliary officers cannot arrest the suspect but can only direct the suspect to leave the place. If he does not, it is not clear what, if anything, the auxiliary police officers can do at the scene.",14,260,012-002-093-004-002-260,271

During the Committee of Inquiry into the Little India riots, the then-Commissioner of Police spoke about the policing challenges in Geylang and noted that there was open hostility and antagonism towards the Police in Geylang.

However, once this is done, I believe that we can retain the status quo for take-away sales. We also need to ensure that those who are enforcing the provisions of the Bill act with reason and discretion, and that the auxiliary police are adequately trained.",21,267,012-002-093-004-002-267,278

Those who gave their feedback to me felt that we should exercise more flexibility so that these foreign workers can relax with their work colleagues to recover from fatigue and work stresses. Therefore, it would be good if, for the consumption of liquor within these foreign worker dormitories, it is left to the dorm operators to establish their own conditions.",4,271,012-002-093-004-002-271,282

This approach has been implemented in several cities like New York, Sydney, Perth and Oslo. Allowing the consumption of liquor during the hours before 10.30 pm can still bring about problems related to liquor consumption like drunkenness, brawls and indiscriminate littering. Therefore, in their opinion, it will be better to ban the consumption of liquor in all public areas at all times.",5,272,012-002-093-004-002-272,283

This is a reasonable request because this Bill has already banned the consumption of liquor in public areas during certain hours. Therefore, why impose the ban on liquor sales on these retailers after 10.30 pm? Some feel that this ban will burden the lower and middle income groups who want to consume liquor in their homes after 10.30 pm because the prices of liquor in the retail shops are much lower than the prices at the coffee shops in the housing estates.",6,273,012-002-093-004-002-273,284

They feel that businesses are already facing challenges due to the labour shortage and rising cost, and to ban liquor consumption after 10.30 pm will cause a chain reaction. If the customers who are used to drinking outdoors do not go out, take a taxi, order food or consume anything, then not only will the retail business be affected, other businesses may also be adversely affected.

The reason is that the dinners usually start at 8.30 pm, and because there is the bidding of items, it is difficult to finish before 10.30 pm. They hope that as long as they do not disturb the residents nearby, the Police and authorities should allow them to go beyond 10 30 pm to early morning so that the committee members can have some time together after the event, have a bit of drink and discuss the affairs of the temple and bidding matters.

As such, calibrating the restriction measures is definitely not an easy process. Stakeholders' needs need to be balanced and the interests are quite diverse and sometimes conflicting. Having been involved in the focus group discussions from the early stages, trying to find a balance definitely has not been easy. The two-stage public consultation by the Ministry of Home Affairs and REACH ended in August 2014 and the feedback obtained called for ""measures to reduce threats to public safety and order, and mitigate disamenities associated with the sale and consumption of alcohol in public places"".",6,319,012-002-093-004-002-319,330

I am also glad that rather than a far more restrictive system that exists in other legislation, this Bill has taken on feedback and calibrated it as such. For example, there has been concern by seven-month organisers as well as temple groups that a formal restrictive system would curtail their activities. And therefore I am glad that the 10.30 pm timing matches the permit that is given to them to organise their activities. I am also glad that despite our lack of any famous nightspots in Yew Tee, our friendly neighbourhood coffee-shops are not adversely affected by this Bill.",7,320,012-002-093-004-002-320,331

Our towns have developed quite a fair bit over the years. Our landscape has changed. The distinctions between residential and commercial areas are getting blur, and they have started to merge as well. This really means that it will be difficult at times to designate clear zones.

We have also had other forms of serious hurt cases, twice a week, which have also been attributed to liquor-induced practice.

The question then arises how do we go about it, and in particular, when does a Bill stop being blunt and over-reached? And when does it start being comprehensive and effective?

But while enforcement may be an important factor, it is by no means the solution in total and it is only one part of the equation. We must address the issues of consumption and sale of liquor in order to set expectations and foster a culture of shared responsibility introspect to this matter. It is equally important â€“ which Mr Alex Yam has in fact emphasised â€“ it is equally important that individuals and the community take responsibility and exercise restraint.

We cannot predict exactly where it might occur next. There were also strong calls based on consultation to restrict liquor consumption at void decks, parks, and other common places in residential areas. If we were to draw zones around these areas, the boundaries and rules will be confusing and to say, the least, ambiguous. I think, in extremis, you will probably need a GPS enabled app to guide you as you move around, in which zone and what rules apply.

The Police's record of past incidents shows that the bulk of liquor-induced violence and disamenities happen at night, after 10.30 pm. We can fine-tine this and get down to the last half hour and so on, but that is a general marker. It also aligns with the end-time for many activities we have in the community, as we have all discussed, whether it is getai, whether it is Hungry Ghost Festival or the Seventh Month dinners, and so on. The restriction will not stop people from congregating and consuming liquor in public before 10.30 pm, but it does reduce the window period when people typically consume liquor, because after 10.30 pm, we have the restriction. It greatly reduces the propensity of them becoming drunk and creating noise disturbances when residents are resting later in the night. The correlation is real and I would say that wherever you draw the line, whether it is 10.00 pm, 10.30 pm, 12 midnight, there will always be a debate about why not before, why not later.",16,348,012-002-093-004-002-348,359

The first point I want to make is you cannot decouple consumption from the sale of retail with public consumption. Imagine in extremis the scenario where you have total ban on public consumption but total freedom for retail sales, do you think that is tenable solution? So, you need to start somewhere because those who buy retail sales do not all go home and drink, or at least, there will be a temptation to do other things. So, we do need to have some reference points.",17,349,012-002-093-004-002-349,360
2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr S Iswaran,"Madam, unlike in coffee shops, restaurants and bars where the licensees are responsible to ensure that liquor is not served to patrons who already appear intoxicated, the consumption of take-away liquor is often unchecked. As many Members have highlighted, the problem is exacerbated by easy access to take-away liquor sold in nearby shops. So, a curb on the supply will reduce the propensity of drinkers obtaining liquor and consuming it in public late at night. This has been an effective measure in other cities. Does it mean that there would be no gaming around the end times? Probably not. But that does not mean that we should not take a position on this, which we think it is sensible and consistent with the large objectives that we have set out to achieve.",18,350,012-002-093-004-002-350,361

2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr S Iswaran,"I want to clarify a point which several Members have raised on foreign worker dormitories. The ""public place"" seen in clause 38 of this Bill relates to a consequential amendment to the Foreign Employee Dormitories Act, which was passed in this House two weeks ago. Under the Act, the Ministry of Manpower had decided that dormitories should be deemed as ""public places"" solely for the purpose of the provision relating to drunkenness under section 18 of the Miscellaneous Offences Act. As this provision will be transferred to this Bill, we need a consequential amendment under this Bill.",32,364,012-002-093-004-002-364,375

That is not the object of this Bill. The amendment does not turn dormitories into ""public places"", neither does it forbid workers from consuming liquor within the foreign worker dormitories. Workers can continue to drink in their private quarters according to whatever rules they have within their dorms. Some dorms have varying rules on this matter in terms of where their private quarters are. And they can also continue to drink in the beer gardens in their dormitories until such time as it is allowed under the licence. So, we will license the areas; there are these today, and those areas will continue to be available to the workers. So, it will not unduly constrain foreign workers in the dorms.",33,365,012-002-093-004-002-365,376

The Police will focus their enforcement on areas where there are public disorder and disamenities associated with the consumption of liquor, and take even-handed actions. It is certainly not the intent of this Bill to seek out every person who is consuming liquor peacefully in a remote place. I do not think the Police have the resources for this.

Where an individual is suspected of having committed an offence related to liquor consumption and drunkenness, and has hidden the liquor among his personal belongings including his clothing, clause 22 allows enforcement officers to inspect his belongings for any incriminating evidence.

I want to make the point that while restricting the number of licences is one of the tools available, the number of licences in an area per se may not truly reflect the situation on the ground because you may have one licensee who behaves irresponsibly, you may have many licensees who actually are very compliant and are responsible in the way they conduct their sales. So, the closure of any one shop will not necessarily reduce the overall problem on the ground. But what we will do â€“ and the Police will do â€“ is we will assess the situation in a locality and consider which levers are to be used, including whether there should be restrictions on the number of licences.",44,376,012-002-093-004-002-376,387

Earlier in his round-up speech, he was saying that hawker centres were treated under the same regime as coffee shops. I would like him to clarify that because in the literature of the MHA statements, they put coffee shops as licensed premises but in some of the FAQs we have seen, hawker centres appear not to be licensed premises but I am not sure whether those stallholders selling drinks there are considered to be retailers or off-premise consumption.

2015-01-30,Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Bill,012-002-093-004-002,Mr S Iswaran,"   Madam, first on the issue of hawker centres, the licence does not apply to hawker centres as a whole but particular shops will receive the licence. If I remember correctly, they are given a beer licence or a beer house licence, and the requirement is that the consumption takes place on the premises, meaning within the hawker centre. What that means in practice is if a shop in a hawker centre is to sell a can of beer, they are required to pop the can, so that there is a point made about consumption on premises. So, that is the basis on which the licensing is conducted. In that sense, it is similar to coffee shops and they have prescribed times and so on for their operations.",1,393,012-002-093-004-002-393,404

Is that her point? Basically, the Seventh Month dinners are required, by permit and the licence they have, to end by 10.30 pm. I think the Member's point is that these inevitably spill over, and we are aware of this situation on the ground. That is why I have made the point that for these kinds of activities, because our object is to minimise the impact on normal activities and the Seventh Month dinners would constitute that, we will see how best to facilitate that. Perhaps, in the application process â€“ because they will need a permit if they are going to hold it in a public area â€“ we can embed this requirement in there as well.
