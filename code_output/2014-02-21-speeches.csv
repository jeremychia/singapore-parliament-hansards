2014-02-21,Delay in Issuance of Notices of Traffic Offences,012-001-091-005-001,The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs),"  Mdm Speaker, in 2012 and 2013, the Traffic Police issued a total of 614,000 notices of traffic offences to motorists for violations committed within this period. About 0.15%, or 900, of such notices were issued more than a year from the date when the offence was committed. The majority involve complex cases where protracted investigations were required to determine the appropriate action to take against the parties involved.",1,2,012-001-091-005-001-002,2

This could be because the registered vehicle owner or the offender did not report a change in his address thereby necessitating further checks, or the registered owner did not furnish the Traffic Police with the particulars of the offender in a timely manner.",2,3,012-001-091-005-001-003,3

2014-02-21,Government's Monkey-trapping Protocols,012-001-091-005-002,Ms Faizah Jamal,asked,1,1,012-001-091-005-002-001,8
2014-02-21,Government's Monkey-trapping Protocols,012-001-091-005-002,The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman) (for the Minister of National Development),"  Mdm Speaker, all contractors engaged by the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) must comply with AVA's guidelines on the capture, handling and transportation of the monkeys. They can only carry out control operations at designated areas, and use methods and equipment approved by AVA. During these operations, they must be on-site to monitor the trap and to remove the trapped monkeys as soon as possible. AVA also conducts random checks on its contractors to ensure their compliance to the guidelines.",1,2,012-001-091-005-002-002,9
2014-02-21,Government's Monkey-trapping Protocols,012-001-091-005-002,The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman) (for the Minister of National Development),"AVA is investigating the case involving its contractor who used rubbish bins as monkey traps, as reported in the media. AVA allows the use of rubbish bins as traps as they do not cause any harm to the monkeys during the capture. The bins are no different from other equipment such as cages, and could be more effective in capturing monkeys which have grown wary of cages.",2,3,012-001-091-005-002-003,10
2014-02-21,Government's Monkey-trapping Protocols,012-001-091-005-002,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"  Mdm Speaker, I have three supplementary questions. Given the fact that the recent incident actually happened near Upper Pierce Reservoir, which is a nature reserve, whereas the actual reason for culling is meant for residential areas, does it mean then that the permit lacks clarity as to what they can and cannot do? Perhaps they are to be given proper oral instructions from AVA?",1,4,012-001-091-005-002-004,11
2014-02-21,Government's Monkey-trapping Protocols,012-001-091-005-002,Ms Faizah Jamal (Nominated Member),"If I could get some clarification as to how much does AVA each trapper and if there is any indication that I can get on how many monkeys have been culled over the last year. Finally, what is the long-term strategy that AVA is planning instead of culling? Particularly in this case, where if you think about it, rubbish bins are actually a lot more cruel than cages, which at least have some kind of ventilation, and which provides some safety for the animal as well as for the public at large who happened to be passing by these public areas.",2,5,012-001-091-005-002-005,12
2014-02-21,Government's Monkey-trapping Protocols,012-001-091-005-002,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"  Madam, I think there were several questions there. First, on the safety of the animals and the bins, the bin is one of the approved methods and that is not the only one that has used in Singapore; we use cages. As I have said, monkeys do get familiar and cages are a lot more apparent to them when you put the baits around the cage. The bin traps are also used by the authorities in Hong Kong and they have proven to be affective.",1,6,012-001-091-005-002-006,13
2014-02-21,Government's Monkey-trapping Protocols,012-001-091-005-002,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"AVA gives clear guidelines to its contractors and there are guidelines for the capture, the handling and transportation of the animals. We try to minimise the discomfort to the animals when the animals are captured. The contactors are expected to be onsite. The moment they set up the traps, the way the bin trays work, is that the spring is at the bottom of the bin. We put baits there and when the animal goes in, and they press on the string, the cover is closed. The contractors are nearby. They are supposed to immediately bring the monkeys to the AVA for inspection.",2,7,012-001-091-005-002-007,14
2014-02-21,Government's Monkey-trapping Protocols,012-001-091-005-002,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"We are very mindful of the welfare and the well being of the animals. At the same time, on the question on where they site the traps, the Member is right. We do not send them to the nature reserves. Some of these monkeys are very fast. The contractors are giving the site where the feedback was given, and oftentimes, this is near the residential areas. They will not go into the nature reserves but they set up traps where there are feedback of the sighting of monkeys and the nuisance that has been created by the monkeys.",3,8,012-001-091-005-002-008,15
2014-02-21,Government's Monkey-trapping Protocols,012-001-091-005-002,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"To the question of how many has been captured by AVA, I think in the region of about 500 has been captured. In 2013 alone, AVA received about 1,800 feedback from the public related to monkeys. I do not think that is a small number. On average, that is about five feedback a day. I think we take it quite seriously.",4,9,012-001-091-005-002-009,16
2014-02-21,Government's Monkey-trapping Protocols,012-001-091-005-002,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,We want to strike a balance between the nuisance that's created by monkeys and the way we treat the monkeys in relation to how do we manage the co-existence of the monkeys and human beings. We hope that they continue to be in the nature reserves and continue to be there. The more they come out of that space and intrude on the space of our residents - and our residents are giving us those feedback – we get concerned about that.,5,10,012-001-091-005-002-010,17
2014-02-21,Government's Monkey-trapping Protocols,012-001-091-005-002,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"In the longer term, we have to try to work with animal welfare groups to ask for their cooperation also to help us mange some of these challenges. Our residents need to also understand how to manage the monkey nuisance, but really, it is very tough. We live in an urban environment. Many of our youngsters grow up in an urban setting, not quite used to such intrusions, if I may call it.",6,11,012-001-091-005-002-011,18
2014-02-21,Government's Monkey-trapping Protocols,012-001-091-005-002,Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman,"The Member also asked about the long-term plans of AVA. AVA looks at it on both perspective  looking at the welfare and well being of the animals, at the same time, understanding the concerns and responding to the feedback that I have received by the residents when it comes to the monkey nuisance.",7,12,012-001-091-005-002-012,19

2014-02-21,Total Tuition Study Grants Given to International Students who Defaulted on Repayment,012-001-091-005-003,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"For those who graduated between 2010 and 2013, about eight in 10 international students who received tuition grants in our polytechnics and autonomous universities had either started serving their tuition grant bonds promptly upon graduation and contribute immediately to Singapore's economy, or have been granted approval by MOE to defer their service obligation to pursue further studies. This does not mean that the remaining international students are in default. Some did not start work immediately upon graduation as they have gone overseas for further study but did not seek deferment approval from MOE, some are in the midst of seeking deferment approval, and some are still seeking employment.",2,3,012-001-091-005-003-003,22
2014-02-21,Total Tuition Study Grants Given to International Students who Defaulted on Repayment,012-001-091-005-003,The Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat),"MOE has in place bond tracking and enforcement measures to track tuition grant recipients for bond fulfilment. However, the current tracking and enforcement efforts need to be tightened to facilitate more immediate and closer tracking of tuition grant recipients who had not yet started work upon graduation, or who have not sought formal approval for deferment. As MOE is tightening the processes and tracking is still in progress, the final figures are not currently available.",3,4,012-001-091-005-003-004,23

2014-02-21,Progress Updates on Trans-Pacific Partnership and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership,012-001-091-005-004,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),"  Mdm Speaker, both the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) are envisioned as high-quality agreements to deepen regional economic integration. They serve as possible pathways to an eventual Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP).",1,2,012-001-091-005-004-002,31
2014-02-21,Progress Updates on Trans-Pacific Partnership and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership,012-001-091-005-004,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),TPP negotiations started in March 2010 and there have been 19 formal negotiating rounds to date. The last TPP Ministerial was held in Singapore in December 2013. The Ministers had a good discussion on the potential way forward for many outstanding issues in the text. TPP ministers will be meeting again this month from 22 – 25 February 2014 and we expect further progress to be made.,2,3,012-001-091-005-004-003,32
2014-02-21,Progress Updates on Trans-Pacific Partnership and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership,012-001-091-005-004,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),The RCEP negotiations only commenced in May 2013. The third round of negotiations was recently held in Kuala Lumpur from 20 – 24 January 2014. Negotiations on a broad range of issues under the scope of the proposed agreement are thus still at a relatively early stage. The fourth negotiating round will be held in China in April 2014.,3,4,012-001-091-005-004-004,33
2014-02-21,Progress Updates on Trans-Pacific Partnership and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership,012-001-091-005-004,The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang),"Both the TPP and RCEP are designed to be open and inclusive agreements. Any APEC economy interested to join the TPP, including China, will have to initiate and complete bilateral consultations with existing TPP Parties and secure a consensus agreement for its membership. However, as negotiations intensify and TPP Parties focus on finalising the agreement, prospective members will have less time to conclude those consultations. Nonetheless, as the world's second largest economy and a key link in the Asia Pacific's supply chains, China can contribute to regional economic integration should it decide to join the TPP.",4,5,012-001-091-005-004-005,34

We also contribute where we can to facilitate the process. For example, Singapore hosted the TPP Ministerial Meeting in December 2013, and over the next four days. We also hosted some of the earlier negotiating Rounds -- Round 16 in March 2013 and Round 6 in March 2010.",6,7,012-001-091-005-004-007,36

Indeed, the TPP started out as the P4 FTA, otherwise known as the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership (TPSEP), comprising Singapore, Brunei, Chile and New Zealand. Singapore, together with the founding members, actively brought onboard other like-minded countries, starting with the USA in 2008. Today, there are 12 members in the TPP.",7,8,012-001-091-005-004-008,37

As we work expeditiously towards their conclusion, Singapore remains firmly guided by the need to ensure that these plurilateral FTAs contribute towards strengthening the multilateral trading system. In this way, we reaffirm rather than detract from the primacy of global free trade.",8,9,012-001-091-005-004-009,38

That is the general rule.

Yes, there have been complaints but the complaints are rather small in perspective. For example, last year, HDB received 60 cases of feedback on noise disturbances from 24 hours coffeeshops. This is about 5% of the 1,200 coffeeshops that there are altogether. There is less than 1% complaints about 24 hours supermarkets. These are manageable. But we also realise that for specific stores and supermarkets, there may be repeated infringement. In those cases, we really got to work very closely with the advisors and grassroots organisations to ensure that the business owners know what is the requirement, and HDB will enforce those requirements.",3,8,012-001-091-005-005-008,48

First, we have conducted briefings to the shipping community to reinforce the importance of safety of navigation in Singapore waters. We had the first briefing on 13 February. We are also promulgating the Port Marine and Shipping Circulars to the shipping and hovercraft communities, emphasising the importance of navigational safety and maintaining vigilance while navigating. The POCC also broadcasts messages to these vessels at any point in time when necessary to remind them of safety aspects while navigating. At the same time, we are working with a few organisations and countries to develop a safe passage guide for all mariners navigating in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. These efforts will make our waters safer for navigation and we will keep on bringing home the message that safety is key. As soon as our investigation findings are ready, we will share it with the shipping community.",4,9,012-001-091-005-006-009,57

We will create a Pioneer Generation Fund for the purpose and set aside $8 billion into the Fund. The $8 billion, with accumulated interest over time, will be enough to pay for the full projected cost of the package, including a buffer for inflation10.

Our spending needs will grow significantly in the next 10 to 15 years. Investments in infrastructure, such as HDB estate renewal, MRT expansion, and Changi Airport Terminal 5 will accelerate. Government healthcare spending for the population as a whole will grow, quite apart from the extra benefits we are providing the Pioneer Generation. We are also spending more on education. On pre-schools, in the next five years, we are spending an additional $1.5 billion. We are expanding university education and enhancing the polytechnic and ITE pathways.

MAS has published a consumer alert12 to warn Singaporeans about these risks. Unlike legal tender such as the Singapore Dollar, which is issued and backed by the Government, there is no legal obligation for individuals or businesses to accept virtual currencies.

Many countries have likewise warned of the risks of accepting or trading in virtual currencies.

The morning and afternoon shifts last 7 hours each, and the night shift lasts 10 hours, which usually includes two to three hours of low traffic volume during the night.

Thus far, we have not observed significant economic disruptions resulting from the unrest in Thailand. Supply chains remain mostly in place and Singaporean companies in Thailand have not encountered major disruptions to their operations, although they reported a slight drop in overall business volumes. However, businesses also take political and security considerations into account.
