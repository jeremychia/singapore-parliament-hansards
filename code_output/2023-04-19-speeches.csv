2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"  Sir, Singapore’s growth from third world to first within a generation has been nothing short of remarkable. Through the triumphs and tribulations, our forefathers have forged a nation not just through resilience but also unity.",1,6,014-002-095-099-001-006,6
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"The responsibility to bring Singapore forward now lies upon our shoulders. We face challenges and opportunities like our forefathers, though of a different nature amidst evolving ideologies and complexities. The popular saying is that it is easier to grow an organisation but always harder to keep up its successes. So, it is, all the more, that we must be alert not to succumb to complacency.",2,7,014-002-095-099-001-007,7
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"For me, the prorogation and our President’s Address provided valuable opportunities for introspection as a first-term Member of Parliament (MP); and today, I summarise my reflections in three key themes.",3,8,014-002-095-099-001-008,8
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"The first is the importance of an effective parliament. In an age of flux and dynamism, policy considerations are seldom linear and there may not be past blueprints and playbooks to rely on.",4,9,014-002-095-099-001-009,9
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"In most solutions, society is overall better off but there is often a cost where a segment may not benefit and this is where different views expressed during a debate is important for the clarity and transparency of all.",5,10,014-002-095-099-001-010,10
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"In such situations where we articulate different perspectives, I would like to echo Mdm President’s message that our conversations must be constructive, respectful and responsible, so that we draw strength from our diversity. To uphold trust in the effectiveness of parliament, we must conduct ourselves with integrity and civility, with truth and logic as the bedrock of what we say; so that at the end of the day, we galvanise our citizens towards a common direction.",6,11,014-002-095-099-001-011,11
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Like Singapore’s progress, we cannot take the effectiveness of our Parliament for granted. We should be careful not to follow the path of some parliaments in the world, where divisive politics and appealing rhetoric cloud genuine debates, such that they are not effective in making sound decisions and they confuse the people they serve.",7,12,014-002-095-099-001-012,12

I had the opportunity to participate in many of these debates.",9,14,014-002-095-099-001-014,14
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"In passing the multiple Budgets through COVID-19, we have protected lives and livelihoods, averting an economic meltdown; and even though we fared better and emerged stronger compared to many other countries, this House did not shy away from debating on how else we could have done better and how to proactively draw learnings from our experience to ready ourselves for future threats.",10,15,014-002-095-099-001-015,15
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"In the repeal of section 377A, we tackled this important topic even though we could have dealt with this further down the road. Importantly, we did not push the responsibility to the Courts to decide what is good for our society. We debated this issue sensitively with maturity and empathy, and we arrived at a balanced and win-win outcome.",11,16,014-002-095-099-001-016,16
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"And in increasing the GST rate, we bravely acknowledged the need for fiscal sustainability and prudence to support higher and longer-term expenditures, yet effectively transformed what is a potentially regressive tax regime into a holistic and progressive system through the innovative use of enhanced GST Vouchers and the Assurance Package, so that those who are vulnerable are protected, while those who are more well-off contribute more.",12,17,014-002-095-099-001-017,17
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"In these examples and others, considerations and trade-offs were put forth openly, so we could debate these robustly and transparently. As we look forward to the second session of the 14th Parliament, it is imperative that we continue to uphold the effectiveness, leadership and public confidence of this House.",13,18,014-002-095-099-001-018,18
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Sir, this brings me to the second theme of my speech – that is of clearly recognising the costs, trade-offs and constraints in the debates we make. Failure to recognise these “costs” defies the fundamental concept of scarcity in economics and could leave room for populist politics which will mislead and polarise our society.",14,19,014-002-095-099-001-019,19
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Singapore has enjoyed remarkable growth and development. While we continue to cheer and enable every citizen to maximise their potential and lift their ambitions, the hard truth is that it is impractical for our Government to fulfil all desires. Matching limited resources to meet ever-increasing and sometimes near-infinite expectations is an equation that cannot be solved by any government. Hence, this requires us to make choices and strike a balance for our policies to be sustainable.",15,20,014-002-095-099-001-020,20
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"For example, in debating housing accessibility, we all fully agree to younger Singaporeans’ aspirations towards convenience and proximity to their parents' home. However, it is simply not possible for everyone to be availed a Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat in a mature estate as space in such areas are finite. The key question will then be how to allocate them. And in terms of affordability, how should the Government balance between buyers desiring lower prices and sellers expecting higher valuations?",16,21,014-002-095-099-001-021,21
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"An even broader example concerns Singapore’s finances. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) has already stated that Singapore’s expenditures will increase and is projected to rise to 20% of GDP by 2030. The many calls for the Government to do more will mean that spending can easily increase beyond 20%. It is important for us to address transparently, how we are going to fund these increases, without kicking the can down the road.",17,22,014-002-095-099-001-022,22
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"I listened carefully to the Workers’ Party’s (WP) position on this. They oppose not just the GST increase but also the overall GST system, that today contributes $17 billion to our revenues.",18,23,014-002-095-099-001-023,23
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"The WP has offered some policy alternatives, such as to spend more from our Net Investment Returns Contribution or NIRC framework. However, the proposals are not viable to address funding shortfalls.",19,24,014-002-095-099-001-024,24
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"I said at the GST Bill debate, that to spend more from our investment returns and to save less, is an attractive but not a responsible approach. Singapore’s reserves serve as a strategic asset and insurance to support us during crises, and provide us a long-term, recurring and growing annuity to fund our rising national expenditures.",20,25,014-002-095-099-001-025,25
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"MOF has projected that NIRC contributions will be maintained at about the same percentage of GDP over the coming years; and we all know that norms in the economic and investment climate have turned to be more challenging. If we were to spend more from the NIRC now, it must mean that we leave behind less for our next generation. Should we take this path, I worry that our children will be the ones to bear the costs of a much bigger fiscal burden to fund future expenditures.",21,26,014-002-095-099-001-026,26
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"The WP is entitled to a different view, and I respect that. However, they need to be honest about the full implications and costs of their proposals, for current and future generations.",22,27,014-002-095-099-001-027,27
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"We should guard against short-sighted policies that go against our values and principles of how we uphold fiscal prudence. If we do not manage this carefully, trust in our fiscal stability, that we have painstakingly built over the years, can be destroyed overnight.",23,28,014-002-095-099-001-028,28
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"In its manifesto and in this debate, the WP has put forward many proposals, all of which will require more spending. In the coming session of Parliament, I look forward to hearing more from them the details of how the proposals will be funded, especially without GST.",24,29,014-002-095-099-001-029,29
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"In our debates, there will be some areas where we agree and some that we do not, like in the use of reserves. I am confident we will highlight our arguments and debate robustly about these issues. It will then be for Singaporeans to judge which is the more responsible and better approach to take Singapore forward.",25,30,014-002-095-099-001-030,30
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"In the end, it is not a battle between political parties. This is all about us, Singaporeans. How successful we will be, depends on how we approach these conundrums and trade-offs to make balanced policy choices for our society and for our society to see them as fair.",26,31,014-002-095-099-001-031,31
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"It is challenging, but I can see that our Government is dedicated to doing its best; and better relative to many other countries including the ones where I lived in, which is why I chose to return to Singapore; in fact, it is exactly because our Government sensibly acknowledges costs and trade-offs, that it is able to prioritise well and work hard so that our citizens benefit.",27,32,014-002-095-099-001-032,32
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"A microcosm of this is reflected in my own constituency at Nee Soon Link, that has many new Housing and Development Board (HDB) Build-To-Order (BTO) precincts. I have worked with many agencies to initiate and improve amenities, including launching a new bus service, including building many new bus stops when none were earlier catered for. And I am thankful to my residents who had moved in earlier for exercising patience, as we appealed successfully to improve the frequency of bus services when more residents settled into the estate.",28,33,014-002-095-099-001-033,33
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"It is from this perspective that I can attest to the dedication of our Government agencies towards serving our residents, demonstrating empathy and flexibility in calibrating public resources to meet needs on the ground, while ensuring value for money.",29,34,014-002-095-099-001-034,34
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Sir, an effective parliament and dedicated government are essential; but both by themselves cannot ensure Singapore’s progress. The final theme of my speech is how we all need to be hands on; for all of us, citizens to play our part.",30,35,014-002-095-099-001-035,35
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"In my maiden speech in this House, I spoke about how effective governance is not just about good policies, but also about good execution. Through the various Ministries’ addenda to the President’s Address, I am heartened to learn about the strong reaffirmation and refresh of their plans to take Singapore forward.",31,36,014-002-095-099-001-036,36
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Ultimately, while the Government can steer through sound policies, it is for our businesses, community partners, families and individuals to take their respective steps towards building a better Singapore.",32,37,014-002-095-099-001-037,37
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"In overcoming the crisis of a generation, we have seen first-hand how a formidable force is built from everyone playing a role, as well as from the partnership and trust between the government and its people. It is also heartening to see that within our towering metropolis and residences, the kampung spirit of old is well and alive.",33,38,014-002-095-099-001-038,38
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"I encourage all of us to uphold this sense of personal and collective responsibility; as well as to continue to look beyond personal interests, so we contribute to building a caring and more resilient society where no one is left behind.",34,39,014-002-095-099-001-039,39
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"The Forward Singapore exercise, aimed at renewing our social compact, encapsulates this ideal best. This social compact is an implicit agreement across Government, individuals, families, community and businesses on what kind of society we want to live in, and what each of us are willing to give – and give up – for one another. It aptly circles back to recognising trade-offs and requires all of us to answer, given constraints, what we desire to build and what we are willing to do more together with the Government for a better Singapore.",35,40,014-002-095-099-001-040,40
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"Sir, we now live in a world characterised by volatility; and where our long-held notions of geopolitical peace, globalisation and trade flows, and economic stability are challenged.",36,41,014-002-095-099-001-041,41
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"I started today’s speech on how the responsibility to bring Singapore forward now rest upon our shoulders. As we forge ahead in the new normal with cautious optimism, we ask not for a lighter load, but for greater strength.",37,42,014-002-095-099-001-042,42
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon),"I am convinced we can surmount the challenges and capture the opportunities that lie ahead if we come together as one Singapore because we are, Stronger Together! Sir, I support the Motion.",38,43,014-002-095-099-001-043,43

2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"  Mr Speaker, in her speech, President Halimah spoke about shifts in the geopolitical landscape and the implications that this will have on the Singapore economy. She described trends that we have been concerned about for a few years now – growing obstacles to global trade and economic nationalism. Both of these trends are expected to persist in the years to come and both of these trends are inflationary.",1,45,014-002-095-099-001-045,45
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Indeed, the latest Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) data showed that core consumer prices rose by 5.5% year on year in February, with food prices up more than 8%. We have not seen food prices go up so quickly since 2008.",2,46,014-002-095-099-001-046,46
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Although the MAS expects inflation to “slow more discernibly in the second half of this year” and hopefully “reach around 2.5% year on year by the end of 2023”, the projection for core consumer prices to rise by 3.5% to 4.5% over 2023 as a whole and for headline inflation to average 5.5% to 6.5% is still elevated compared to recent history and certainly out of the comfort range for many Singaporeans.",3,47,014-002-095-099-001-047,47
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Last year, wage growth for those of us who are employed full-time outpaced inflation but only barely. Real median incomes grew just 2% in 2022, almost half as fast as it used to grow in the pre-COVID-19 years.",4,48,014-002-095-099-001-048,48
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Working Singaporeans’ earnings power will be reduced again when the second GST hike kicks in in January 2024. I find it ironic that in its latest monetary policy statement, it appears the MAS took pains to highlight that the higher inflation rates we have seen at the start of the year “reflected in part the increase in GST” and that “when the impact of the GST increase is excluded, core inflation would be even lower and closer to the historical average”. Why add fuel to fire?",5,49,014-002-095-099-001-049,49
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"The Government’s support measures are designed to ensure that Singaporeans “with greater means contribute their fair share of taxes”. But from an inter-generational equity perspective, you can see why so many younger Singaporeans feel anxious and uneasy about the future. Some have even given up on the aspirations to raise a family here. Even some senior citizens I have met tell me that they worry most about how the higher cost of living impacts their children and feel compelled to carry on working, even though they may not wish to do so.",6,50,014-002-095-099-001-050,50
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"As workers and business owners, we will strive to be more productive and more competitive, and hope that our wages can go up higher than inflation. But I also hope that the Government can avoid introducing more pressure into the system through an untimely GST hike, especially if wage growth remains uneven or weak.",7,51,014-002-095-099-001-051,51
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Because when the cost of living – real or perceived – is too high, that hurts Singapore’s attractiveness as a liveable city, it weakens our younger one’s confidence to take risks and we become less competitive globally. Just last month, The Business Times reported that in a business sentiment survey conducted by the Singaporean-German Chamber of Industry and Commerce, almost half of German employers in Singapore polled, or 44%, said “psychological distress and lower work performance is visible among staff” due to the unpredictable housing situation.",8,52,014-002-095-099-001-052,52
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),My second point is about income security for workers who may find themselves displaced if labour market conditions deteriorate.,9,53,014-002-095-099-001-053,53
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Last week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that inflation is much stickier than anticipated even a few months ago and the chances of a “hard landing” for the global economy have risen sharply. Here in Singapore, gross domestic product (GDP) already fell sequentially by 0.7% in the first quarter of the year, with goods producing industries seeing a sharper 4.1% decline. While the Government has not updated its expectations for GDP growth of 0.5% to 2.5% in 2023, the risk of a recession is only getting higher.",10,54,014-002-095-099-001-054,54
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),"Some of you would know that I work in the banking sector, for a bank which is the subject of an emergency takeover. The recent turbulence at our firm has taken a very deep emotional toll on my friends and colleagues. In Singapore, job security is especially vexing because there is no nationally defined social protection floor that our workers can stand on to feel secure. There is also no law mandating retrenchment benefits in Singapore, which could be critical in ensuring displaced workers and their families have sufficient liquidity to meet basic living needs. This is especially pertinent during periods of recession and labour market weakness, where a longer time is needed to secure employment.",11,55,014-002-095-099-001-055,55
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang),I was therefore heartened to hear President Halimah say that the Government will study how it can extend support schemes similar to the COVID‐19 Recovery Grant beyond the pandemic. We should explore how the administrative arrangements for the COVID-19 Recovery grant can be adapted for a wider redundancy insurance scheme.

2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Next, let me move on to the Government’s push for greater use of digital payment, which has undoubtedly also facilitated and fuelled the increasing popularity of online shopping.",14,107,014-002-095-099-001-107,107
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Digital payment has risen sharply in recent years. The convenience of being able to make payments without having to carry cash or visiting a bank is a significant advantage. However, I would like to highlight three risks associated with digital payments.",15,108,014-002-095-099-001-108,108
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"First, the risk of data breach. With digital transactions, there is a rise in data collection, processing, sharing and storage of personal information. Hackers can steal this information, which could lead to identity theft, financial fraud, or other forms of cyber crime. Debit card fraud and phishing attacks are now a common occurrence, which could impact not only the individual but the entire banking system.",16,109,014-002-095-099-001-109,109
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Second, the risk of system failure. Digital payments rely heavily on technology and any system failure or technical glitch could result in significant problems. Last month, DBS customers were unable to log in to the bank’s online banking platforms, including its PayLah! mobile wallet, for almost a day. DBS' digital banking services previously suffered a two-day disruption in November 2021. Such incidences can create inconvenience and, in some cases, financial losses.",17,110,014-002-095-099-001-110,110
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Third, the risk of scams. The rise of digital payments has provided an opportunity for scammers to create fake e-wallets, websites and mobile applications to perpetuate their fraudulent activities. In October 2022, the MAS reported 610 cases of banking-related phishing scams involving PayNow transactions in 2021 and the first half of 2022. Victims lost large sums of money when the scammers deceived them into sharing their digital banking credentials.",18,111,014-002-095-099-001-111,111
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Sir, while digital payments provide convenience, it is important to be mindful of the risks that come with it and further strengthen our safeguards. Cybersecurity should be a top priority, and financial institutions need to implement advanced safety measures to prevent data breaches, system failures and fraudulent activities. More needs to be done also to educate vulnerable consumers, such as our seniors and those who are not technologically savvy, to stay updated and cautious when using these services.",19,112,014-002-095-099-001-112,112
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Finally, let me highlight the risks of unregulated short-term financing services such as Buy Now, Pay Later, which is prevalent today in many e-commerce platforms, and the need to establish more stringent limits on such transactions.",20,113,014-002-095-099-001-113,113
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"According to a 2021 report by Mileu, close to a fifth of Singaporeans aged 16 and above have used a Buy Now, Pay Later service. According to a report by WorldPay, Buy Now, Pay Later transactions are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 40% between 2021 and 2025.",21,114,014-002-095-099-001-114,114
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Such short-term financing services can appear enticing with their zero-interest deals, flexible payment options and convenience of access, but they come with a set of risks that can put unsuspecting customers in financial distress, especially for younger consumers below 21 as many of them do not yet have a stable income.",22,115,014-002-095-099-001-115,115
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"The first and most obvious risk is the accumulation of unforeseen fees and charges. Customers who fail to pay the required instalments on time are slapped with hidden fees and added interest, pushing up the total balance and making it harder to pay off the debt. Buy Now, Pay Later schemes also typically do not conduct credit checks, hence there is no pre-determined limit to how much a customer can borrow. This puts consumers at risk of overstretching their financial capabilities, leading to a spiral of debt.",23,116,014-002-095-099-001-116,116
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Another risk comes from the psychological impact of these schemes. With no immediate payment obligations, consumers may spend more than they would otherwise, as they feel less connected to the actual cost of purchases. This can lead to overspending and, in some cases, an addiction to online shopping.",24,117,014-002-095-099-001-117,117
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"CASE has called for safeguards to be introduced including limits to be set on purchases and penalty fees, credit assessment of potential users and integration of Buy Now, Pay Later spending data with credit ratings. Some of these proposals have been included in the industry’s Code of Conduct, which came into effect in November last year. But only some. We can and must do more. I urge the Government to impose regulations to better protect vulnerable consumers, such as the young and those already in debt, from exploitation by these schemes.",25,118,014-002-095-099-001-118,118
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas),"Sir, in conclusion, e-commerce has made significant progress in recent years, from the way businesses operate, to the way consumers find and purchase goods and services, to the way products are delivered to our doorsteps. It has opened a new world of possibilities and opportunities, but also presents new risks and dangers to consumers, both young and old. We must therefore review and update our consumer protection laws accordingly. Our laws must provide the same protection for consumers, regardless of whether we shop offline or online. Sir, notwithstanding the above, I support the Motion.",26,119,014-002-095-099-001-119,119

The content of my speech is meant for all participants in national politics, especially members of this House, including myself, and it is meant for all of us to conduct some self-reflection or introspection. In the words of a contemporary political phrase, “ownself check ownself”, in a positive manner.

2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-001,Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied),It is publicly known that Members of Parliament who are not from the ruling party need to put in more effort at the grassroots level to meet the needs of our constituents. This is because we do not have access to the resources of the People’s Association. This is because non-ruling party Members of Parliament who were elected to represent and serve their constituents during the general elections have been set aside in the appointment of Grassroots Advisors.,7,127,014-002-095-099-001-127,127

Apart from the usage of such places, the People’s Association funds meant for the benefit of the constituents also could not be touched. The same goes for manpower resources. The manpower provided by full-time constituency managers and directors is invaluable.",9,129,014-002-095-099-001-129,129

However, when I ask for details of those events, it turns out that they were referring to events held at the community club as well as those organised by the Residents’ Committtee. They said so because they saw the PAP Branch Chairman, who is also the Grassroots Advisor, present at these events as the guest of honour or the event organiser. In fact, some residents also said that their children received their Edusave awards from the PAP.",14,134,014-002-095-099-001-134,134

Despite the differences in opinion and principle, these differences did not cause divisions that could have damaged our society because of the existence of tolerance, mutual respect and a willingness to agree to disagree when facing a situation with no mutual consensus. This is what is known as unity in diversity.",25,145,014-002-095-099-001-145,145

Efforts to scare voters are unhealthy political practices that could lead to polarisation and division. For example, once upon a time, fears were raised that if a political party other than the ruling party is elected and runs the town council, it will lead to bad management to the extent that garbage will pile up as high as a two-storey flat.

If we are able to do that, it can also enhance the level of trust held by our citizens towards the national leadership system, which is another important factor mentioned by Madam President on that occasion.

Both in new areas, like the green and digital economies, also on ongoing projects like the Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link between Singapore and Johor Bahru. We are building the RTS Link marine viaduct across the Straits of Johor, starting from both sides and meeting in the middle. Construction is progressing steadily. The next big milestone is when we complete the drop-in span to join up both sides of the marine viaduct.

2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-003,The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Hsien Loong),"First, the war in Ukraine. After more than a year, the war is deadlocked, with no good outcome in sight. Neither side can win, nor can either afford to lose. In fact, things have been at a stalemate since last November. The Ukrainians are understandably reluctant to stop fighting before they reclaim all of their territory, but this will be very difficult. The Russians are most unlikely to be defeated entirely despite heavy losses. They have a large population and can still conscript more troops and mobilise more resources.",19,19,014-002-095-099-003-019,214

Even short of worst-case scenarios, the impact is bad. The war continues to disrupt global energy, food and fertiliser supplies. We are all feeling it in higher prices. There are also significant implications on international relations. Relations between Russia and the NATO countries, the US and Europe, have completely broken down and will not return to normal anytime soon.

The US and Europeans want China to use its influence to get Russia to stop the invasion. China would prefer not to aggravate Europe and the US, by providing military support for Russia’s war in Ukraine. But China is hard-pressed to condemn Russia’s invasion, or pressure Russia to stop fighting. It shares a very long land border with Russia, and it has to consider its own substantial relations with Russia. So, the war has made it difficult for China to improve relations with Europe, even though I think both sides would like to do so. It has also complicated China’s already very troubled ties with the US.",23,23,014-002-095-099-003-023,218

This has very serious implications, especially for small, open economies. For Singapore, a stable, well-functioning international trading system is vitally important.	We cannot survive other than as an open economy.	We rely on the free flow of trade and investments across the world and a common set of rules that applies to all countries, no matter their size.

The economic cost to the world will be very high. The IMF recently estimated that fragmentation of the global economy could, in the long run, reduce global GDP by 7% cumulatively. Seven percent is a very high figure – but I think it is a conservative estimate because the reality is probably worse. Seven percent is the effect on goods and services not traded, but deglobalisation will also impact on the exchange of ideas and innovation, technology development and diffusion, as well as capital flows and cross-border financing – all of which to growth prosperity and human well-being.

Africa is not the first place that comes to mind when Singaporeans think about venturing overseas. But there, I met several young Singaporeans living and working in Rwanda. One was running a poultry farm supplying chickens to restaurants in Kigali, Rwanda’s capital. Another was working with startups to raise financing. A third had started a distillery, brewing premium spirits, not just any hooch, but premium spirits. I asked him what it was, he said it is special rum. And he is hoping to make his rum brands as famous as single malt Scottish whiskeys. And there were a few more, too, including some women, who dared to take the path less travelled, and strike out on their own in these less familiar lands.",67,67,014-002-095-099-003-067,262

He had spent a year in Silicon Valley on the NUS Overseas Colleges (NOC) programme and he found it exhilarating. He picked up new skills, was inspired by the culture of innovation and the entrepreneurial spirit of the people he met. I asked about his plans after graduation. He told me he intends to start his own business, together with a few of his NOC Silicon Valley classmates.

An elderly resident, who used to work as a horticulturalist and recently found out he had stage 4 cancer, contacted me for help just a few days ago. He is unable to work now,but fortunately he has received assistance through MediFund – which I think is an important source of help – but needs additional help to support his family and spouse. He has no insurance coverage and I can imagine that, with recent cancer coverage changes, more of such cases will face financial challenges.

But we also cannot ignore the less active senior citizens and those who are not physically active enough to go out and enjoy recreation. Therefore, I was heartened to hear Minister Desmond Lee and other Members of Parliament mention the importance of cross-generation living. But not all estates will have this opportunity because we are ageing quickly.  Perhaps it is time for us to enhance or embark on a National Befriender Service for Seniors Living Alone programme and maybe consider some form of voluntary registration system, perhaps using technology, for seniors living alone, so that we can check on them periodically and engage them regularly at their convenience.",24,144,014-002-095-099-003-144,339

This has always been a sensitive topic because, as an Asian community, it is considered “unfilial” to “leave” one’s parents in nursing homes or old folks homes. However, as much as we want to ensure that we collectively support our seniors, there are still people who will need a place in nursing homes for the elderly. It is useful to find out the subscription levels for existing nursing homes and how MOH projects the demand until 2030 and beyond as well as plan ahead for possible increased demand.",25,145,014-002-095-099-003-145,340

The competition will not only be over business, but also over talent. Singaporean talent is sought after in many places in the world. Recently, Mr Chew Shou Zi dominated the headlines as he testified before the US Congress as CEO of TikTok.

While we continue to explore innovative and creative approach to manage our land, the fact is that land is scarce in Singapore and comes at a premium.

Indeed, the fact that Singapore has an ethnic Chinese majority population means that most Singaporeans would be able to trace their ancestry to somewhere in China, usually the southern coastal provinces. There are ties of culture and kinship. Moreover, with Singapore’s bilingual education policy, many Singaporeans of Chinese descent would be able to use the Chinese language to some degree, even though English is our working language. The sense of familiarity and ease makes it more convenient for ethnic Chinese Singaporeans to communicate and work with partners from China.

The following was put in particularly succinct terms by Professor Wang, who said   “…Singapore had started out with an extraordinary principle, not known in any nation I know of, one that recognised everyone born here as equal, and that the plural society would be the basis of a new nation. No other nation did that. As far as I know, every other nation began by saying that whoever was the majority would determine the fundamentals of nationhood… Singapore is the only one I know of in which it was the other way round; the majority accepted that they live in a plural society, in a neighbourhood in which they are a minority. They accepted that they had to treat everybody as equal and that the plural society was the foundation of Singapore’s nationhood.

For example, MediFund provides a safety net for patients who face difficulties with remaining medical bills after receiving Government subsidies and drawing on other means of payment, including those who need intermediate and long-term care in facilities, such as nursing homes. Can we consider extending its coverage to Adult Disability Homes which also provide long-term care? Of course, we must study this in detail and ensure that any such move is financially sustainable.

2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-003,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"We must provide the support for these single seniors to age well and allow them to enjoy their time together with their flat mates. They could be playing mahjong games, growing plants, cooking or whatever. To add, the co-living flat mates can also help to look out for one another, especially during medical emergencies and request for assistance in a timely manner.",22,438,014-002-095-099-003-438,633

2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-003,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"Other than securing a roof over their head, singles may also be concerned about securing their finances. In particular, the elderly are more likely to be vulnerable and exploited by scammers and other criminals. They may be preyed upon their confusion due to new technology. Recent scams via phones and online sites had depleted the bank accounts of many senior citizens, even those who are highly educated.",24,440,014-002-095-099-003-440,635
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-003,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"I strongly urge the Government to set up trust arrangements for the elderly, especially for singles who do not have partners nor children to help them. We do not have to reinvent the wheel. In fact, we can tap on current infrastructure, such as the CPF and accredited insurance companies, which are members of the Policy Owners' Protection Scheme under the Singapore Deposit Insurance Corporation. With economies of scale, the trust arrangement fees can be kept quite low. Their funds can be managed by the trusts which will pay for their expenses such as medical bills and release their pocket money monthly.",25,441,014-002-095-099-003-441,636

2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-003,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"(In Mandarin)  [Please refer to  Vernacular Speech.] During the final phase in life, many singles may be concerned that they do not have people whom they trust to assist them in preparing for their final days. For instance, they may need help with their Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) for decisions to be made should they lose their mental capacity.",27,443,014-002-095-099-003-443,638

Perhaps they may have assets that they wish to bequeath to charitable organisations but are not familiar with the arrangements. I urge MSF and VWOs to look into setting up such services to assist them, so that they can leave the world with a peace of mind.

Singapore has to be a place that is attractive, accessible and affordable for our seniors, so that they can live their final years comfortably. Involvement in community work will help singles feel more connected; friends and family and neighbours give them a purpose to stay on and contribute to their homeland.",30,446,014-002-095-099-003-446,641
2023-04-19,Debate on President's Address,014-002-095-099-003,Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang),"I hope the Ministry of Community, Culture and Youth (MCCY) can work with PA and VWOs to attract more singles to participate in community work. In particular, cause-based programmes. There are many programmes that are designed to engage families with young children but singles may feel they do not fit in and are not keen to be a part of such programmes. We need to make singles feel welcomed.",31,447,014-002-095-099-003-447,642
